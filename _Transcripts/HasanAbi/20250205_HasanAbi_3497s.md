# Public Outraged Over Trump's Gaza Control Declaration | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k)
*  communist myself, I was firmly committed to Donald Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=0.0s)]
*  peaceful dove attitudes, despite the obvious reality that his [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=4.32s)]
*  previous dealings with Israel, unironically set the stage for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=8.96s)]
*  October 7, as I repeated 1 million times throughout this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=15.8s)]
*  entire process. How could that guy be? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=21.12s)]
*  For me, I didn't really saw that as a super serious kind of a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=23.96s)]
*  situation. Great. The smartest guy is up to the task. The [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=32.2s)]
*  number one advocate, this f**king ogre. And it's really just [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  trying to shake things up and just announce like there is some [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=41.32s)]
*  truths about Gaza. How are somebody able to leave there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  right now when probably 85 to 90% or more of the buildings are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=48.16s)]
*  destroyed or seriously damaged? So where are people going to live [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=52.56s)]
*  and how things are going to go? And how can you rebuild Gaza [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=55.88s)]
*  until Hamas is still allowed to endure? So there's a lot of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=59.0s)]
*  questions. And where's the money going to come from? So this is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  about, I think for me, I didn't take it as like a serious [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=66.76s)]
*  situation. And it's just about shaking things up. But I'm not [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=69.2s)]
*  going to freak out on it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=72.56s)]
*  It's a bold move, certainly. Far bolder than what's been done [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=73.76s)]
*  before. But I think we've got- [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Bold. That's the way I would describe it. The final solution [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=79.48s)]
*  is bold. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=83.04s)]
*  I stand unequivocally in an unwavering manner, as the whip [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=84.16s)]
*  said, with Israel, our closest ally and friend in the Middle [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=87.4s)]
*  East. And I think if we could bring control that situation and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=91.08s)]
*  bring about a lasting peace there, it would do well for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  everybody, not just in the region, but around the world. It's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  a volatile place. And I think the strong and decisive move is an [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=99.48s)]
*  important step in that regard. As, as was noted earlier, prime [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=103.16s)]
*  minister Netanyahu being the first international leader to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=107.12s)]
*  meet with the president in the White House is, is more than [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=109.72s)]
*  symbolism, but it is a symbol. And it shows the world that we're [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=112.64s)]
*  not going to equivocate. The previous administration did that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=116.2s)]
*  They tried to appease Iran and by extension, its proxies, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=118.72s)]
*  terrorists, and, and they frankly encumbered Israel in so [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=121.96s)]
*  many times. You're seeing a reversal of that now. That is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=125.64s)]
*  very important development. I think our allies around the world [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=128.76s)]
*  appreciate that. I know, because I talked to lots of leaders [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=131.48s)]
*  around the world, and they've been very nervous about the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=134.16s)]
*  instability there. I think this could be a bold step in that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=136.68s)]
*  regard. So let's, let's withhold judgment on all of it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=139.44s)]
*  This is an extraordinarily dangerous approach for the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=141.72s)]
*  president to take and not consistent with American values. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=146.12s)]
*  The president has simply been treating Gaza as if it were one [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=151.88s)]
*  more real estate development opportunity. It is the homeland [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=160.52s)]
*  of many people. The official policy of the United States [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=165.88s)]
*  continues to be two states where two peoples can live side by side [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=170.6s)]
*  with security, dignity and in peace. I hope the president of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  the United States aligns himself with longstanding US policy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=181.76s)]
*  The president talked about an idea last night. I listened to it [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=187.32s)]
*  carefully. He talked about an idea. He hasn't fleshed out that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  idea yet. I feel [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=197.36s)]
*  the, the silly part about all of this is that like these policy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=199.84s)]
*  decisions are being made by an abject ass who just says whatever [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=205.08s)]
*  comes to his mind in that immediate moment. And it's very [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=209.44s)]
*  malleable too. So every single person has to turn around and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=212.88s)]
*  play catch up after Trump comes out and we'll just be like, yeah, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  we're going to do the final solution on the Palestinians. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=222.76s)]
*  Like, and it's going to be beautiful. We're going to build [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=224.84s)]
*  a beautiful parking lot over the graves of hundreds of that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  worse. And everyone has to be like, no, no, no, he doesn't mean [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=231.6s)]
*  that actually. Here's what he actually means. That would be [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  crazy. You know, that'd be crazy if he said that, I mean, come [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=236.88s)]
*  on, that's not what it is. I mean, it's a bold move. It's a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=240.16s)]
*  bold agenda. He's right, but this is what he actually means. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=242.56s)]
*  That's what they, that's, this is literally the redo of the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=245.96s)]
*  first admin. Okay, that's it. They're all f*****s. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=250.52s)]
*  Certainly the White House is going to welcome input. I don't [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  think anybody ought to, ought to start jumping to conclusions [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=258.76s)]
*  here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=265.52s)]
*  I think what the president's trying to do is find a path [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  forward. And I think what he wants to do is a peaceful [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  approach. He, look, he doesn't like it when people are at war. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=270.92s)]
*  He's made that very clear. And what he's offered is, is let's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=273.84s)]
*  talk about the value of this land to begin with. And let's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=277.88s)]
*  let everybody be reminded that this is a valuable piece of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=280.88s)]
*  property and the people that live there should recognize how [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=283.44s)]
*  valuable it could be if there was peace in the region. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=286.08s)]
*  I thought this was a guy that was going to end America's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  endless wars. I don't know if this was just off the cuff, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe that the Republicans are hypocritical [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=296.52s)]
*  guys. You heard that? I can't believe that the Republicans [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=300.36s)]
*  were lying when they said that they would be peaceful. I for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=304.24s)]
*  one am shocked as a mega communist myself. I was firmly [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  committed to Donald Trump's peaceful dove attitudes, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  despite the obvious reality that his previous dealings with [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=318.24s)]
*  Israel, unironically set the stage for October 7, as I [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=324.24s)]
*  repeated 1 million times throughout this entire process. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=329.4s)]
*  How could that guy be? How could that peaceful dove who was [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  president for four years and was not peaceful at all be not [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=337.76s)]
*  peaceful again? Shocking color me surprised. Ladies and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=341.32s)]
*  gentlemen, I am genuinely shocked. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  When you're president of the United States, your words [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=350.2s)]
*  matter. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=351.96s)]
*  If you thanked Trump for his content farming, allowing you to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  shine. I hate this. Okay. The idea that, Oh man, Donald Trump [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=355.88s)]
*  is really great for content. This is not content. This is [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=361.64s)]
*  cleansing, dude. What are we talking about? The craziest part [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  about this once again, is that a lot of people in the Western [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=368.4s)]
*  world will look at this and go, well, I'm not Palestinian. It's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=373.4s)]
*  just content, right? Oh, it's just content. Who cares? It's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=376.23999999999995s)]
*  content from the way that we're viewing it because we're far [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=379.0s)]
*  removed from the danger, except you're not far removed from the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=381.44s)]
*  danger when it's Donald Trump. Okay. It's not, it's not just [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=384.44s)]
*  content and you yourself are not sheltered from the worst impact. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  I promise you, you're not sheltered at all from the impact [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=392.52s)]
*  of this. This is going to be consequential regardless. Maybe [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=395.64s)]
*  not the Palestine issue, even though the Palestine issue I can [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=398.24s)]
*  present to you as, as being consequential for your [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=401.24s)]
*  immediate, for your immediate experiences in the United States [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=404.64s)]
*  of America, because you know, we're just going to keep giving [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=408.44s)]
*  billions and billions of dollars in weapons to Israel rather than [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=411.16s)]
*  fixing some of these problems. Right. But I don't know that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  Don't believe him. The Ezra Klein show video would love to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=418.92s)]
*  hear your opinion on this retrospect of the last two weeks [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  in Trump strategy of blasting media with unending noise and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=423.04s)]
*  chaos. Yeah. I, this is, this is truly making me reconsider [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=425.12s)]
*  literally flying back home. Even, even a Japanese flight had a [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=432.88s)]
*  collision at the Seattle airport. I really do hope it's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=437.4s)]
*  just a matter of people hyper-focusing. It was a ground [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=442.0s)]
*  collision. I know like a fender bender. I really hope it's just [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=444.96s)]
*  the media hyper-focusing on like plane collisions and things of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  that nature that are normally routine and not that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=454.4s)]
*  consequential. Also they're calling it D I would just so [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=457.08s)]
*  funny. Yeah. I've been flying my whole life since I was a baby. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=460.4s)]
*  Okay. And this is one of the first instances in the past 33 [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=465.4s)]
*  years where I felt like just a tad bit uneasy. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=470.59999999999997s)]

*  not sure whether this was off the cuff or a strategy, but in [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=486.8s)]
*  either case, I think it actually sets back the cause of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=492.04s)]
*  peace in that region. I believe that what the president's really [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=497.48s)]
*  trying to say is we've got to do things differently in Gaza. And [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=500.44s)]
*  one thing we can have for a long term safe Gaza is Hamas. So I [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=503.88s)]
*  think he's right. Just saying that we need to have a clean [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=509.28000000000003s)]

*  press conference, but I think directionally he's on the, he's [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=518.24s)]
*  on the right track. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=521.0s)]
*  Well, there's taking over Gaza, there's helping rebuild Gaza, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=521.92s)]
*  probably need some clarification on what exactly that means. He's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=526.4s)]

*  probably among them. Perhaps with a little bit of facilitation [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=544.64s)]
*  from the United States, clearly Gaza doesn't belong to the United [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=549.96s)]

*  illegal. And the United States will not be invading Gaza. We [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=559.08s)]

*  what's happening where people are just like receiving this as [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=589.0s)]

*  Mr. President, given what you've said about Gaza, to the US and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=657.0s)]

*  Now Netanyahu appeared open to the idea Saudi Arabia's foreign [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=669.6400000000001s)]
*  ministry says it rejects any attempts to displace Palestinians [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=672.72s)]

*  strongly against any forced displacement of the Palestinians. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=678.44s)]
*  Egypt Jordan, other American allies in the region have [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=681.8000000000001s)]
*  previously rejected the idea of relocating the more than 2 [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=684.32s)]

*  own Peter Ducey asked Netanyahu the following question. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=690.76s)]
*  We have heard Joe Biden and Donald Trump take credit for the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=695.2s)]
*  hostage and ceasefire deal. Who do you think deserves more [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=699.96s)]
*  credit? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=704.24s)]
*  I think President Trump added great force and powerful [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=705.6s)]
*  leadership to this effort. I appreciate it. He sent a very [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=711.24s)]
*  good emissary. He's helped it along. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=717.0s)]
*  So that was in the Oval Office before the news conference. Now [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=720.2800000000001s)]
*  Trump says the US will own Gaza and be responsible for [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=722.68s)]
*  dismantling all the unexploded ordinance. He said he wants to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=725.68s)]
*  level Gaza and get rid of the destroyed buildings and rebuild [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=728.64s)]
*  it. Guys? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=731.76s)]
*  You know, Nalukis is no doubt. I mean, they're in a situation [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=733.0s)]
*  where they have to make a decision because Netanyahu says [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=735.8s)]
*  there's no way Hamas will stay in charge. Michael Waltz says [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  that the Trump administration position is there's no way [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=741.52s)]
*  Hamas stays in charge. But if you've seen the hostage take [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=744.12s)]
*  over, they're still the number one presence in the area. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=747.0799999999999s)]
*  They're the ones still with the guns. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=750.6800000000001s)]
*  That's right. And we saw those Hamas soldiers fully kitted out [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=753.0s)]
*  with brand new uniforms, brandishing weapons, Hamas still [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=755.64s)]
*  a force there in Gaza. Also, let's just think just a few days [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=758.84s)]
*  ago when Trump was talking about leveling tariffs on Mexico and [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=762.6s)]
*  Canada, you saw a big about face. Perhaps this announcement [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=765.64s)]
*  will get the attention of other allies in the Middle East, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=768.6s)]
*  guys. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=771.0s)]
*  Indeed. All right, Lucas, thank you very much for the live [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=771.64s)]
*  report from DC. So it was such a jaw dropper last night. The [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=774.52s)]
*  cover of the New York Post is we'll take over Gaza. And you [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=780.08s)]
*  got to wonder where this idea came from. I know Jared Kushner [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=783.44s)]
*  had told the president a year or two ago, he said Gaza's waterfront [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=786.32s)]
*  property could be very valuable and suggested the Israelis move [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=790.0s)]
*  the people out and then clean it up. Donald Trump is a [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=793.72s)]
*  developer. He sees the potential. But then again, we're [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=796.44s)]
*  talking about land that people have fought over for decades and [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=799.5200000000001s)]
*  it would involve moving the Palestinians out. It looks like [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=803.24s)]
*  Trump and Netanyahu discussed it, but they didn't really talk [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  to the other side because as Lucas detailed some of the other [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=809.72s)]
*  sides involved like Hamas has said no. The no's so far that I [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  just was reading about in the Times of Israel. Egypt is a no, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=816.6s)]
*  Hamas is a no, Saudi Arabia is a no, and China is a no. And [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=821.1600000000001s)]
*  there's an op-ed in the Times of Israel, right? Plan won't happen [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  but could shake up the region because new ideas are needed. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=829.2s)]
*  This might spark more viable solutions. And that's what Donald [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=832.32s)]
*  Trump said yesterday. We need new ideas. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=835.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it's going to force the Muslim world to find [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=837.1999999999999s)]
*  a solution as well. I think it's going to give the president a [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=840.7199999999999s)]
*  lot of leverage. Something has to give. And I don't know if [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=843.28s)]
*  this is the solution. But I tweeted out last night, let me [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=846.16s)]
*  just sleep on this. Let me just sleep on this. I think so often [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=849.68s)]
*  when the president puts a radical idea out there to change [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=852.88s)]
*  the conversation around the issue, people just freak out. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's what the media did last night. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=859.92s)]
*  If America looked like Gaza, I would consider leaving. If [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  you know, if I had to live in those conditions. Exactly. I mean, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=867.56s)]
*  every time we show video of it, I'm like, I cannot believe [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=871.24s)]
*  people live like this, because we're so blessed and fortunate [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=874.6s)]
*  here in America. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=877.0799999999999s)]
*  It's like the wildfires, but eventually people want to go [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  back. And that's the problem. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's a little different because it's so gorgeous in [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=881.64s)]
*  California, you do have to risk the wildfire, especially if [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=884.24s)]
*  you're not going to get insurance for it. But when you [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=886.8s)]
*  look at the video of Gaza, that is no place I would ever want to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=888.68s)]
*  go or visit. And he says he's not specifying where this new [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=891.4s)]
*  land for Gazans might be. But he said, you know what? Why not? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=894.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to leave, I guess, if you don't want to. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=898.1999999999999s)]
*  But if you have the opportunity for economic development and [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=900.64s)]
*  supplied unlimited number of jobs and housing and a good, fresh, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=903.8399999999999s)]
*  beautiful piece of land, like he calls [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel's a natural disaster. According to Fox, Israel's a [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=909.16s)]
*  natural disaster, according to liberals too, and the way that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=911.5999999999999s)]
*  they presented it for the longest time, but also on top of that. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=916.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about like, we're talking about mass [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=921.3599999999999s)]
*  ethnic displacement. Okay. It's ethnic cleansing. It's the final [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=925.52s)]
*  solution. They're going to take 1.8 million Palestinians, which [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=929.68s)]
*  by the way, is also a really devastating number because as [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=934.12s)]
*  far as I understand, pre October seven, the number of [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  Palestinians that resided in Gaza was 2.3 by conservative [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=941.12s)]
*  estimates all the way up to 2.5 is what I've seen. Okay. So [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=945.8399999999999s)]
*  that would mean if there's 1.8 million Palestinians, that means [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=950.56s)]
*  the number of the dead and displaced is significantly higher [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=954.6s)]
*  than what we have seen thus far. Okay. What we've heard thus [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=959.88s)]
*  far, if it goes from 2.3 to 1.8, that's not 40,000 50,000 [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=964.56s)]
*  people. Okay. That's number one. Number two, the further [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=968.88s)]
*  displacement of the, the remaining 1.8 million civilians [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=973.72s)]
*  is insane. I mean, it's just the final solution. This is stuff [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=978.96s)]
*  that you read in history books and looked at and went, wow, how [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=982.48s)]
*  cruel, how could people be on board with this? And here you [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=985.44s)]
*  are watching exactly how people can be on board with it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  What? Wait a minute. You've been lying about the numbers. I [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=992.1600000000001s)]
*  don't believe it. What I've been lying about the numbers. What? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=994.6s)]
*  All right, let's just keep going. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  Why, why wouldn't you consider it? Why wouldn't they say, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1001.6800000000001s)]
*  thanks for doing this? Netanyahu said one thing that I thought [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1003.88s)]
*  was interesting. He said, you say things others refuse to say, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1006.3199999999999s)]
*  talking about Donald Trump. And after the jaws drop, people [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1009.48s)]
*  scratch their heads and they say, you know, he's right. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1012.8399999999999s)]
*  Just doing a little bit of the history. You had the Palestinians [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1016.6s)]
*  in Jordan. That chatter added me, but he was, I think talking [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1019.8s)]
*  about the mainstream narrative, like that they've been lying [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1022.68s)]
*  about it. They created havoc. They threw them out. They were in [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1025.0s)]
*  Lebanon. They were creating havoc. They tossed him out. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1028.72s)]
*  They were in Egypt in the 1920s and they basically gave [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1031.52s)]
*  birth to what we now know as Al Qaeda. That's Hamas is a [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1036.12s)]
*  division of that. They got tossed out. So they could became [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1039.52s)]
*  Israel's problem. And we know about the bow for agreement. So [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1042.6799999999998s)]
*  now they had in the Oslo situation, they said, what if we [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1045.84s)]
*  gave you Gaza and West bank and Clinton said, we build a bridge, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1048.84s)]
*  both of them, that'll be your state. Yara Sarah fed [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1053.04s)]
*  essentially said, yeah, if I do that, they'll kill me because we [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1055.76s)]
*  basically want all of Israel. So if you want all of Israel, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  there's no, there's going to be more October 7th. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1061.6399999999999s)]
*  I didn't really think that there would be, I did not think that [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1064.52s)]
*  there would be an even more wrong approach to this. Okay. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1074.6799999999998s)]
*  It's, I don't know what else to say, man is crazy. Why do you [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1081.84s)]
*  repeat the 40 K so many times when it had come out in last [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1086.32s)]
*  December and medical orgs estimated since then 200 K at [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1088.6s)]
*  this point, repeating that number is genocide denials them [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1092.2s)]
*  akin to doing so with the Holocaust. No, the 40,000 [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1094.8s)]
*  number, as I've stated time and time again, is the, it is a [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1098.72s)]
*  larger than that. I think it's like 50,000 now is the number [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1102.92s)]
*  that the Palestinian health ministry has given. Okay. And [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1106.6000000000001s)]
*  that number in and of itself is not even the total number of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1111.68s)]
*  death. A lot of people, I think, Oh, 60,000. Okay. It's 61,000 [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1115.72s)]
*  from the health ministry now. Okay. Understand something that [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1121.96s)]
*  number that 61,000 number is not the total number of the dead. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1126.1200000000001s)]
*  That 61,000 number is the total number that was killed by direct [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1130.8s)]
*  Israeli gunfire or direct Israeli bombs. There are still [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1135.88s)]
*  thousands of people that are under the rubble and no one has [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1143.16s)]
*  been identified. There are still a 10 X number most likely that [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1146.8000000000002s)]
*  will die as a direct consequence of the, and has died as a [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1152.5200000000002s)]
*  direct consequence of the medical infrastructure being [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1156.1200000000001s)]
*  destroyed as a direct consequence of other issues such as famine, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1158.0s)]
*  cholera, and the spread of diseases that happen because one, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1162.1200000000001s)]
*  there is no medical infrastructure because it's been [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1166.5600000000002s)]
*  deliberately destroyed by Israel and two, because people have no [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1168.2800000000002s)]
*  access to medicine in general. Okay. Because their aid is being [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1172.2s)]
*  limited. So the Lancet study estimations that came out last [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1175.88s)]
*  year that said the number currently the official number at [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1181.6000000000001s)]
*  the time was, I think 40,000, but the number of dead by the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1185.2800000000002s)]
*  end of this, by the end of this process will be far larger than [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1188.3200000000002s)]
*  that was an estimation judging by previous instances of, of [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1192.8000000000002s)]
*  sieges, war and ethnic cleansing campaigns. Okay. There are [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1200.4s)]
*  plenty of people who die not on a hospital bed by direct gunfire [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1204.36s)]
*  from Israeli soldiers that are not recovered by the Palestinian [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1209.7199999999998s)]
*  Health Ministry. So the number that they're offering, the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1213.3999999999999s)]
*  number that they're offering is, is incredibly conservative and [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1217.1599999999999s)]
*  far from the actual number of the Palestinians that have been [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1221.52s)]
*  killed. Okay, they can only count the bodies that are brought [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1225.4399999999998s)]
*  to the hospitals and those figures are simply the numbers of [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1229.56s)]
*  people that have died due to direct Israeli munitions, gunfires [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1233.4s)]
*  or bombs. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1239.5600000000002s)]
*  And you rocket to Israel every single day. Israel just had 1100 [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1241.72s)]
*  innocent people including babies killed in the most horrific way [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1246.44s)]

*  revisit all of this, but we are so done. It is really two areas, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1259.88s)]
*  Palestinians and Iran, everybody else and we're going to talk to [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1265.16s)]
*  get to Qatari, foreign minister, special advisor shortly. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1269.0s)]

*  Clearly America is now expressing clearly that they [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1322.48s)]
*  want to occupy permanently, probably Gaza. They want the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1326.12s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1331.4399999999998s)]

*  That's not what he said. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1336.32s)]

*  many of these left organizations have, they're going to say we [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1339.84s)]

*  Well, and so far they say they're not going to leave. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1352.84s)]
*  And that's the problem right there. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1355.48s)]
*  My question is how much is it going to cost? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1357.68s)]
*  I mean, we've got Elon Musk going through the federal [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1359.6s)]

*  The Arab world, Saudi Arabia said this morning no ties with [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1365.16s)]
*  Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1368.8s)]
*  So they are a firm no on the idea. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1371.16s)]
*  They're not going to be a threat to us in the future. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1373.2s)]
*  Although there are people who are already talking about how it [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1375.04s)]

*  A lot of people. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  David Friedman, the ambassador for Israel during the Trump years, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1381.3600000000001s)]
*  he suggested, so will we call it Mara Gaza or Gaza Lago? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1385.0800000000002s)]
*  And then Marco Rubio said the United States. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1391.28s)]
*  They've been debating internally, according to my sources, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1394.16s)]
*  recognizing as the United States of America, the renaming of the [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1396.92s)]
*  West Bank to Judea and Samaria. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1400.56s)]
*  There's a bill about that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1402.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1403.08s)]
*  Annexation. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1403.44s)]
*  That's what they're talking about. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1404.0s)]
*  It's not exactly annexation. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1405.2s)]
*  You know what? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1406.3999999999999s)]
*  Let me actually... [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  Just erasing the name of the West Bank. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1407.04s)]
*  Let me go ahead and play this because this is the man that Trump [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1408.24s)]
*  has chosen as the ambassador to Israel. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1411.32s)]
*  And everything that we're talking about here was telegraphed by him. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1413.32s)]
*  And this is in 2008 and in 2017. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1416.24s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1418.56s)]
*  Basically, there really is no such thing as... [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1421.36s)]
*  I have to be careful in saying this because people are really good at this. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1424.2s)]
*  There's really no such thing as a Palestinian. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1427.28s)]
*  My feelings personally, and I'm speaking only as a person, I think [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1428.6799999999998s)]
*  Israel would only be acting on the property it already owns. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1434.8799999999999s)]
*  I think Israel has titled Ede. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1438.6s)]
*  I blame Hassan. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1443.32s)]

*  If you want to know the true insane people, if you want to know, if you [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1450.84s)]

*  Zionist Jewish population in America, it's the ultra Zionist, far right [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1465.9599999999998s)]
*  evangelical Christians. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1476.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1479.0s)]
*  They are completely and utterly psychotic. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1479.6399999999999s)]
*  I have no idea what you're saying. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1484.0s)]
*  Judea and Samaria. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1485.9599999999998s)]
*  There are certain words I refuse to use. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1488.24s)]
*  There is no such thing as a West Bank. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1490.76s)]
*  It's Judea and Samaria. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1492.24s)]
*  There's no such thing as a settlement. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1493.84s)]
*  They're communities, they're neighborhoods, they're cities. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1495.12s)]
*  By the way, Bill Clinton also repeated these takes in Dearborn, leading up to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1497.12s)]
*  the election, operating as a spokesperson for Kamala Harris. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1501.76s)]
*  Incredible stuff. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1505.48s)]
*  There's no such thing as an occupation. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1507.48s)]
*  This is illegal. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1510.24s)]

*  It's a violation of every convention that the United States, by the way, was [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1517.2800000000002s)]
*  part of. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1522.3200000000002s)]
*  It's a violation of every UN resolution. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1523.24s)]
*  It's a violation of international court of justice and international criminal [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1528.52s)]
*  court resolutions. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1531.8400000000001s)]

*  international law is dead. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1536.6000000000001s)]
*  Is international law dead? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1539.0s)]
*  Because I think Rula is right in suggesting that that's basically what Trump [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1540.8s)]
*  is suggesting. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1543.8799999999999s)]
*  Forcibly removing Palestinians from their land is against international law. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1544.8s)]
*  I think we're being a little dramatic and we're on our jump to conclusions. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1553.2s)]
*  Matt here a little bit. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1556.8799999999999s)]
*  He muses occasionally. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1557.96s)]
*  Taking that as a word. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1559.04s)]
*  He muses occasionally. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1559.84s)]
*  I love you, Scott. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1560.92s)]
*  Just to be clear, because you're suggesting that we are making this up or [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1561.92s)]
*  No, I'm not suggesting anything. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1565.48s)]
*  No, you're putting words in my mouth. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1567.08s)]
*  I'm saying you and I both know he muses occasionally and he's aspirational and he [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1568.9199999999998s)]
*  says provocative things occasionally. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1573.08s)]
*  Look, I really don't want to interrupt you, but I just to for my own, you know, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1574.1599999999999s)]
*  I think I have to come to my own defense here in saying Donald Trump, with his [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1579.24s)]
*  own words, said this is what he wants to do. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1584.48s)]
*  He was amusing. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1587.04s)]
*  He was looking down at a piece of paper. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1588.04s)]
*  I've been in a room with him just like that with foreign leaders, looking down at [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1589.6799999999998s)]
*  a piece of paper. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1593.6399999999999s)]
*  He is reading a statement that was prepared for him. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1594.1599999999999s)]
*  Those are not musings. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1596.72s)]
*  Well, Scott, what happened to America first? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1598.0s)]
*  So I think this is the guy who was supposed to take us out of the endless wars that [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1600.16s)]
*  he's against nation building. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1603.16s)]
*  He railed against IM. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1604.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1606.32s)]
*  Playing the role of Catherine tonight. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1606.6s)]

*  Look, I don't know that I agree with the terminology you're using. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1613.16s)]
*  Here's what I think. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1617.64s)]
*  It's provocative. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1618.48s)]
*  It's an interesting conversation point. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1620.48s)]
*  Donald Trump, he's the only person in the world speaking positively about this [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1623.6s)]
*  particular geography right now. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1629.2s)]
*  And I will just say, I will just say that in the first term, he did something rather [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1631.36s)]
*  audacious with the Abraham Accords, highly successful. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1637.6s)]
*  He's always thought positively and aspirationally about the Middle East. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1640.3999999999999s)]
*  And I would just ask all of you all who were enraged about this, how's it going [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1643.84s)]
*  right now? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1647.16s)]
*  How's the current management doing? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1647.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1649.3999999999999s)]
*  Not really, not really all that well. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1649.76s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1651.12s)]
*  And that's because of Americans weapons and American inability to enforce. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1651.76s)]
*  You're blaming us for the management problems in Gaza. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1656.32s)]
*  Come on. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1659.0s)]
*  Wasn't doing a great job before. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1659.36s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1660.8799999999999s)]
*  We have a 58 year old occupation that is illegal, that decimated people, hopes and [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1662.04s)]
*  lives. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1668.1599999999999s)]
*  And I am the only Palestinian here. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1668.84s)]
*  And I must say that it's honestly the fact that we are not able to put in perspective [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1670.32s)]
*  that's the history of that region. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  Before October 7th, hundreds of people were killed. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1678.04s)]
*  After October 7th, still thousands and thousands of people are getting killed. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1681.28s)]
*  And what happened on that day? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1685.4399999999998s)]
*  For 58 years. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1686.2399999999998s)]
*  What happened on that day? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1687.2399999999998s)]
*  You know what? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1688.2399999999998s)]
*  What happened on that day? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1688.8s)]
*  Actually, Secret Service of Israel had been predicted what happened on that day. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1690.08s)]
*  What happened on that day is we had basically a border that was breached because we [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1693.8799999999999s)]
*  have a government in Israel. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1702.4399999999998s)]
*  And as I am an Israeli Palestinian government, we had a government in Israel that [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1703.8799999999999s)]
*  favored annexation and bug rooms in the West Bank. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1707.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm just asking what happened that day. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1710.52s)]
*  I want to tell you something. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1711.84s)]
*  We had a government, we had the prime minister who said Hamas is an asset. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1713.2s)]
*  We need to finance Hamas. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1716.84s)]
*  He's the one that sent to Doha, the head of the secret service, three weeks before [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1718.32s)]
*  October 7th, to ask the Qataris to finance Hamas. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1722.12s)]
*  But you don't want to say what happened that day. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1724.76s)]
*  It's an atrocity that happened that day. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1727.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1729.8s)]
*  But that atrocity doesn't justify the atrocities and the war crimes and the genocidal [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1730.0s)]
*  campaign that happened after it was fought. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1737.84s)]
*  I totally reject everything you just said about genocide, war crimes. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1739.4s)]
*  Israel has never right to defend itself. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1742.4s)]
*  I don't want us to get off course because I think that it is easy to redirect this [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1744.24s)]
*  conversation about October 7th when what we're talking about right now is what happens [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1751.5600000000002s)]
*  today and tomorrow and what comes next. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1758.0800000000002s)]
*  And I want to ask you just a follow up to what you said. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1760.5600000000002s)]
*  Hold on. A follow up to what you said. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1763.0400000000002s)]
*  Trump is talking positively about the region. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1765.4s)]
*  But in his view of Gaza, the Palestinians do not exist. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1767.52s)]
*  How is that something that is positive for Palestinians? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1772.44s)]
*  Two million people that live there right now. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1776.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he didn't give a lot of details about how he envisions the future for [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1780.04s)]
*  that population. And I certainly am not in a position to flesh it out either, because [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1783.72s)]
*  I don't know what he means by that. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1788.0s)]
*  Here's what I do know. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1790.0s)]
*  Current management failing. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1791.16s)]
*  A president of the United States who's speaking positively about what could be [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1793.16s)]
*  happening in that region. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1796.6s)]
*  And you all talk about the Middle East being on fire and nobody seems to want to [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1798.08s)]
*  acknowledge on whose watch it was set ablaze. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1801.24s)]
*  And so I look, I think sometimes I think sometimes he talks about it. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1803.6799999999998s)]
*  It's just a conversation. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1808.76s)]
*  I know that displacing millions of people from sending us sending us. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1809.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it's also necessary. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1815.8799999999999s)]
*  I said this earlier, but the fact that the fact that we still hold on, the fact we [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1817.28s)]
*  still have hostages, the fact we still have hostages that aren't brought back yet. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1821.56s)]
*  The fact that that seems to be somewhat of an overlooked portion of this entire [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1825.12s)]
*  we have a deal. Not only that, I'm interested to see in the people smarter than me [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1829.6399999999999s)]
*  about this. But what effect does this have on any ceasefire deal? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1833.8799999999999s)]
*  What effect does this have? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1836.7199999999998s)]
*  And he suggested that it might actually affect it. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1838.1599999999999s)]
*  And so that's my point. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1842.12s)]
*  I mean, if there are people if there are people who have, you know, the innocent men, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1843.6399999999999s)]
*  women and children, Palestinian babies and innocent women and children in their heart [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1848.56s)]
*  and minds at the forefront, then they want to ceasefire. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1853.2s)]
*  We want to ceasefire. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  If there are individuals who want the hostages brought home, then they want a ceasefire. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1856.2s)]
*  So those hostages can be brought home. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1859.8000000000002s)]
*  Today makes no sense in actually moving that ball down the field. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  And what about these? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1864.68s)]
*  What about the American families who don't want their loved ones who serve in our [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1865.76s)]
*  service to go fight another war overseas in the Middle East that he has no clear [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1868.92s)]
*  vision for? He talked about U.S. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1873.68s)]
*  boots on the ground. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1875.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a slap in the face to MAGA voters who specifically rejected the old [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1876.76s)]
*  neoconservative ideology. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1880.8400000000001s)]
*  He sounds like Liz Cheney. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1882.56s)]
*  But this is exactly what Russia and China have been saying. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1883.6399999999999s)]
*  It's all about the land. And basically, nobody watched what the Chinese said tonight. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1887.2s)]
*  They said, we know exactly what they want. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1891.56s)]
*  The Americans Gaza outside the Gaza Shores, they discovered oil and gas. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1893.6399999999999s)]
*  So it's not only this isn't a new this isn't a new concept. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1898.16s)]
*  I mean, in March, one second, it's about colonial day. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1903.0s)]
*  He proposed a new vision for America and its colonialism. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1905.92s)]
*  And he's been proposing this for other areas, Panama and other places. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1909.3999999999999s)]
*  But tonight he went further. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1913.1599999999999s)]
*  He said, Palestinians, we will send them left and right, whatever. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1914.52s)]
*  And Palestinians, by the way, the millions of Palestinians, they have families in the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1918.36s)]
*  West Bank, they have families in Jerusalem. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1921.6799999999998s)]
*  I have families in Gaza and I my family lives both in Haifa, in Jaffa and in the [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1924.0s)]
*  West Bank. We can move them there. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1929.6399999999999s)]
*  Why not allow the women and children to move actually to where they have relatives? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1931.56s)]
*  Why not allow the orphans? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1935.84s)]
*  There's thirty eight thousand orphans in Gaza. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1937.44s)]
*  We have orphanage that are empty in Jerusalem, in the West Bank, in Ramallah, in [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1940.0s)]
*  Chile and elsewhere. But you see that the vision is actually bypassing the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1944.56s)]
*  Palestinians and ethnically. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1948.88s)]
*  But I reject one portion of your statement, which is to say that there was a new [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1950.44s)]
*  vision of colonialism for the United States of America. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1954.0800000000002s)]
*  That I think that is as old as the United States of America. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1956.3600000000001s)]
*  That's not necessarily. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1959.28s)]
*  Yeah, we would never do such a thing. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1960.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1962.68s)]
*  But what is making is right. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1964.44s)]
*  No, but I'm also just doing right now that is about. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1966.32s)]
*  It's really it's a funny predicament for a lot of liberals who see their primary responsibility [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1970.68s)]
*  as defending Israel. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1977.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, simultaneously, Trump gives the game away. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1980.52s)]
*  So it's a it's a moment of divergence where on the one hand, you want to aesthetically [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1983.24s)]
*  maintain this presence that you are a progressive person that you care about, like [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1989.32s)]
*  international rules and laws and whatnot. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1993.48s)]
*  But on the other hand, Donald Trump is advocating for the cause overall, the cause that you [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=1996.1200000000001s)]
*  have also been tasked with defending. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2002.56s)]
*  He didn't deny it. He justified it by saying there's a precedent of colonialism. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2004.64s)]
*  Oh, he said American colonialism is as old as America that I misunderstand it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2008.28s)]
*  Oh, my bad. My mistake, Bakari. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2012.52s)]
*  I misunderstood. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2015.04s)]
*  I thought he was saying it's not a new vision as in like. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2016.24s)]
*  Like it's not a thing that exists. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2020.04s)]
*  I thought it was in defense. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2022.84s)]
*  Libs didn't agree with international rules. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2024.9199999999998s)]
*  They rejected the ICC warrants and even threatened the ICC. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2026.4399999999998s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2028.4399999999998s)]
*  I thought he said it in defense, like claiming that it's not a concept, like it's not new [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2029.4399999999998s)]
*  because it's not a concept. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2035.84s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2037.3999999999999s)]
*  No question. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2039.9599999999998s)]
*  But I mean, this is something can be a liberal and support Zionism. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2040.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2043.24s)]
*  Liberal Zionists exist. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2044.24s)]
*  There are plenty liberal Zionists. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2045.24s)]
*  Now, Zionism is, you know, a fascist ideology inherently because it's built around the continued [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2048.6s)]
*  domination of the out group at the behest of the in group that is considered, you know, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2055.72s)]
*  an ethnic and religious superior group. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2062.4s)]
*  So it's not really different than Nazi ideology in that same vein. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2067.2799999999997s)]
*  And yes, there are certainly there are certainly liberal Zionists who make there are certainly [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2073.7599999999998s)]
*  liberal Zionists that refuse to recognize these contradictions and will say, no, no, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2080.2s)]
*  no, you don't understand. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2085.6s)]
*  We just want Israel to exist. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2086.6s)]
*  Sixty seven boundaries while also simultaneously, you know, sometimes argue against settlement [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2088.2799999999997s)]
*  expansion in the West Bank. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2099.7599999999998s)]
*  And in other instances, just kind of let it happen. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2101.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, that is the distinction. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2103.2s)]
*  Ultra Zionists, rabid settlers. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2105.04s)]
*  They are the pioneers. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2108.4399999999996s)]
*  They are the first line of defense. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2112.68s)]
*  They will enact the agenda through and through Felix responded to my Supreme Court is going [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2114.4199999999996s)]

*  Didn't assume once again, my Sue 30 SM I'm coming to pick you guys up. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2123.9599999999996s)]
*  No one's going to crash into us as long as I have my R 27s and our 73s. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2126.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2131.04s)]
*  Felix is going to save me when push comes to shove and contradictions reach a boiling [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2132.04s)]
*  point. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2135.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2136.44s)]
*  Liberals that actually cave and capitulate and concede to fascists are still doing the [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2138.44s)]
*  bidding of fascist liberal Zionists. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2144.66s)]
*  And this stage in Israel are doing exactly that. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2147.44s)]
*  It is no different than Nazi Germany in that regard, where you did have plenty of liberals [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2151.72s)]
*  who initially were against the Nazi Party that inevitably made way for the Nazi Party. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2158.14s)]
*  They too were complicit in the actions of the Nazi Party. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2165.9s)]

*  I sometimes like using examples. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2179.14s)]
*  Even if I'm talking about Palestine, I like using examples that are not about Palestine [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2182.54s)]

*  Democrats cave and capitulate to the right on. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2219.0s)]
*  This is precisely the reason why I regularly talked about immigration, undocumented immigration [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2221.92s)]
*  in this country, and the Democratic Party's apprehension towards presenting a counter [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2227.4s)]

*  What do you expect from Israel to do when hundreds of innocent civilians get kidnapped [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2243.64s)]
*  and killed in their homes? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2246.7599999999998s)]
*  Keyloff, what do you expect Palestinians to do when hundreds of thousands, almost a million [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2248.52s)]
*  Palestinians were forcibly removed from their homes 76 years ago? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2254.8399999999997s)]
*  And throughout that 76 year process, Palestinians have been consistently dominated and murdered [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2259.72s)]
*  and also kept as hostages in permanent detention after military tribunals and sham trials. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2264.72s)]
*  That are all against international rights. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2270.68s)]

*  Because if your answer is, well, the only solution after October 7 is like ethnic cleansing, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2279.8399999999997s)]

*  How was that Israel's fault? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2289.3399999999997s)]
*  What is the nation state that settled on Palestinian land and did all of those things that I was [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2290.8399999999997s)]

*  That's it. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2304.96s)]
*  The standard of violence is always set by the colonial entity. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2305.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2310.44s)]
*  Israel is a settlement. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2311.44s)]
*  Israel is a settler colonial project that was designed around the forcible displacement [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2315.08s)]

*  One of the comments on Fox News today was that for the people who had ever wondered [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  what they would do during the Trail of Tears, the relocation of Asian population on the [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2369.7999999999997s)]

*  history books and they fantasize about how they would be on the right side of history. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2381.2799999999997s)]
*  And while that history is unfolding in front of their eyes, they are demonstrably on the [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2387.52s)]
*  wrong side of it. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2391.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2392.96s)]
*  Not recognizing that the exact same history is playing itself out in nearly identical [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2393.96s)]
*  fashion right now. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2399.84s)]

*  What they do in this moment is exactly what they would do back then. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2404.96s)]
*  That's that simple. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2408.04s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2409.12s)]

*  in the chat, defending the integrity of the democratic party at a time when it is at its [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2430.84s)]
*  lowest point in popularity for understandable reasons. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2436.7s)]
*  One of which is that the very same democratic party that he's vociferously defending does [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2441.2s)]

*  Donald Trump would not have become president. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2470.7999999999997s)]

*  Sure. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2474.48s)]
*  That Donald Trump is a fascist. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2475.48s)]
*  People who defend the democratic party right now are like Dallas Maverick fans. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2477.0s)]
*  Even after this recent disastrous trade. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2482.4s)]
*  And I don't even think there are any Dallas Maverick fans remaining that still defend [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2485.36s)]
*  this trade. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2489.34s)]

*  that does not care about them. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2498.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2500.32s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2501.32s)]
*  If you're still looking at the Luca trade and thinking, no, there's reason here. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2502.64s)]
*  You don't understand. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2508.04s)]
*  It's actually it, you know, Miriam Adelson does not want to secretly tank the team and [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2509.74s)]
*  then move it to Vegas. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2515.54s)]

*  Anthony Davis is going to be tremendously better, much better than a 25 year old Luca [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2530.0s)]

*  I know Anthony Davis is also injury prone. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2560.92s)]
*  He's also older and he's a great player himself. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2563.1600000000003s)]

*  That's understandable, but he is a point savant. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=2602.2s)]

*  it's a literal sequence of events that they believe will unfold. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3060.5s)]
*  Absolutely it is. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3066.1s)]

*  to the land. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3075.56s)]
*  And that's a good thing, and most evangelicals will say that this is a big sign pointing [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3077.56s)]
*  to how imminent the return of Christ may be. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3083.04s)]

*  Absolutely. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3090.84s)]

*  Yeah, even the MAGA hat. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3241.32s)]
*  So you spend a lot of time out there. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3242.72s)]
*  I've been in the States I think in the past year around 15 times. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3244.52s)]
*  Evangelical Christians have been appointed to some high-profile positions within the [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3249.6s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3253.8s)]
*  How important do you think those figures and their views will be? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3255.12s)]
*  They believe that this is the biblical homeland of the Jewish people, so definitely I expect [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3259.12s)]

*  They are tribal society. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3300.56s)]

*  in apartheid South Africa, where the term apartheid was first utilized as a legal terminology [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3314.0s)]
*  in the prosecution of it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3320.24s)]
*  That's what he's saying, while also simultaneously saying they're like tribal people. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3322.72s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3326.3599999999997s)]
*  They only have to accept one principle, that this area is a Jewish state. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3328.8799999999997s)]

*  to include some commitment to creating a Palestinian state. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3348.76s)]
*  On the ground, Israeli settlers are already making that next to impossible. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3354.0s)]
*  Governments have been expanding settlements here, the way they've been expanding their [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3360.1200000000003s)]
*  overall control of the occupied West Bank. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3363.96s)]
*  Many describe Israel as already de facto annexing the territory. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3366.84s)]
*  We've come to the village of Tur Mosaiya. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3373.36s)]
*  Most of these plush homes have been built by Palestinian American dual nationals, but [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3376.64s)]
*  with violence flaring, the area is now on the front. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3383.52s)]
*  Random question, but was the US, the segregation is US technically an apartheid structure? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3386.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3390.8399999999997s)]
*  The Jim Crow, Jim Crow initiatives were, yes, absolutely similar to an apartheid structure. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3391.8399999999997s)]
*  The difference is of course, it predates the actual legal designation of an apartheid. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3399.72s)]
*  That's the only thing that I guess salvages the, yeah, the salvage is the American reputation. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3405.2s)]
*  Well that and also whitewashing of American history. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3411.24s)]
*  And nine of attacks by extremist Israeli settlers. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3414.3199999999997s)]
*  They just want to drive people out from this area. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3419.2799999999997s)]
*  So they want to empty it completely from people so they can take it over. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3423.12s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3428.64s)]
*  We're back here from California after retiring as a lawyer and is now Tur Mosaiya's spokesman. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3430.12s)]
*  One of the things the Israeli right wing are lobbying for is... [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3436.56s)]
*  It's not like Palestine? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3439.72s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3440.72s)]

*  Is that something you worry Trump could accept? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3451.04s)]
*  We worry that he might agree and he might do that step which is a very, very dangerous [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3455.1s)]
*  step for us Palestinians. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3461.18s)]
*  It takes away the hope that we have been living for which is an independent Palestinian state. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3463.74s)]
*  Annexation of the West Bank means we're done. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3472.02s)]
*  On the horizon, an ancient biblical site and ever expanding Israeli settlements. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3476.1s)]
*  Now a new chapter in this old conflict could be about to begin. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3484.02s)]
*  The latest on President Trump. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1kTqJgL_k&t=3489.46s)]
