*  Yeah. If you don't remember nine 11, this is not for you. Okay. If you were born after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=0.0s)]
*  the towers fell, this is not for you. Do you understand this would have dropped approximately [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  around five years after the towers dropped and it would have dropped so goddamn hard. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=12.34s)]
*  I'm telling you. Okay. Listen to me. Listen to me. This song is an absolute banger. Okay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=18.48s)]
*  I don't care what anybody says. This is this literally this song. If this song was released [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=29.72s)]
*  20 years ago, this would be the best song. This would be the song of the summer. It'd [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=37.56s)]
*  be the song of the winter. Okay. As someone who's over the age of 30, when I heard it, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=42.44s)]
*  I was like, Oh my God, this is amazing. It's not even bad. Like it's not bad. The part [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=47.92s)]
*  that I hear the corner. Listen, this would have been on every corner. And I heard that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=56.4s)]
*  she won a show. Me who she be. I'm kind of waiting. Show me some more. This is Teddy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=68.48s)]
*  here to talk to give a story. You want to tweak it over me and I'm gonna show you how [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  they go like the money in my pocket. Blow the convos about me. Be closer. Niggas don't [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=78.52s)]
*  know. Tell me what they talking about. I ain't listening. Let's go. The rest of it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=84.36s)]
*  is all right. But from the South, but kick it with my Memphis twin. I can't take a loss. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=89.28s)]
*  I'm always going for the win. I've been geeked up in this booth. I got my blood pack for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=95.28s)]
*  the starter. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=99.44s)]
*  Don't be at the new day. Put some holes up through your body. I'm like, Oh, this is cool. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=100.44s)]
*  Let them in. If they should walk, this is as Lamar, bro. I'm telling you right now, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=104.44s)]

*  30 hears this very differently than every single person under the age of 30. Okay. This [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6KjQqg8fY0&t=132.26s)]
