# Trump’s Shifting Statements On Gaza Is ‘Kaleidoscopic Diplomacy’ | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU)
*  That's it. So at this stage, if you're looking at lesser evil harm reduction arguments around [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=0.0s)]
*  what's more harmful, you know, mass, a mass ethnic displacement campaign, forcibly moving [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=7.36s)]
*  Palestinians out of their ancestral lands, or what's worse, death and destruction and a mass [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=18.0s)]
*  campaign that destroys all structures that are standing in Gaza. That is an insane conversation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=24.16s)]
*  to be having. Okay. It's like Jordan to make preparations to do mass ethnic displacement of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=31.04s)]
*  Palestinians. Just so you know, before all of the liberals that freak out and say, oh, well, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=44.16s)]
*  Trump is doing this, Trump is doing this, like, what now? Yeah, this is something that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=51.12s)]
*  apparently the Biden administration also quietly pushed for as well. The difference between Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=58.0s)]
*  and Biden, on the other hand, is that Trump says the quiet part out loud, he takes the maximalist [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=65.44s)]
*  position openly. Okay, whether it will actually happen is an entirely separate conversation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=69.92s)]
*  I mean, this is something that even Benjamin Netanyahu, unironically, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=77.6s)]
*  actively praised. Benjamin Netanyahu actively praised this when he said, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=82.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is so good because he says things others are too afraid to say. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=86.48s)]
*  This is also something that, you know, this is make no mistake. This is a logical extension of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=91.2s)]
*  the past 16 months under the Biden administration, where there was so much death and destruction. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=98.56s)]
*  When Donald Trump says, when Donald Trump says, oh, Gaza is filled to the brim with rubble, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=104.96s)]
*  we have to clear it out and rebuild. Who actually destroyed Gaza? Israel did. Who actually allowed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  Israel to destroy Gaza? Biden did. Okay. That didn't happen as a natural disaster. So just [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  remember that when I say, when I say there is no indication, for example, that the previous [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=127.92s)]
*  administration or even Kamala Harris would be that much different, even though, yes, history has shown [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=135.52s)]
*  that while foreign policy is uniparty, the only difference is that the Trump administration or [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=142.0s)]
*  Republicans will oftentimes extend and take it even further, right? And then Democrats refuse to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=147.44s)]
*  fix it. Okay. This is what I mean. The diplomat said, here it is. Egypt rejected similar proposals [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=152.64s)]
*  from the Biden administration and European countries early in the war, which was sparked [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=159.92s)]
*  by Hamas October 7th, 2023 attack in the Southern Israel. The earlier proposals were broached [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=164.32s)]
*  privately while Trump announced his plan at a White House press conference alongside Israeli [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=169.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Do you understand? So it's interesting hearing from, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=172.56s)]
*  it's interesting hearing from people that European leaders, for example, that actively [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=178.56s)]
*  defended the Biden administration, that actively defended Israel's death and destruction in Gaza, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=185.68s)]
*  only now to turn around and say, oh, Trump is saying the final solution is he's advocating [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=193.52s)]
*  for ethnic cleansing. That's unacceptable. We cannot do mass displacement. That is a violation [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  of international humanitarian laws. Like, yeah. So 16 months of unlimited side wasn't [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=201.76s)]
*  a violation. It's only a violation now that Trump is saying it. That's it. That's the major [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=209.92s)]
*  difference. Democrats try to manufacture consent surrounding the issues that they advocate for. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=214.72s)]
*  Even if they fail, they still try to do it. And they try to do destabilization in a more [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=219.76s)]
*  covert fashion. Republicans, especially nowadays, Republicans, especially nowadays, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=226.4s)]
*  do not care about being covert. They will do it openly. They will celebrate the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Through Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani is due to meet with US Middle East [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=239.44s)]
*  envoys. What exactly is your point though? The Democrats are not in power. Biden is not the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=244.24s)]
*  president. He was not even running by the time the election happened. So like, what is your point? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=247.76s)]
*  I get it. It was bad, but you're doing like nothing to help anything. Wait, what? No, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=251.12s)]
*  this is simply addressing something that's very important that people have to contend with, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=256.96s)]
*  because a lot of liberals think that this is not a uniparty process, especially foreign policy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=262.24s)]
*  And they think like, oh, what now pro-Palestine protesters? Like, you did this. This is what you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=270.72s)]
*  wanted when most of the pro-Palestinian advocacy came from the understandable fears they had [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=277.84s)]
*  towards a Trump administration, moving the needle even further in terms of death and destruction, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  and therefore urging the Biden administration and the Kamala Harris campaign to take a strong [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  stance against Israel to stop the bleeding. Okay, that's it. So at this stage, if you're looking at [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=298.88s)]
*  lesser evil harm reduction arguments around what's more harmful, you know, mass, a mass [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=307.04s)]
*  ethnic displacement campaign forcibly moving Palestinians out of their ancestral lands, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=316.24s)]
*  or what's worse, death and destruction and a mass campaign that destroys all structures that are [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=323.44s)]
*  in Gaza, that is an insane conversation to be having. Okay, we've already completely lost the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=330.96s)]
*  plot. If that is the boundaries, that's the moral conundrum that we have in front of us, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=337.44s)]
*  that that is what we're arguing on behalf of. Steve Woodcoff in Florida later on Thursday, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=341.67999999999995s)]
*  the meeting comes ahead of the next exchange of Israeli captors for Palestinian prisoners [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=347.44s)]
*  as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal, which is expected on Saturday. Let's take this on with [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  Rami Khoury, who's a distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut joins [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=357.52s)]
*  us now from Boston in the United States, in fact. So Rami, first up, what's your sense of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=362.4s)]
*  this conversation that's going to be had between the Qatari Prime Minister and Steve Woodcoff? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  It would be interesting to be a flower on the wall in the light of what President Trump has been saying. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=372.96s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. It's a critical relationship Qatar has proved to be with Egypt, essential [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=379.12s)]
*  to get the process moving to the point where we are now starting the second phase of the negotiations, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=386.72s)]
*  which would ultimately get the Israelis out of Gaza, all hostages and prisoners released, and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=395.12s)]
*  the end of the war. So the problem is that the Qatari position is clear, the Egyptian position [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=402.24s)]
*  is clear, the Hamas position is quite clear, but the Israeli position and the American position [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=409.68s)]
*  are like a kaleidoscope. They keep moving around and new ideas are presented. There are huge [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=416.48s)]
*  internal debates within Israel that keep throwing obstacles into the way of the process. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  Netanyahu's legal fate is on the line. He may go to—he has to go to court, he may go to jail. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=431.76s)]
*  So there are lots of moving parts that are not clear what the implications are, and the latest [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=438.64000000000004s)]
*  is of course Trump's proposal to get the Palestinians out of Gaza, which already is being [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=445.92s)]
*  walked back by his senior officials, his foreign minister, his Middle East envoy, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  his press secretary. They're all kind of walking back saying, oh, this is temporary. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=456.72s)]
*  Not by him, because he doesn't really have a clear idea of what he's talking about. He's a showman. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=461.92s)]
*  He does drama, he does disruption, and he does disillusion, and he's really a delusion. He's [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=469.2s)]
*  really done all of these in this proposal. It's kind of make-believe. It's not going to work. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=477.28s)]
*  Very few people in the world want it. Most people have—governments have opposed it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=482.32s)]
*  So what he says gets the process, gets the discussion moving. The real question that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=487.36s)]
*  nobody has answered yet, lots of speculation, both here in the U.S. and in the Middle East, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=492.88s)]
*  is what is his ultimate aim? Most people, I feel from my discussions and following this, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=498.48s)]
*  most people tend to feel that what he's trying to do is put out an outrageous—put out there an [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=505.12s)]
*  outrageous proposition that he knows is not feasible, but he wants it to soften the Saudi [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  position on normalization with Israel. This is the big prize that the U.S. under Biden and now [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=516.96s)]
*  under Trump that they've always looked for. They want to get Saudi Arabia and Israel to have normal [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=522.64s)]
*  diplomatic relations, feeling that this would open the door to all the other Arab countries [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=529.52s)]
*  following suit. The Saudis have actually taken a harder line position after the Trump proposal. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  These are incredibly important discussions. They're going to focus narrowly on the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=542.72s)]
*  the discussions in Florida today. They're going to focus on the negotiations to release the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=547.44s)]
*  hostages and the Palestinian prisoners. Indeed. And are you on that? Are you—and the cease-firing [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  general—are you fearful now, given what's being said by— [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=558.16s)]
*  Dude, I need to say this with a new camera set up and set looks insanely good. Thank you. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=562.72s)]
*  Weren't you just talking about how you have backup generators? Yeah, but they're currently not [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=567.36s)]
*  connected, ironically enough, because of the previous issue that happened. So you expect to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=570.8s)]
*  get culture shock when you go to another country that you haven't been in before or for a while, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=577.28s)]
*  less so you come home? Yeah. All right. You're doing everything you can. It's okay. Yeah. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  Where were we? Where did we leave off? Like here, I think. What the hell? There it is. Okay. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=586.24s)]
*  Battery backup plus solar is go to, by the way. Yeah, I know. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=592.16s)]
*  You know, there's lots of speculation, both here in the US and in the Middle East. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=595.2s)]
*  As well, what is his ultimate aim? Most people I feel from my discussions and following— [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  Investing in UPS is a battery backup? Oh, dude, no way. I didn't realize. Thank you. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=606.24s)]
*  Dog, I have two generators and a UPS. Okay. I have it. The problem is that I was knocked off [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=611.6s)]
*  of it this morning. So I had to literally turn around and jerry-rig a contraption, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=623.2s)]
*  a separate power source while my actual—onk, you're just not tech savvy? Y'all are fucking [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=631.2s)]
*  stupid. Okay. This is one of the areas where I am tech savvy. God damn it, dude. Don't piss me off [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=637.2s)]
*  on this. No, I literally do have two generators and also a backup battery as well. The issue, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=643.12s)]
*  on the other hand, right now is that they have no juice. So they're currently charging, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=650.96s)]
*  and I had to jerry-rig a separate outlet off of the generators. Anyway, let's continue. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=656.8s)]
*  Most people tend to feel that what he's trying to do is put out an outrageous—put [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=664.56s)]
*  out there an outrageous proposition that he knows is not feasible, but he wants it to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=669.76s)]
*  soften the Saudi position on normalization with Israel. This is the big prize that the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=675.36s)]
*  U.S. under Biden and now under Trump that they've always looked for. They want to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=680.48s)]
*  get Saudi Arabia and Israel to have normal diplomatic relations, feeling that this would [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=686.4s)]
*  open the door to all the other Arab countries following suit. And the Saudis have actually [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=692.16s)]
*  taken a harder line position after the Trump proposal. They have these 300 AH [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=698.08s)]
*  LiPo batteries. You can chain twice. I have industrial-grade battery generators. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=702.72s)]
*  So these are incredibly important discussions. They're going to focus narrowly on the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=708.64s)]
*  discussions in Florida today. They're going to focus on the negotiations to release the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=714.88s)]
*  hostages and the Palestinian prisoners. Indeed. And are you on that? Are you—and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=719.84s)]
*  the ceasefire in general—are you fearful now, given what's being said by the president about the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=724.8s)]
*  efficacy, the solidity of the ceasefire deal as a whole? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=731.6s)]
*  No, I don't put a lot of emphasis on what Trump says. He says all kinds of things. He changes his [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=735.04s)]
*  mind. He clarifies. He denies. So he's not a reliable source, as the news businesspeople say, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=745.92s)]
*  though he is president of the United States. So what he says has to be considered seriously, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=755.36s)]
*  but it should not be taken as a clear path towards a policy. It has other motives—some business, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  some personal, some family relationships, some investment opportunities, and then cajoling [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=771.76s)]
*  people on both sides, pressuring people. So it's a fascinating study and sort of kaleidoscopic [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=779.52s)]
*  diplomacy. You know, kaleidoscope, when you turn it, all the pieces move and then a new [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=786.56s)]
*  situation comes about. So I think we have to let the process play itself out, focus on the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=791.2s)]
*  negotiations, the second phase that's supposed to start. Everybody, and I mean everybody, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=798.96s)]
*  wants the Israeli hostages released and the Palestinian prisoners released, and the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=805.2s)]
*  ceasefire to be permanent and the Israelis to get out of Gaza. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay. And the exchange is due again for this weekend, isn't it? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  You could argue, perhaps, finally, Rami, you could argue perhaps that in a way he's made the world [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  more aware of what Israel has done in Gaza. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=826.24s)]
*  Oh, absolutely, including American officials going to visit. And I'm hoping the media, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=831.2800000000001s)]
*  the global media, will be able to go soon, even though many of them, including Zazira and others, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=837.52s)]
*  have Gazan journalists who are sending out reports. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  So, yes, and this is what the Israelis desperately want to stop. They want to stop two things. They [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=846.4s)]
*  want to stop the world seeing what Israel does militarily and, you know, with prisoners and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=854.88s)]
*  all the terrible things it does. And that's why it's so widely discussed now in terms of both [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=861.6s)]
*  apartheid and genocide. And it wants to stop any discussion of the historical background to the [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  situation in Gaza, the Palestine-Zionism conflict, the Arab-Israeli conflict. It wants desperately to [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=874.08s)]
*  prevent any historical analysis. And it's increasingly unsuccessful in doing that because [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=881.6s)]
*  more and more people are going to the Middle East, to the West Bank, what's going on. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=888.8s)]
*  Therefore, the trend for the Israelis is not good. They've lost their ability to completely [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=894.16s)]
*  dominate the narrative of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian people in the West, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=900.48s)]
*  in the media and in officialdom. So it's quite extraordinary. I'm reading now the book, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=905.76s)]
*  amazing book by Elan Papay, the Israeli historian, on the history of Zionist lobbying in the West, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=911.04s)]
*  in England and the U.S. It's a 450-page monster, but it is the most amazing analysis based on [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=917.52s)]
*  total historical factual truths about how Israel has succeeded in doing what it's done, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=924.64s)]
*  which is create a Jewish majority state in a Palestinian land that in 1920 was 93% Arab, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=930.64s)]
*  including my family in Gaza. So this is what they're trying to prevent the Israelis, any discussion [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=937.44s)]
*  of this. And they're slowly losing control of this narrative. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=944.0s)]
*  All right. Rami, thanks for that. Rami Khoury, speaking to us there from the United States, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  from Boston. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQLiunLfvU&t=953.28s)]
