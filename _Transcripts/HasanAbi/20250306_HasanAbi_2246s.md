# Trump Is Constantly Changing His Policies | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw)
*  We're allowed to know I think every we just you know what's gonna fix the housing market situation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=6.72s)]
*  50 he's like he's killing he wants to kill the treat the rights like he's punishing the American working class [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=11.52s)]
*  I would like I would entertain [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=18.52s)]
*  Who has the who has the link to the live feed for Trump Trump is speaking Trump is speaking my goat is speaking [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=28.52s)]
*  It's time to listen to my goat. It's time to hear out my goat. Where is he? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=35.0s)]
*  Where is he being unhinged? I need to hear him [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=40.4s)]
*  Restoration and I think we'll do even better now, but this is something that we have to do [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=43.74s)]
*  There'll always be a little short-term interruption. I don't think it's gonna be big but [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=54.660000000000004s)]
*  Countries and companies that have been ripping us [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=56.660000000000004s)]
*  Aren't particularly happy with what I'm doing, but the United States will be very happy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=59.7s)]
*  And you know our farmers are gonna be very happy and again, they'll be just are they I don't think so in the end [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=64.12s)]
*  I said it before with China we signed an unbelievable deal with China 50 billion dollars in purchases and we're doing great [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  Biden however when he came in he never [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=76.98s)]
*  They never enforced that deal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=79.9s)]
*  so [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=82.3s)]
*  So that's the only thing that basically you have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=83.78s)]
*  Globalist companies that have been ripping us off that won't be able to rip us off globalist companies [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=86.9s)]
*  I think that's what the big charge is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=91.94s)]
*  You've been influenced some of these exemptions that have been announced and in some of these temporary delays [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  Have you been influenced in those decisions because of the market reaction? Well, there are no delays at all [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  No, nothing to do with the market [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=104.08s)]
*  I'm not even looking at the market because long term the United States will be very strong with what's happening here [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=105.74s)]
*  now these are [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=111.82s)]
*  countries and companies foreign companies that have been ripping us off and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=113.22s)]
*  No president did anything about it until I came along and then I did a lot about it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=117.69999999999999s)]
*  You know we took it out of China [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=121.98s)]
*  600 billion dollars nobody else took in ten cents from China [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=125.06s)]
*  They never did but when Kovac came along we had a focus on Kovac. We did a great job [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=128.78s)]
*  We got rid of that we ended up handing over with a market that was higher than it was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=133.7s)]
*  previous to Kovac coming in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=139.18s)]
*  But this is very much about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=141.54s)]
*  Companies and countries that have ripped off this country our country our beloved USA [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=144.7s)]
*  And they're not going to be ripping us off anymore. So, you know, I think that has an impact on the market [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=152.1s)]
*  Sir, this is a ease that's been prepared by the presidential personnel office [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=157.34s)]
*  It includes a number of sub cabinet level appointments a number of your ambassadors that have been previously announced and also crucially given the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=160.98s)]
*  Administration's a concerted effort to focus on violent crime [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=168.9s)]
*  It includes a number of US attorneys in major cities that have real crime problems. Okay, so very good people, too [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=172.26s)]
*  Thank you, sir, and then we have a number of ceremonial proclamations that Lindsay Halligan is going to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=179.34s)]
*  So two very special proclamations the first of which is a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=185.9s)]
*  Proclamation that proclaims March 2025 as women's history month in honor of all the wonderful women in your administration [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=190.7s)]
*  all the wonderful women in America and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=198.22s)]
*  in in honor of everything you've done for women and this administration has done for women and just [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=201.26s)]
*  For women in just what a month and a half. Yeah, we've done a lot and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=207.17999999999998s)]
*  Women have done a lot for us [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=212.82s)]
*  We have a women [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=217.66s)]
*  Thank you very much, mr. President, but thanks for all that you're doing for women [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  Interview I'll be later. Maybe I shouldn't do this interview. I should be like Biden not doing the interviews [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=227.54s)]
*  Yeah, my goat my goat is talking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  Go on pull up. That's great women. We love you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=236.1s)]
*  So the second one is a proclamation [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=248.7s)]
*  proclaiming March 2025 as Irish American Heritage Month in honor of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=252.14s)]
*  commemorate [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=258.74s)]
*  Between America and Ireland and to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=261.06s)]
*  Let's hope that there is no [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=264.9s)]
*  Americans and I'm a little bit biased because I'm [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=267.86s)]
*  Great people who is this part? What is he? What is she saying? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=273.7s)]
*  And they voted for me at heavy numbers so I like them even [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=279.53999999999996s)]
*  You have to like it, you know, you're not supposed to but you have to like that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=282.98s)]
*  He's he's signature is awesome though. I will say he has so much fun with it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  He has so much fun with it and I do like his signature to be fair [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=291.54s)]
*  I'm boy Steve Wittkopf told us a little while ago that if a mass does not release hostages that the US and Israel could take [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=295.66s)]
*  Some action. What does that mean in your eyes? Is that military action? Would you join strikes with it? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna find out I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  had the honor of spending a lot of time yesterday with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=310.38s)]
*  Quite a few of the people that we got out and I can't believe how badly treated they were really bad [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=315.18s)]
*  stories that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=322.38s)]
*  You wouldn't even believe [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  Some of it was documented some of it was so bad. You couldn't really I don't think you can put it on [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=325.3s)]
*  And it's a shame and and they said one thing that they have 59 hostages of which many of them are killed [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=331.14000000000004s)]
*  They want to know if we could just [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=339.66s)]
*  continue [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=343.3s)]
*  They said without us look Biden wasn't able to get anybody out. We came along and they started releasing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=344.62s)]
*  but we have 59 left of which 24 are living the rest are are dead and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=351.90000000000003s)]
*  We put out a statement. It's sort of self-explanatory. I think but yeah, it's always self-explanatory [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  Have to get a lot belligerent man [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=365.06s)]
*  Yeah, when he when he says stuff like I'm gonna pummel Gaza into the ground you'll see [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=374.1s)]
*  Yeah, just you wait, you know, I'm always [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=379.7s)]
*  I'm always thinking like what does he mean by this? What does he mean when he says like I'm gonna [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=382.74s)]
*  I'm gonna show you what's what? Yeah, it's wiggle room. Is the mic still messed up? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=387.58s)]
*  No, is Mike messed up? No, it's speak for a second. Hello. Hello [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=393.06s)]
*  Is it still messed up [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=398.02s)]
*  No, yes. No, yes. Yes. No. Yes. No, it's fine. Is it peaking sounds good? It has a buzz [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=400.46s)]
*  I don't know why it's got ring in it. I don't know what it what that's about [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=409.3s)]
*  honestly [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=414.94s)]
*  it might be the XLR cable, but [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=416.02s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of those given the green one [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=421.74s)]
*  No, I don't want to give him the green one because we're gonna have a third person in here in a little bit [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=424.1s)]
*  So we're gonna have to use three Mike's crazy things that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=428.14s)]
*  You know, you can see it happening. It shouldn't happen, but you can see it happening. You see a lot of it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=431.42s)]
*  I don't know how to fix it [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=435.7s)]
*  For today I want the cabinet members to keep good people. I don't want to see a big cut where a lot of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=438.9s)]
*  People and the people that aren't doing a good job that are unreliable don't show up to work and such those people can be cut [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=449.3s)]
*  I have unplugged it and we plug it didn't work [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=455.94s)]
*  And I said I want the cabinet members go first keep all the people you want everybody that you need [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=458.26s)]
*  And it would be better if they were there for two years instead of two weeks because in two years [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=464.58s)]
*  They'll know the people better, but I want them to do the best job. They can where we have good people [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=470.09999999999997s)]
*  Those that's precious. It's very important. We want them to keep the good people and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  So we're gonna be Elon and the group are gonna be watching them and if they can cut it's better [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=480.94s)]
*  And if they don't cut then Elon will do the cutting [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=486.38s)]
*  People saying that it's still buzzing it's currently not buzzing [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=489.26s)]
*  I can look at the audio levels here. It only buzzes when he speaks [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=493.58s)]
*  So what are you guys lying and saying it's buzzing right now [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=497.58s)]
*  If there's buzzing noise is coming from the video that you're watching not from the mic people that might be buzzing separately [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=500.94s)]
*  It would be really funny if it's just the buzzing from the video [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=507.42s)]
*  No, I mean, I'm sure I'm sure there's like an issue with the XLR cable because it's not the first time this happened [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=511.42s)]
*  But it's annoying that they're like no Elon has been [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=516.46s)]
*  Really teaching everybody about [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=520.94s)]
*  The numbers that you can do but what I want is I want the numbers [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=523.5s)]
*  But I also want to keep the good people we want to get rid of the people that aren't working that aren't showing up [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=526.5s)]
*  And have a lot of problems and so they're working together with Elon someone like me know it's talking so I can see for myself [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=531.9000000000001s)]
*  How bad it is for the sake of our country [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=539.46s)]
*  You can't do it for the sake of our country. You can't do it for the sake of our country [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=541.94s)]
*  One of the moments where it was buzzing and so I can check it out before [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=546.94s)]
*  Okay, this is what it sounds like. I love doing I love doing this [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=552.0400000000001s)]
*  Is the mic still messed up? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=556.5400000000001s)]
*  No, is Mike messed up? No one speak for a second. Hello. Hello [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=559.22s)]
*  Is it still messed up it's fine not yes, no, yes. Yes, it's like completely fine [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=564.1400000000001s)]
*  bro [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=572.34s)]
*  It's like okay all of you are no your dogs. No your dogs. You're literally dogs [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=573.66s)]
*  No, there there is there is a high there is a very very high frequency [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=579.94s)]
*  buzzing that happens [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=585.74s)]
*  There is a very high frequency buzz that happens for sure. I hear it as well [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=587.42s)]
*  but if you are if you are [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=591.34s)]

*  Well, France is also willing to put soldiers into Ukraine for safety reasons if we can get it [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=988.64s)]
*  I will say that we've made a lot of progress with Ukraine and a lot of progress with Russia over the last couple of days [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=993.96s)]
*  And it'd be great to bring that to an end so we don't have to talk that way [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1001.5200000000001s)]

*  Which didn't make it easy was a total hoax the total rigged hoax by some bad people [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1032.76s)]
*  Despite that I was very close to having a [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1038.12s)]
*  Program with Russia a de-nuclearization and we're gonna get China [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1041.1599999999999s)]

*  but [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1049.72s)]
*  Bad things happened like an election that was rigged [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1052.0s)]
*  Happened and so we had to come back four years later [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1055.32s)]
*  But I would very much like to start those talks the opposite of what you say the de-nuclearization would be incredible [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1058.76s)]
*  You were talking about I know yesterday you spoke with the big three did you tell them that no more [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1068.0s)]

*  So how did you come to the decision to send somebody from your team to negotiate with Hamas? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1117.4399999999998s)]
*  We are having discussions with Hamas [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1123.4799999999998s)]
*  We are helping Israel in those discussions because we're talking about that's not true [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1126.8s)]
*  Israeli house negotiate with terrorists and that's that's like literally a thing [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1132.12s)]
*  They're not doing anything in terms of that's not real [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1135.84s)]
*  I should when I give you know, I don't know who asked that question [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1138.68s)]
*  But I want to shake his hand. I got 59 hostages out and we gave nothing in 59. We gave nothing [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1141.56s)]
*  So they're also what's going on with the most like universe? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1148.6s)]
*  I mean I consider that something where we're helping Israel for the most part we had a couple of [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1151.56s)]
*  We got a couple of American hostages [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1157.8s)]
*  But certainly Peter, you know, I do you have to negotiate Nick there's a difference between negotiating and in paying [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1162.9199999999998s)]
*  We want to get these people out if you would have seen the people yesterday, maybe you did [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1171.48s)]
*  I don't know but if you would have seen them the way they spoke about their captivity [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1175.58s)]
*  It was unbelievable [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1179.76s)]
*  Well, I've said that to them I said if you're not gonna pay we're not gonna defend I said that [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1192.3600000000001s)]

*  I said if you're not gonna pay your bills, we're not going to defend you and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1202.0800000000002s)]
*  It also went for the attack, but if they got attacked they said well does that mean you won't defend us [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1206.96s)]
*  I said, are you current or you're delinquent? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1212.16s)]
*  They said if we were delinquent would you I said, nope, I would not and because of that as you know [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1215.48s)]

*  I said I should wait till my second meeting and I did and I brought that up and I said if you don't pay your bills [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1241.32s)]
*  We're not gonna participate. We're not gonna protect you and [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1247.52s)]

*  and it's directly going to worsen this problem by [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1923.1s)]
*  creating this [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1927.38s)]
*  ginormous gap that already exists between those who have the money to be able to go to a private education of [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1928.78s)]
*  And get a private education those who are lucky enough to be able to get vouchers to go to private school and [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1933.74s)]
*  And those who just get no education whatsoever going forward. These guys will not stop until [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1939.02s)]
*  Basically everyone is homeschooled. Okay, which probably will lower school shootings at least or maybe [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1945.7s)]
*  Localize the school shootings, you know [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1953.02s)]

*  Out of Gaza, I [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1974.42s)]
*  Think that Gaza is a mess and I think that Gaza could be good [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1976.78s)]
*  I think it's got to be run properly [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1981.3s)]
*  But right now Gaza is an absolute mess and it has been for many many years and decades. Yep [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1984.3s)]
*  More of a mess in the last year and a half. Yeah, just me [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=1991.54s)]

*  Know everything about it. I said we have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2002.54s)]
*  I said do me a favor. Can you get him out? He said yes, he is preparing to go up. I think in two weeks [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2008.5s)]
*  It's crazy that they already have an existing [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2016.98s)]
*  They already have an existing rocket that they can take back down [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2021.34s)]
*  I can't tell you that but it's been delayed a bunch of times because [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2023.94s)]
*  The government did not want to take a risk like NASA didn't want to take a risk Boeing didn't want to take a risk [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2028.66s)]
*  So they delayed it right now, but the rocket is still up there [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2033.38s)]
*  They can still use that and they were planning to and Trump is now using this as an opportunity to give you on a W [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2036.14s)]
*  We're coming up to get you and you shouldn't have been up there so long [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2041.7s)]
*  the most incompetent president in our history has allowed that to happen to you and [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2045.3s)]
*  But this president won't let it happen. We're gonna get them out. We're coming up to get you. I've authorized Elon [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2051.06s)]
*  I said, can you get them out? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2057.06s)]
*  Bro if I'm an astronaut trying to stay the fuck away from America not gonna lie [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2068.42s)]
*  I'm trying to stay up there at the ISS for as long as I can. Okay [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2072.34s)]
*  It can have [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2081.7s)]
*  Some failures up there. That would be very bad. You got to get them out. So I've was I've authorized Elon [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2083.18s)]
*  a week ago I said, you know, we have two people up there that Biden and [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2089.7s)]
*  Kamala left up there China can't even get them because the ISS does not cooperate with the Chinese [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2094.42s)]
*  That's why they have to they have to go [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2101.62s)]
*  But then take the opportunity [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2107.86s)]
*  When we sent measuring candidate [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2111.98s)]
*  Explained on the blowback podcast as the first time that the concept of brainwashing was ever used in an American newspaper [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2118.22s)]
*  Fantastic treatment that the the People's Liberation Army showed the the American captives [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2130.54s)]
*  That caused the Americans to claim that these American captives were defecting [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2138.38s)]
*  Yeah, I get that right it was that and the germ warfare thing [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2143.86s)]
*  Yeah, because well the movie is about like it's like a defection thing [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2146.88s)]
*  But in real life it was like like wow these flyers like these American pilots are all saying these [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2150.2200000000003s)]
*  biological germ bombs and they sound really [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2155.54s)]
*  Uncoached and like they're speaking honestly about it must be brainwashing. Yeah, speaking of which, you know who else did that? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2158.7400000000002s)]
*  Yesterday our favorite itamar bangavir who said that about an Israeli captive that had returned to Israel [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2165.66s)]
*  And he said his statement resembled [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2172.98s)]
*  Hamas [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2176.2999999999997s)]

*  I want to see what he said the the captive said that caused bangavir to say that [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  What is this? No Hassan you look like someone who has sexual intercourse with dead goats. I mean your mom is the goat of [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wab6mDdNLDw&t=2207.08s)]
