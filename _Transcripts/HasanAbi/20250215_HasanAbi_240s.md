# Hasan's Valentine's Date | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M)
*  But he still maintains the position that he didn't realize that it was Valentine's Day to call a first date, which I think is ridiculous. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=0.0s)]
*  So, into the broadcast last night, it was Valentine's Day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=16.8s)]
*  And of course, I did the time honored tradition of engaging in a Palentine's date. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=20.8s)]
*  And it was a lot of fun. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=27.28s)]
*  Had a lot of fun. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  I went out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  I went out with some friends. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=30.52s)]
*  Now, initially, I went out with my trainer and we were supposed to go out with another friend as well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=31.96s)]
*  But he had actually scheduled a date, a first date with a girl on Valentine's Day, which is crazy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=38.4s)]
*  That's a crazy thing to do. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=45.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=47.68s)]
*  And it turns out it was so crazy that it was actually not slated to happen. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  And he hit me up as we were driving around town, trying to actually find a place where we can eat because everything was slammed to the gills because everyone was on dates of their own. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=54.52s)]
*  My friend texted me and he was like, yo, by the way, what are you doing? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=68.2s)]
*  And I was like, wait a minute, I thought you're supposed to be on a date. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  What the hell's going on? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=73.84s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, yeah, she said she came down with something. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=74.72s)]
*  And I was like, oh, yeah, dude, you got, you know, you got rejected. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=79.92s)]
*  But he still maintains the position that he didn't realize that it was Valentine's Day to call a first date, which I think is ridiculous. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  I believe him. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=97.2s)]
*  But it is ridiculous that he just didn't realize that he was asking for a first date on Valentine's Day with a girl that he's never met before. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=99.12s)]
*  I love this left this community because as soon as I said she called in, she called it out because she was not feeling good. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  And immediately people like bird flu, monkeypox, avian virus. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  It's all going around right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=117.24s)]
*  It's like, bro, calm down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  All right, calm down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=119.96s)]
*  Like, it's not it's a normal social. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  It's a normal thing that people do when they're socializing, when they don't when they think that there's too much pressure potentially to go on a date with someone as their first date on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=124.6s)]
*  Valentine's Day because they feel like it's maybe something that they signed off or that they don't consider to be a good thing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=134.84s)]
*  Maybe they consider the stakes are higher. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=142.84s)]
*  OK, it's called lying. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=145.04s)]
*  People do it all the time anyway. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=146.0s)]
*  But regardless, we went out. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=147.72s)]
*  We went out to dinner, Valentine's dinner, three men, three handsome men. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=152.08s)]
*  And these girls, they saw my two buddies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=159.28s)]
*  I had my back turned to the restaurant because I don't like to tactically sit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=164.0s)]
*  I don't really care to show how sigma I am to assert my dominance. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=169.32s)]
*  I turn my back to the entire restaurant. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=173.32s)]
*  And these girls like we're sending notes on a handkerchief, on napkins to our table. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=175.4s)]
*  So then when you yucked it up, which I thought was kind of funny, it was a little it was a cute moment, you know, on Valentine's. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=183.36s)]
*  I do not know where everyone else's stories ended on that night, but predictably my story ended with me leaving early to go to sleep [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=190.6s)]
*  because I was far too tired. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=202.08s)]
*  Come 11, I I why didn't you stream yesterday? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=205.04s)]
*  I did. I was live yesterday for eight hours. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=210.64s)]
*  Even by accident, you on the stream, that makes no sense. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=214.88s)]
*  Yeah, I went to I went to bed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=218.56s)]
*  I went to bed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=221.2s)]
*  I would say not not early. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  You're not old, but spiritually you are ancient dog. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  OK, dude, let me tell you something. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  It's hard. It's hard to be me. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=231.32s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSV_Ov4X0M&t=233.32s)]
