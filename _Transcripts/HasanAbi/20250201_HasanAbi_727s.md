*  Can you stop doing this? It's very uncomfortable every time the camera pants to them. There's a reason for it [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=23.34s)]
*  Okay, because everyone around you thinks you're fucking crazy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=28.62s)]
*  And then I and but Ethan has [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=37.42s)]
*  Caffeine Oh just watch the video and take some accountability. Don't be a pirate software, dude, dude [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  It's an hour and 40 minute video. Okay. Can I just say something? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=47.82s)]
*  This is genuinely is to my come across a little ableist [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=51.58s)]
*  But you literally have an intellectual disability if you think that like I am fearful of watching an hour and 40 minute video made [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=54.54s)]
*  By a dude who literally thought Roe v. Wade was the gay one last week. Okay [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=61.5s)]
*  like when every single child or [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=68.18s)]
*  Someone with an actual child brain a person who literally was a yang ganger. Okay, someone who was in support of yang gang [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  Who genuinely does not know anything about politics. What am I supposed to watch every fucking crash out? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=80.16s)]
*  You think like every single time some and slop tuber makes a video. This is actually incredibly important points [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=86.64s)]
*  The only thing you're demonstrating is your own [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=93.26s)]
*  Okay, it's an hour and 40 minutes of a sex pests cults communities [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=95.76s)]
*  Compiled garbage that he took a week off to literally shave off the in serial numbers off of basically [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=102.84s)]
*  Just so that there wasn't that stink associated with it because unfortunately for him his favorite content creator was outed as a fucking sex pest [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=110.96s)]
*  for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=118.24s)]
*  Consensually and unconsensually recording people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=119.32s)]
*  While they're having sex and then distributing it to a bunch of other 19 year old [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=122.48s)]
*  Discord e-girl kittens that he wanted to fuck [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=127.76s)]
*  Okay, and then all of those videos were leaked a month ago including [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=130.55999999999997s)]
*  Videos of him having sex with his ex-wife who I know for a fact she has mentioned [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  Did not give him consent to release those videos the random people and the idea that this is a deflection is fucking monic [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=140.88s)]
*  Because I have mentioned [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=147.92s)]
*  Every single stupid fucking point brought up a million times over the reason why chatters are gonna bring it up non-stop [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=149.95999999999998s)]

*  Okay [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=213.3s)]

*  Selfish way to approach that conversation from the personal feelings of a rich [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=256.82s)]
*  100 millionaire sitting in his Bel Air mansion talking about his own goddamn feelings [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=261.9s)]

*  You're clearly not [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=552.72s)]
*  Intellectually equipped enough and you got diluted by a sex cult [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=554.64s)]
*  Okay, like destiny was able to brainwash you over the course of a year. I'm sorry [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=558.8s)]

*  You know do your little right wing tilt I guess and then maybe you can find admiration again [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=584.36s)]
*  But it's probably not gonna happen in the liberal sphere that you're trying to carve out for yourself. I'm sorry [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=589.84s)]
*  Liberals and I disagree with a lot of liberals. Okay, but many liberals are still [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=596.16s)]
*  infinitely more intelligent than the fucking average dumbass right winger [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=604.52s)]
*  They get manipulated by right wingers a lot, which is why I get very mad. Okay [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  But it's much harder for you to cultivate a fan base with your unfortunate [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=614.52s)]
*  Lack of knowledge over politics in that sphere. Okay, just become a right winger then you know, look at Tim pool [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=619.6s)]
*  You have massive audience. Anyway, I've been so nice dude, and I you know what the most annoying part is for a year [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBq9qVMvR28&t=627.72s)]
