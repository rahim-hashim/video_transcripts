# Raging Wildfires In Los Angeles | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo)
*  Why didn't you evacuate your quintillion dollar house? Because my quintillion dollar house has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=0.0s)]
*  a moat with crocodiles that actually have been genetically modified to fight fires. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=6.0s)]
*  Specifically, they're genetically modified in two directions. One, to kill people that are poor. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Okay. You might never know. You know, your entire city could potentially be on fire [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=19.6s)]
*  in a moment's notice. All right. So folks, this is part of the broadcast where I tell you about [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=29.84s)]
*  my personal news about what's going on. Folks, this is part of the broadcast where I tell you [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=34.64s)]
*  about my personal news about what's going on in the world of us on awesome. I would probably get [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=38.64s)]
*  in between the time period where I press the stop streaming button and press the start streaming [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=41.44s)]
*  a button. And let me tell you, let me tell you, my King, are you okay? No, I am not. Okay. I have [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  a headache. I have a weird taste in my mouth, but that is entirely my fault. Just say you hate me [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=52.0s)]
*  instead of playing anything by immediate, but is no, it's just the best. That's the best song ever. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=58.96s)]
*  Okay. So, so there's a lot to talk about today. There's a lot going on in the world of a song, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=63.84s)]
*  Hassan Abi piker. There's a lot going on in my backyard, literally and figuratively. And we'll [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=69.52s)]
*  get to all of that, of course, but aside from all of the madness and chaos, as far as personal news [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=74.56s)]
*  goes, what have I done last night? I threw on the extended edition of Lord of the Rings, the two [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=81.28s)]
*  towers. Okay. Lord of the Rings, the two towers. What did you do with Kyle? Why did you replace her [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=91.36s)]
*  with the fire extinguisher? I liked it. You are so primed in on fire and whatnot that you just noticed [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  that there's a fire extinguisher there. That's been there forever. I've always had that there, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=102.32s)]
*  but yeah, extended edition, extended cut directors cut. It's like only four hours long. It's not that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  big of a deal, you know, so whatever I'm making my mom watch it, it's pretty sick. Yeah. Lord of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  Rings, the twin towers, nine 11 also cheers. I'm unrelated to nine 11. I'm just, you know, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=118.08s)]
*  is Kyle okay? I think so anyway. So where was I? Yeah. I was watching that went to bed, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=125.28s)]
*  uh, woke up at, well, didn't immediately go to bed, went to bed thinking, Oh my God, maybe this stuff [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=134.56s)]
*  is, you know, maybe this stuff's getting a lot worse. This whole, uh, fire situation. And it did, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=141.52s)]
*  uh, my grandmother evacuated my cousin's school completely burned down. Um, but luckily there [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=149.2s)]
*  weren't there. Obviously, uh, my grandmother, my grandmother and grandfather had to evacuate. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=154.8s)]
*  Hopefully jank won't have to evacuate. Like they evacuated over to, uh, Jenks, shaky, shaky, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=159.92s)]
*  Gerga. Um, but, uh, outside of that, um, I think my mom's probably going to come here and stay with [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=166.64s)]
*  me as well. Palisades charter, uh, Pam Pacific or not Pam Pacific, uh, Pacific Palisades. Yeah. So [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=174.16s)]
*  you're right. I think it's the Palisades one. I don't know. It's one of the, the Palisades school [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  is lit on fire. Also. Oh my God. I think my mom is trying to get into the house and having a hard [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=185.36s)]
*  time doing that right now. Like literally speak of the devil. Don't you dare. How are you doing? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=193.28s)]
*  Is your window open? No, it's not. It's okay. All right. Um, why didn't you evacuate your [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=200.24s)]
*  quintillion dollar house? Because my quintillion dollar house has, uh, a, uh, a moat with, uh, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  crocodiles that actually have been genetically modified. The fight fires specifically, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=213.2s)]
*  they're genetically modified in two directions. One to people that are poor. Okay. That's number [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=218.88s)]
*  one. Obviously, first and foremost, they have, uh, they have machine strapped to their backs [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  and the machine automatically recognize, uh, you know, they, the, the machine gun have a targeting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=231.28s)]
*  system that shows how much money the person has made. Right. So if you're, you know, it shows how [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=237.68s)]
*  much money you have in your 401, uh, 401k. Uh, so yeah, on top of that though, these are very specific [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=244.4s)]
*  alligators that also know how to combat fires. So the machine double as water cannons as well. So [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=251.84s)]
*  I'm, I'm pretty set. It's a rough space. Had to evacuate from Alta Dana. Lots of my neighbors [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=257.68s)]
*  finding out their house are gone. Yeah. It's, it's pretty, all jokes aside, it is insane. It is very, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=262.72s)]
*  very devastating, but, uh, luckily everyone's safe. Uh, apparently so far only two people have passed [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=269.04s)]
*  away in the process, but thousands of buildings are now gone. Just completely gone. Um, I do also [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=275.04s)]
*  have an Australian sprinkler system on my roof. So misogynist variant alligators. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  Of course. So you just said they were crocodiles. Now they're alligators. I have both. I have both [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=290.16s)]
*  in order to have, uh, in order to get like, cause crocodiles are better at fighting fires. Alligators [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=295.92s)]
*  are better at fighting the poor. So I have both, but they're both equally adept at, you know, doing, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  uh, at least like, you know, a decent amount of fighting the poor and also the fires. So anyway, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=309.04s)]
*  we've got a lot of wildfire coverage that we're going to get into. But, uh, as I was saying, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  I did do one thing this morning. I posted a TikTok of my experience. Okay. And let me tell you, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=319.6s)]
*  okay. I just, something stupid. Here it is. What's up everybody. Uh, welcome to hell world, the hell [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  that is a sunny Los Angeles, California, uh, wildfires are happening right now. It's pretty [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  crazy. Uh, Palisades on fire, Malibu's on fire. I'm in West Hollywood, so it's not as bad, which [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=338.56s)]
*  means that we are not in a mandatory level three evacuation zone or even a level two evacuation [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=344.16s)]
*  zone. For the record, I wanted to specify that because I know a lot of people are going to be [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  coming in here today, yelling at me because they're going to be like, why haven't you evacuated? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=355.12s)]
*  And there is no reason to do that. If you are not in an evacuation zone, where would I go? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, so the millennial pause, I thought I cut all of the millennial pauses out, but I guess I do [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  have it. Even though everything is orange, it's very dune like. And this morning I had the brilliant [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=373.68s)]
*  idea of going out to play basketball and also take Kaia to the park because I needed. This is the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=378.96s)]
*  Joel Brandon helicopters that flew over by the way, this morning to, you know, get a little bit of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=384.64s)]
*  a lift in cause the gym was obviously closed. And now I feel like that maybe wasn't the best idea [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=389.52s)]
*  because I have, I feel like I inhaled a lot of, uh, coal. That's what it feels like to me right now. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=394.0s)]
*  Also a quick shout out to Karen Bass for cutting the fire department spending by [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  $20 million in this past year and increasing the police department spending instead. Now, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  obviously it's a tiny minuscule percentage of the overall budget, but you know, it's good to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=411.44s)]
*  set our priorities straight. So yeah, that's what I did. I recorded a TikTok, but yeah, I bro, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=415.52s)]
*  why would you do that? Cause I'm stupid. The guy that you get your news from is a stupid guy. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  And I don't know how to explain that to you. They didn't that one right wing grifter guys say, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=430.0s)]
*  smoke isn't harmful. Dude, are you going outside into smoky air without a mask? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=434.56s)]
*  It's not even necessarily going outside. I think people just don't really understand the scale of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=439.04s)]
*  LA as a city. Yeah. It depends on where the smoke is being, where the smoke is being pushed to. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=442.88s)]
*  Okay. And I, it was dumb. Okay. What are these zoomers talking about? What is a millennial pause? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=449.12s)]
*  I feel attacked is when you, when you, when you first start recording, there's like one pause in [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=456.32s)]
*  the beginning. You're in Marri, Marijuana, Fornia, and you probably will get secondhand high just [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=462.24s)]
*  from being outside. So be careful. You may have filled a drug test. You're the only, the only time [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=467.36s)]
*  you'll see right wingers fighting for a mass law. No, I think right wingers don't even want to wear [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=471.04s)]
*  a mask in the smoke because they're stupid. Smoke inhalation is dangerous. Air quality is over 300. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=474.48s)]
*  Wear a mask. I don't know where to find the, I don't know where to find the air quality [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=479.92s)]
*  information. Is it on the weather app? Like, can I find it on the weather app? I know what's our [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=485.28s)]
*  air quality looking like? Good. Check your weather app on your phone. She hasn't checked it either. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=490.0s)]
*  All right. Severe weather, high wind. Ooh, it says hazardous. Okay. So I, I should have, is this color [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=494.96s)]
*  of incredibly dark past the point of purple maroon indicative of the danger of inhaling this weather? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=504.64s)]
*  Yeah. It says 347. So what do you do in that situation? That seems bad. Okay. Well, I went out, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=513.36s)]
*  I went out and guess what? Guess what, brother? You know what I did? Okay. You know what I did? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=521.28s)]
*  Okay. Hold on. You know? Yeah. I went out, dude. I went out. I went out and I play basketball. Why? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=526.24s)]
*  Why? Because God damn it. I'm an American. Okay. I'm a goddamn American. That's why I went out. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=532.88s)]
*  Without a mask. Okay. I went outside and I went out without a mask to make my goddamn lungs stronger. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=540.96s)]
*  Why'd you stop? Yeah. I, I, I went outside cause the smoke is fake. Okay. It's the smart dust. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=553.12s)]
*  It's actually the reverse of the smart dust. Let me tell you, this is the reverse of the smart [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=559.2s)]
*  does. This is the type of dust you want to, this is the type of does you want to inhale rather than [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=563.92s)]
*  the fog, which you shouldn't want to inhale because the fog is trying, the government is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=568.64s)]
*  trying to make you gay with the fog, but this, but the, but the black fog, AKA what libtards [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=574.0s)]
*  are calling smoke. That's a good thing to inhale. Okay. So the people are calling it smoke, smoke vid. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=579.76s)]
*  I've never seen the AQI bar extend that far. Holy shit. That's bad. Yeah. I'll tell you this much. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=586.96s)]
*  I have a headache and also there was definitely a bad taste in my mouth. So probably not the best [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=593.68s)]
*  idea to go outside right now. So, you know, just learn from my mistakes, learn from my mistakes. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=602.4s)]
*  That tastes is literally cancer. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah. The air quality index is looking not too [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  good. Damn. You dumb as hell, bro. I am. I'm not a very smart guy. What is this? Breathable saw does. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=614.56s)]
*  Who says you shouldn't be saw those breathe right out of the bag. Vitamin medley trusted by [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=620.88s)]
*  thousands of doctors over 36, more vitamins to enhance your endocrine and mental strength. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=625.92s)]
*  I agree. It feels good as hell for your lungs. I think, but I learned my lesson and I learned [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=630.88s)]
*  my lesson the hard way. Okay. So that's the situation that we're at anyway. Aside from that, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=638.8s)]
*  it seems like things are not going too well anywhere around the world, but especially not [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=645.76s)]
*  in California. We're going to get to it. Okay. What is this? Insightful and thought provoking. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=649.68s)]
*  Oh no, this one is so stupid. This is my, this is also an incredibly stupid moment for me. Whoa. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=655.28s)]
*  I got him on my other cell phone on speakerphone so he can describe. Whoa, look at the plane. From [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=662.4s)]
*  his perspective, he's been sending me. Dude, imagine you're a fish and you're chilling. All [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=666.7199999999999s)]

*  to evacuate to all I'm going to say is this, given the incredibly densely populated area of [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=817.52s)]
*  Los Angeles that I live in, if the flames actually got to the point, if the flames actually got to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  the point where it was anywhere near my domicile, we would have a Jai enormous problem that, that [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=831.04s)]
*  would mean the evacuation of damn near the entirety of Los Angeles. Like that is true, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=840.24s)]
*  complete bedlam. It's already there. It's already there. Basically for Santa Monica, it's, it's [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=846.88s)]
*  really scary for Santa Monica at this point. They have contained 0%. Yes. Because of the reason why [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=854.64s)]
*  they can't contain it is because the winds are 80 miles, sometimes a hundred miles and at night. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=861.92s)]
*  So they have to let it burn. There is nothing they can do. There's literally nothing they can [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=868.8s)]
*  do. The wind is just picking it up and moving it wherever it feels like. So the only thing [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=873.68s)]
*  that everyone can do in this, in this juncture at this stage is just hope that the winds don't blow [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=881.52s)]
*  in your direction. Adam on 96. Thank you for the five gift to subs. So that is, that is a serious, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEHFjKN_auo&t=889.52s)]
