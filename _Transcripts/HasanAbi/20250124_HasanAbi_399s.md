# Joe Rogan Claims He Is Not Affiliated With Any Political Side | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc)
*  Joe Rogan was this guy at a certain point. And I think like as, as late as like when [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=0.0s)]
*  he endorsed Bernie Sanders. So like even 2020, I would say he was still teetering on the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=6.2s)]
*  edges post COVID. Joe Rogan is not that guy. Okay. I think post post COVID Joe, dude, he [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=12.5s)]
*  said he liked Rhonda Santas. I'm not even talking about Trump. Okay. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=19.32s)]
*  I don't here. Let's let's talk about some other stuff while we wait for this. Here's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=25.12s)]
*  Joe Rogan and tribalism in politics posts. Once again, a brilliant take from Joe Rogan. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  Let's hear what Joe Rogan had to say. I love referring to my favorite apolitical content [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=42.68s)]
*  creator, Joe Rogan on issues that pertain to American politics sense to be on a team. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=46.96s)]
*  sense at all, even for someone like me, like, you know who, yeah, I went to the inauguration, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=52.52s)]
*  you know, I was, I was bizarre, but I don't consider myself a Republican. I don't consider [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=61.4s)]
*  myself a dog. I'm sorry, but at this stage, that's a wild thing to say. Like what more [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=68.0s)]
*  can you do? You voted for Donald Trump. You played a major role in boosting Donald Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=74.4s)]
*  You literally went to the Donald Trump inauguration. Donald Trump thanked you by name multiple [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=80.12s)]
*  times for his victory credited you with it. You also interviewed JD Vance and numerous [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  other Republican commentators. I cannot comprehend how like you endorsed him. I don't understand [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=92.5s)]
*  how you can still be like, Oh, it's just this politics stuff is not, you know, I'm just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=100.26s)]
*  a mere vessel, dude. Politics just goes through me. I'm a, I'm a porous hole. Basically that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  politics just kind of pushes through me. I, I love America. I'm not, this is not about [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=112.48s)]
*  left politics, right politics. It's about, you know, American politics. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=119.28s)]
*  I'm not a Democrat either. I consider myself an American. I just, I'm a human being and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=122.92s)]
*  there's a lot of things that the Democrats believe that I believe too. There's a lot [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=128.96s)]
*  of things that they say that I say that makes a lot of sense to me. And there's a lot of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=133.2s)]
*  things that the Republicans do. And the idea that I have to ignore things that make sense [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=136.96s)]
*  to me because it's coming from the wrong team is just stupid. And the idea, those like, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=141.56s)]
*  these are bad faith arguments where you have to have a conversation with someone and pretend [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=145.96s)]
*  that what they're saying is not logical because I think this is truly a dumb guy behavior, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  but you know, Joe Rogan does this best because they're supposed to be your opponent. That [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  to me is just dumb. It doesn't make any, that doesn't benefit me at all. It doesn't benefit [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  anybody listening at all. It's just stupid. It's a stupid way to think it's, it's so limiting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  and it's so bad for you cognitively. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=171.0s)]
*  Cause I think that there was a point when Joe Rogan was this guy. Hallelujah. Thank [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  you for saying it. Where have all the moderates gone? The largest political party in the U [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  S at the moment is no political party. These moderates are all around social media and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  don't show it. Joe Rogan was this guy at a certain point. And I think like as, as late [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=187.26s)]
*  as like when he endorsed Bernie Sanders. So like even 2020, I would say he was still teetering [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  on the edges post COVID. Joe Rogan is not that guy. Okay. I think post post COVID Joe, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=200.38s)]
*  dude, he said he liked Rhonda Santas. I'm not even talking about Trump. Okay. I don't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  care. Donald Trump is telegenic. I can totally understand why someone like Joe Rogan or [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=213.66s)]
*  many other dumb dudes will be like sucked into his allure, right? He is the hog whisperer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=219.82s)]
*  He communicates at a frequency that hogs tune into. All right. So even with Trump, I'm willing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=229.14s)]
*  to say, you know, maybe someone is somewhat apolitical, even though it's the second Trump [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=236.54s)]
*  term and it already happened after the first disastrous Trump term, even then I'm willing to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=241.54s)]
*  say if you are, you know, somewhat pro Trump or definitely pro Trump in the tank for pro Trump, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=248.54s)]
*  you can still maintain this like a veneer of, of being apolitical. But when you say you like Rhonda [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=254.14s)]
*  Santas, when you say you like Rhonda Santas, you are no different than Ben Shapiro. Okay. You are [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=263.66s)]
*  a complete political actor. Okay. That's it. Because Rhonda Santas is the reverse of Donald [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=272.3s)]
*  Trump in many ways. Okay. Rhonda Santas is the Elizabeth version, Elizabeth Warren version of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=282.5s)]
*  Donald Trump. Okay. He is a technocrat through and through utilizing, not just use a lot, utilizing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=292.18s)]
*  popular sentiment to make gains because he doesn't have the charisma to back it up anyway. Okay. But [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=300.62s)]
*  he actually is like invested in writing weird legislation that follows through. Like he thinks [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=307.38s)]
*  making gains in the legislative side to further the culture war agenda is actually going to give [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=315.66s)]
*  him a platform of prominence. And we saw how awful that was for him because of how unimaginably [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=321.94s)]
*  uncharismatic he is. So the way I see it is if you are the type of guy who says like, I really like [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=328.86s)]
*  Rhonda Santas to me, that's like, that's like being a Democrat and saying like, I really like [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=336.38s)]
*  Kamala Harris. You know what I mean? Oh, I'm apolitical, but I really like Kamala Harris. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=343.46s)]
*  Like explain to me exactly what you like about Kamala Harris as an apolitical person. No, you're, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=349.1s)]
*  you are a ride or die at that point. I thought that this was really funny. By the way, activists [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=355.94s)]
*  who projected this onto the Berlin gigafactory are charged with showing these symbols. Virtually [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=362.06s)]
*  every German outlet said virtually every German outlet said that what Elon did was not, but Hey, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  God forbid you post this. God forbid you project this on the side of one of his factories. I guess [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=372.3s)]
*  it because it says Hile too. Yeah. If it's not, when Elon is doing it, it's not considered a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=377.86s)]
*  slogan. After all the ADL said so, but when someone else posts it on the side of the factory, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=384.26s)]
*  then you know, that's, that's the slogan hearing. How dare you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4L8A80Mufc&t=389.22s)]
