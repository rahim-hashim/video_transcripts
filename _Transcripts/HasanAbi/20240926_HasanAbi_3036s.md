# Difficult Day For Trump At New York Rally | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0)
*  All they do when they do this, when the Democrats do this, by the way, is normalize right wing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=0.0s)]
*  sentiment. If you don't address some of the insane lies that Donald Trump is telling a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=5.32s)]
*  mile a fuck a minute, all you have done in that process is normalize these lies and you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=10.0s)]
*  have people on your side of the political spectrum. Believe it. Wonderful stuff. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=14.52s)]
*  Oh, Trump is coming in. Fast forward into the future. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=20.12s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  Years we have been living through the worst border crisis in the history of the world. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=30.16s)]
*  There's never been anything like it, which has brought untold suffering, misery and death [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=34.16s)]
*  upon our land. The architect of this destruction is Kamala. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=38.84s)]
*  When you look at the four years that have taken place, Kamala, after being named [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=44.4s)]
*  border czar, Kamala Harris will be visiting the southern border that she has [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=50.36s)]
*  completely destroyed from what I understand tomorrow. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=58.24s)]
*  Why would she go to the border now playing right into the hand of her opponent? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=61.96s)]
*  I mean, you take a look at this. Why would you do that? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=68.76s)]
*  There can be no justification for what she's done. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=71.16s)]
*  There's no body saying, oh, gee, she's done a fabulous job. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=73.88s)]
*  She's done the worst job probably in the history of any border, not just our border. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=78.12s)]
*  She keeps talking about how she supposedly wants to fix the border. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=82.08s)]
*  We would merely ask, why didn't she do it four years ago? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=86.8s)]
*  It's a very simple question. I could say this with everything she has. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=90.68s)]
*  She talks about borders and taxes and all these different things. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=94.24s)]
*  Her policies on tax, by the way, are terrible. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=99.36s)]
*  But I can say it for everything. Why didn't she fix it almost four years ago? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=101.6s)]
*  She's got no plans, got no talent, got no ability to do it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=108.0s)]
*  I'm here today to present you with the facts and only the facts about how [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=112.4s)]
*  Boring. Talk about Eric. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=117.16s)]
*  Comrade Kamala Harris [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=118.4s)]
*  Talk about Eric Adams [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=120.56s)]
*  Willfully threw open our border, helping to virtually destroy our country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=121.56s)]
*  Our country's never been under... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=126.76s)]
*  He's more winded than Sam Sulek doing bicep curls, bro. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=128.36s)]
*  What the... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=132.32s)]
*  Secure border in U.S. history. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=133.16s)]
*  Boo. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  With the lowest illegal immigration on record. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  You know the chart. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=140.0s)]
*  I love that chart. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  I love that chart. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=143.04s)]
*  I probably wouldn't be here right now except for that chart. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  Those who our borders were captured, detained and quickly sent back home [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  under the Trump administration. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  But on her first day in office, Kamala Harris terminated every single Trump [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=157.0s)]
*  policy that sealed and secured the border. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  She ordered an immediate stop to the completion of the border wall. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=165.32s)]
*  It was almost complete. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=170.16s)]
*  We built hundreds and hundreds of miles of wall and it worked. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=171.4s)]
*  I always said walls and wheels. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=175.84s)]
*  Everything else is obsolete, but walls and wheels and this wall worked and we [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=178.24s)]
*  were ready to build and throw up another 200 could have been done within weeks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Everything was complete. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=188.12s)]
*  The wall was all built, ready to go, laying there, ready to be fixed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=189.52s)]
*  Laying there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=194.6s)]
*  All they had to do is throw it up and you would have had an extra 200 miles of wall, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=195.8s)]
*  far more than I promised in the election. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  She suspended all deportations. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=204.72000000000003s)]
*  She instituted catch and release across the entire southern border. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=208.24s)]
*  And we had catch and release also, but we released in Mexico. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=213.08s)]
*  Her catch and release was to release in the United States and never see them again. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  She sent Congress a bill demanding amnesty for all illegal aliens, every [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=220.84s)]
*  single illegal alien, even if they're drug dealers. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=226.44000000000003s)]
*  Human traffickers. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=231.08s)]
*  She wanted amnesty for everybody. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=233.4s)]
*  Radical left. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  This is a radical left person. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  She terminated remain in Mexico, something that took me and a lot of talent, a lot [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  of other people, but it took a lot of talent to get from the president of Mexico. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  A good man, but we got it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  You had to remain in Mexico. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  You couldn't come in under any circumstance. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=254.0s)]
*  You weren't allowed into the United States until we checked it out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  And many people did not come in and were not allowed to come in because they [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=259.4s)]
*  didn't check out. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=264.08s)]
*  They were drug dealers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  They were gang members. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  They were in jail for a couple of cases. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=269.28s)]
*  We wouldn't let them in. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=272.0s)]
*  And she canceled every safe third agreement. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=273.2s)]
*  Anybody here, I think, would know what that is, but that was a horrible [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=277.32s)]
*  thing that she did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=280.4s)]
*  And she canceled remain in Mexico. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=281.52s)]
*  Here we have something remain in Mexico. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=283.84s)]
*  You don't have to explain it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=285.84s)]
*  She canceled. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=287.08s)]
*  She ordered ICE to halt the removal of virtually all aliens, including MS-13 gang [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=288.44s)]
*  members, the worst gang anywhere in the world, they say. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=295.2s)]
*  Evil, evil gang. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=300.04s)]
*  She ended all of our programs that we instituted to stop child and woman [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=301.76s)]
*  trafficking. The trafficking is at a level now that it's never been before. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  I had it down to the lowest level. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  It's been in 32 years because we had such a strong border. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=313.8s)]
*  They couldn't get through. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=317.64s)]
*  But now it's the worst it's been in 32 years plus. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  And then she lost. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=322.88s)]
*  And this is probably the worst statistic of them all. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=324.16s)]
*  Three hundred and twenty five thousand children. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=329.24s)]
*  Think of that three and a half years. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=334.16s)]
*  She lost three hundred and twenty five thousand children. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=336.24s)]
*  And they're either dead being sold into sex slavery or just plain missing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=339.04s)]
*  Think of the number three hundred and twenty five thousand. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=347.0s)]
*  If that were a Republican instead of her and she was the border czar, she says, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=349.64s)]
*  well, I wasn't the border czar. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=355.04s)]
*  She was. And tomorrow she'll make a case that, oh, she did a fairly good job. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=356.32s)]
*  You can't say much. You can't justify it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=361.24s)]
*  She should save her airfare. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=367.12s)]
*  He can do it with the signing of a of a just a signature and a piece of paper to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=371.36s)]
*  the Border Patrol. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=376.04s)]
*  Instead, she's going there to try and convince people that she wasn't as bad as [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=377.92s)]
*  everybody knows. She was she was the worst in history. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=381.72s)]
*  Grossly incompetent, weak and ineffective. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=384.48s)]
*  And all you have to do is ask Brandon Judd, Border Patrol. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=388.6s)]
*  You could ask any of them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=393.04s)]
*  Tom Homan. We had the best people that we've ever had. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=394.24s)]
*  And they said Trump was the best president on the border ever. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=397.88s)]
*  She ripped up every single reform that we put in place to stop asylum fraud. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  She ended a travel ban that was unbelievably successful. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  We had the strongest travel ban anywhere in the world and it was upheld by the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=411.2s)]
*  United States Supreme Court. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=415.76s)]
*  She canceled Title 42. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=418.16s)]
*  That was a medical title. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=421.76s)]
*  She canceled it very hard to get. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=423.56s)]
*  And altogether, she took 93 executive orders that I put on all which made the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=425.64s)]
*  border the best border we've ever had in recorded history. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=434.12s)]
*  And she terminated them along with Joe Biden, the worst administration in the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  history of our country. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=443.64s)]
*  And on the border, it's not even close because of these acts in less than four [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  years. 21 million illegal aliens at least. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=450.84s)]
*  That's the real number. You don't hear that year 15, 16. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  Sometimes you hear 17. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=457.88000000000005s)]
*  The number is at least 21 million. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=459.36s)]
*  And on top of that, you have got a ways. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=461.88000000000005s)]
*  That's got a ways. That's people that came over or got away. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=463.76000000000005s)]
*  And they've stormed across our border like nobody in history on any border [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=467.76000000000005s)]
*  anywhere in the world. There's never been any border in history where you had [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=472.68s)]
*  millions of people storming us like that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=476.56s)]
*  No third world country would allow it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  But she allowed it because she's incompetent. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=483.48s)]
*  She allowed it because she never went there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=485.84s)]
*  She says she went once, but it was not the right location. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=489.8s)]
*  It's a location that was very mild and no danger. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=492.44s)]
*  She never went there. She's going there tomorrow after almost four years. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=496.64s)]
*  She's going there tomorrow to try and show you what a great job she did. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=499.76s)]
*  But even now, the numbers are terrible. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=502.76s)]
*  And remember, they're flying people over and they haven't stopped that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=505.72s)]
*  They're flying hundreds of thousands of people over the border right now. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=510.0s)]
*  They never stopped that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=513.8399999999999s)]
*  They didn't think they'd be caught, but they were two weeks ago from prisons [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=515.04s)]
*  and jails, mental institutions and insane asylum. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  All these are sane asylums where you have the sickest people, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=523.6s)]
*  mentally ill people and terrorists at record levels. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  We've never had terrorists come into our country like this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=532.0s)]
*  They come and they keep coming and coming. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=535.24s)]
*  And nobody has ever seen anything like it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  People that go to the border, they look professionals and they said, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=541.52s)]
*  There's never been anything like this in the history of the world. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=545.16s)]
*  And that's throwing. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=548.04s)]
*  They are destroying the fabric of our country. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=549.3199999999999s)]
*  She did nothing to stop any of it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  In fact, she encouraged them to keep coming. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=554.24s)]
*  And you know that for years she did. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=558.92s)]
*  Only recently did she say, Oh, well, we're going to try and put a stop to it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=560.92s)]
*  She literally flew to Guatemala as like her first part of her [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=564.56s)]
*  vice presidential border czar duties and told them famously, do not come, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  including unrelated elements to what we're talking about now, like taxes, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=573.3599999999999s)]
*  like military, like so many other things. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=579.64s)]
*  Why didn't she do it? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  She's got plans for the future. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=584.28s)]
*  Why didn't she do it? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=585.8s)]
*  She's been there almost four years. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=586.64s)]
*  The state of Guatemala created a brand new program to fly in migrants from Venezuela, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=588.68s)]
*  Haiti and Nicaragua, and resettle them in American communities, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=596.12s)]
*  including small towns all across our nation, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  but in particular in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=606.88s)]
*  Nobody can believe it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=611.72s)]
*  These towns have been destroyed and the mayors of the towns [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=613.72s)]
*  and the governors of the states can't talk about it [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=616.84s)]
*  because they're embarrassed [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=619.2800000000001s)]
*  that they allowed it to happen. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=622.08s)]
*  In addition, through her phone app, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  something totally new now, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=626.7800000000001s)]
*  it's a phone app for migrants, where migrants call in. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=629.32s)]
*  Highly sophisticated migrants. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=633.96s)]
*  She's allowed virtually unlimited numbers of illegals [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=636.88s)]
*  to press a button, schedule their illegal immigration [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  appointment at our ports of entry [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=644.4s)]
*  and show up to be released into the interior of our country. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=647.04s)]
*  Can anybody believe this? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=652.9s)]
*  And they're invading our towns. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=654.48s)]
*  It's an invasion of our country [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=656.24s)]
*  like no country has ever had to suffer before. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=658.48s)]
*  And this was purposeful. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=662.42s)]
*  He's talking about the streamlined application [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  that doesn't even work appropriately. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=665.52s)]
*  A mistake on their part. They did this on purpose [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=667.72s)]
*  because their policies are so wrong and so evil [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=670.12s)]
*  and so unfair. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=673.7s)]
*  And there's only three reasons they'd want to do that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=675.1s)]
*  Number one, they're incompetent, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=678.34s)]
*  and I'm not sure that that's the reason. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=681.24s)]
*  Number two, they want it for the votes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=683.74s)]
*  Number three, you know what that one is. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=685.58s)]
*  We don't have to talk about that one. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=688.5200000000001s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=690.9200000000001s)]
*  But there can only be very few reasons. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=691.82s)]
*  Wait, what is that? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=694.32s)]
*  Because they're destroying our country [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=694.98s)]
*  at a level that's never been seen before. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=696.2800000000001s)]
*  Importantly, as part of this con job, it's a con job. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=699.0600000000001s)]
*  None of the illegal aliens, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=702.9399999999999s)]
*  she is smuggling in through the ports or on the airplanes. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=704.38s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  Big jet planes loaded up with migrants [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=709.88s)]
*  flying into the middle of our country [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  and going to Iowa and lots of other states. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=716.3s)]
*  They've all become border states. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=720.04s)]
*  We only have border states now, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=721.54s)]
*  but they're counted in the Border Patrol statistics. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  And when you do that, you can add a lot of numbers [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=727.8399999999999s)]
*  because they're not taking those counts. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=731.26s)]
*  They want to have those counts not included in the numbers. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=733.64s)]
*  In Aurora, Colorado, Springfield, Ohio, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=738.64s)]
*  where it's been a mass invasion, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=741.88s)]
*  these were two beautiful, successful towns, idyllic, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=744.28s)]
*  and they're in trouble, big trouble, and very unfair. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=749.82s)]
*  The people want to leave. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=752.86s)]
*  They want to get out. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=753.78s)]
*  But everyone's afraid to say, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=755.38s)]
*  I want to get out because they want to be politically correct. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=757.0600000000001s)]
*  And other towns just like them, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=760.4000000000001s)]
*  hundreds of them all over America, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=762.1400000000001s)]
*  Americans have watched their communities destroyed [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  by this sudden suffocating inundation of illegal aliens. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=769.12s)]
*  It's an invasion. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  This influx has overwhelmed our schools. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  They're taking the seats of students [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  that can no longer go there, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=784.3000000000001s)]
*  and they don't even speak English. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=785.7s)]
*  They're trying to fire a lot of people [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=787.5400000000001s)]
*  and hire interpreters. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=789.6999999999999s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=791.0999999999999s)]
*  They want to get rid of some people. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=792.64s)]
*  They want to hire. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=793.9s)]
*  Springfield is looking, the mayor said it the other day, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=794.7399999999999s)]
*  looking for interpreters because nobody in all of the 32,000 [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  people that took into the town, think of this, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=803.42s)]
*  you have a town of 50,000 people, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=806.66s)]
*  and almost instantly you have 32,000 people, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=809.9599999999999s)]
*  in this case, from Haiti. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=814.2199999999999s)]
*  Most of them don't speak English, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=816.0s)]
*  so they're looking for interpreters. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=817.3s)]
*  You have to get them out. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=819.18s)]
*  We have to save our country. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=820.28s)]
*  You have to save these towns. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=821.5799999999999s)]
*  They flooded the job market with low-wage migrants, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=823.7199999999999s)]
*  but many cases, migrants that also have horrible records, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=829.92s)]
*  drug dealing, so many different things, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  a lot of human traffickers, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=837.5s)]
*  and it's mostly human traffickers in women. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=839.4s)]
*  Last month, American-born workers lost 1.3. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=842.56s)]
*  I just want to point something here. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=847.16s)]
*  He's talking about migrants that are processed through TPS, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=849.66s)]
*  which means that they get their background checks. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  The application that he's talking about also [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=855.0999999999999s)]
*  is another part of this, and it's like literally customs [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  and border patrol processing these migrants, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=860.0s)]
*  so therefore everything he says about these people is wrong. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=862.28s)]
*  One, they are legal migrants. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=866.2199999999999s)]
*  He's complaining about legal migrants, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=868.62s)]
*  saying he wants to deport legal migrants. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=870.2199999999999s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=871.88s)]
*  Number two, he's lying and saying that they're actually [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=872.9s)]
*  They're not. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=876.5s)]
*  They literally cannot have a background for them [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=877.1s)]
*  to be able to get that TPS clearance. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=879.74s)]
*  Hispanic also, they're suffering, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=882.6s)]
*  and the families are suffering. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=885.34s)]
*  It also doesn't make any sense because they're stealing the jobs, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  but they're also somehow simultaneously [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=889.74s)]
*  still doing like drug dealing. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=891.68s)]
*  Like they're both dealing drugs and also stealing the jobs. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=893.34s)]
*  Last month, think of that, and now we've gained, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=896.52s)]
*  out of that number, 635,000 jobs, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=900.88s)]
*  but every single one of them was an illegal migrant. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=905.14s)]
*  They've also, as you know, and you've heard me talk about it, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=910.1800000000001s)]
*  just happened very recently, we found out, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=913.4200000000001s)]
*  818,000 jobs were fraud. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=916.08s)]
*  They fraudulently claimed that the economy picked up [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=919.88s)]
*  818,000 more jobs than they stated. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=924.12s)]
*  And a whistleblower or leaker, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=927.82s)]
*  let it be known that that was false, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=930.22s)]
*  that the 818,000 jobs was a false fraud. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=932.8s)]
*  It was a fraud. It should be investigated, by the way. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=939.66s)]
*  Biden knew about it, and Kamala knew about it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=942.6s)]
*  And they were going to release the real figures [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=946.34s)]
*  right after the election. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=948.38s)]
*  But by putting 818,000 phony, fake, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=949.88s)]
*  disgusting jobs that don't exist, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=953.72s)]
*  by putting them on the rolls, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  it made them look much better a short while ago. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=957.76s)]
*  But they didn't quite make it to past election days. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=961.36s)]
*  So to that whistleblower or leaker, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=965.32s)]
*  I want to, on behalf of the American public, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=967.66s)]
*  thank you very much. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=971.04s)]
*  These people are a fraud, just like nobody talks about it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=972.46s)]
*  But Kamala never had a job at McDonald's. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=976.1800000000001s)]
*  Her resume talks about McDonald's, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=978.64s)]
*  McDonald's, McDonald's. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=980.64s)]
*  When I worked at the French fry counter, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=982.78s)]
*  it was so tough, so hot. She didn't work there. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=985.54s)]
*  She never worked at McDonald's. It was a lie. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=988.08s)]
*  Most heartbreaking of all is Kamala's migrant invasion [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=990.28s)]
*  has brought massive into our country [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=994.56s)]
*  at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=997.3199999999999s)]
*  We've never seen levels like this. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=999.22s)]
*  And during the debate, I mentioned — [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1001.64s)]
*  Yeah, an unprecedented dropping. He's not wrong. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1003.1s)]
*  We've never seen it before. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  The dropping by unprecedented levels. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1006.9s)]
*  I think we did great. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  But David Muir of ABC — fake news — [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1010.74s)]
*  when I said that he was way up in our country, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1013.7s)]
*  he corrected me. He corrected me on so much. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1016.3199999999999s)]
*  And it was right, what I said. He didn't correct her one time. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1018.6999999999999s)]
*  And what she said was wrong. Absolutely wrong. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1021.6999999999999s)]
*  So many different — Charlottesville, she was wrong. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1025.28s)]
*  All of the different things. Almost everything she said. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1029.22s)]
*  And she was never corrected. But he corrected me. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1032.4199999999998s)]
*  And he said, no, no, has not gone up. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1036.28s)]
*  I said, has gone up massively. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  He said, I'd like to state for the record [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1040.12s)]
*  that has not gone up. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1043.02s)]
*  But it hasn't. It hasn't gone up. It's gone down. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1043.96s)]
*  And you see that there will be no corrections of any kind. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1046.1799999999998s)]
*  And they have the deal. Why? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1050.4599999999998s)]
*  Because they're bad people and they're fake news. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1052.06s)]
*  So he did it many times to me during the debate. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1055.2199999999998s)]
*  He had the deal. That's the deal. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1058.8s)]
*  Because you can take anything and — [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  It's wild. It's wild that they — [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1062.1399999999999s)]
*  This is just like a prominent fixture. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1064.1399999999999s)]
*  We had a deal where that wouldn't happen. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  You could do whatever you wanted [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1068.04s)]
*  as soon as the debate was over. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1069.3s)]
*  But he did it in total of what our agreement was. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1071.98s)]
*  A prominent fixture in the Republican arsenal [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1073.46s)]
*  of communications is basically just lying and lying [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1077.4s)]
*  and lying over and over again in the face of like abject truths. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1079.88s)]
*  And just like back in the day, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1084.68s)]
*  they at least used to try and say something [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1086.74s)]
*  like they would cherry pick data or they would lie by omission. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1090.48s)]
*  They would use like the normal ways in which you know, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1095.22s)]
*  you can lie but then have some level of plausible deniability. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1098.2600000000002s)]
*  Nowadays, they just openly are like, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1101.2600000000002s)]
*  Nah, they're eating cats and dogs. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1102.6599999999999s)]
*  Name is up. Shut the — [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1104.1799999999998s)]
*  They're now illegal aliens. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1105.1s)]
*  They've given you the fake stories [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1107.34s)]
*  that the illegals coming into the country [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1110.62s)]
*  are much better than our people. They don't commit — [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1113.7399999999998s)]
*  These are some of the worst anywhere in the world. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1116.86s)]
*  And they don't just come from South America. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1119.4599999999998s)]

*  The Congo in Africa — a lot of them coming from the Congo. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1123.7399999999998s)]
*  The Middle East. Asia. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1127.6799999999998s)]
*  They do come from South America, but not all. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1130.82s)]
*  They're coming from all over the world, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1133.58s)]
*  and they're emptying out their jails, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1135.06s)]
*  and they're emptying out their mental institutions. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1137.1399999999999s)]
*  The money they're saving is beyond belief [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1140.58s)]
*  in what they're doing to our country. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1144.46s)]
*  And if I were the president of one of those countries, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1146.86s)]
*  I'd be doing the same thing. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1148.98s)]
*  I'd say, Let's empty out our jails into the United States. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1150.4199999999998s)]

*  and it's going to stop starting on January 20th. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1156.5s)]
*  But the most important day in the history of our country [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1160.02s)]

*  Three months ago, in Queens, an illegal alien [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1167.8600000000001s)]
*  released into our country by Bordasar Harris [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  approached two 13-year-old children with a machete [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1174.18s)]
*  in broad daylight, forced them into the woods, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1178.74s)]
*  tied them together by the wrists, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1181.26s)]
*  and the young girl hurt the girls very, very badly. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1183.78s)]
*  They caught him because he put it on tape. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1187.86s)]
*  He put it on film. They caught him. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1190.8999999999999s)]
*  He thought it would be nice to have it on tape [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1193.98s)]
*  to show his friends. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1196.06s)]
*  In June, two NYPD officers were at point-blank range [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1197.78s)]

*  she threw herself out of the moving vehicle, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1341.14s)]

*  they didn't mean to me, they meant to me. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1347.98s)]
*  That was her statement. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1350.5800000000002s)]
*  Earlier this year, an illegal migrant from Haiti [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1351.9s)]
*  granted entry by Kamala and her horrible policies, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1355.22s)]

*  — I think it's pretty wild that, like, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1368.8600000000001s)]
*  there's a sum total of, like, 60-plus, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1370.78s)]
*  and total committed by undocumented migrants [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1374.54s)]
*  in this current fiscal year, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1377.6200000000001s)]
*  and Trump has mentioned approximately half of them [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1379.3s)]
*  in the process of his remarks. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1383.62s)]
*  Now, if the American government [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1386.06s)]
*  was not, like, actually actively targeting — [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1388.74s)]
*  whoever does, right, local municipalities, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1390.98s)]
*  police officers and whatnot — [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1392.98s)]
*  were not actively targeting these people that are doing [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1394.7s)]
*  and then arresting them, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1396.82s)]
*  you would maybe have an opportunity to say, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1398.42s)]
*  what the — is going on here, okay? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1401.22s)]
*  The issue, however, is that when you look at the actual reality, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1403.94s)]
*  when you look at the actual data, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1408.06s)]
*  and you find out that undocumented migrants — [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1409.8999999999999s)]
*  undocumented migrants are four times less likely to do property [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1413.78s)]
*  in comparison to natural-born US citizens [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1416.6999999999998s)]
*  or two and a half times less likely to do anything [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1419.58s)]

*  you realize that hyper-focusing on undocumented migrants [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1424.9799999999998s)]
*  in this way is simply to just make it seem [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1428.3s)]
*  as though every undocumented migrant is out there, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1430.6599999999999s)]
*  mentally ill, an escapee from an insane asylum, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1433.78s)]

*  That is what the actual problem here is, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1441.7800000000002s)]
*  when that is the opposite of the reality, okay? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1444.38s)]
*  And if there is no one that will speak truth to this insanity, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1448.38s)]
*  to these racial screeds that Donald Trump is routinely pumping, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1453.22s)]
*  then more Americans are going to believe it. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1458.14s)]

*  almost four years ago? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1463.74s)]
*  All of these things she could have done four years ago. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1466.1s)]
*  You will hear Kamala claim that the reason the border is not secure [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1471.06s)]
*  is that Congress has refused to pass her atrocious border bill. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1474.98s)]
*  It's the worst bill you've ever seen. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1479.42s)]
*  It would allow people to come in here at levels [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1481.18s)]
*  that would be incredible and would allow them to get citizenship. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1484.26s)]

*  — Alien taxpayer-funded lawyers. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1596.8600000000001s)]
*  Every illegal alien would have a taxpayer-funded lawyer [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1599.74s)]
*  that's in the bill that she said she was. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1602.6200000000001s)]
*  — But Joe Biden is a current sitting president. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1603.98s)]
*  And funnel millions of dollars of left-wing organizations, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1605.3799999999999s)]
*  people, to come into our country. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1609.6999999999998s)]
*  It would enable human trafficking. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1613.26s)]
*  And by the way, she also wanted to have transgender operations [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1616.3s)]
*  for illegal migrants that were in detention. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1620.4199999999998s)]
*  Now think of that. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1623.58s)]
*  She also wanted, as you know, to defund the police. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1625.02s)]
*  She wants to defund the police. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1627.58s)]
*  She was one of the leaders in the Defund the Police Movement. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1629.54s)]
*  And that lasted for years. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1633.34s)]
*  And anybody that wants to defund the police for one day [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1634.94s)]
*  should never have the right to be president of the United States. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1638.7800000000002s)]
*  And she was one of the leaders in that movement. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1642.42s)]
*  But think of that. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1645.42s)]
*  She wants to give sex change operations [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1646.42s)]
*  to people in detention that came in illegally [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1650.22s)]
*  and are classified as illegal migrants. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1655.7800000000002s)]
*  If they want a sex change operation, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1659.22s)]
*  she said, that's okay, we'll do that. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1661.42s)]
*  The only way to secure our border is to fire. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1663.3s)]
*  Radical borders are- [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1666.58s)]
*  I don't get it. This is one of those things where it's like, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1668.78s)]
*  is this good or bad? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1670.74s)]
*  Because if sex change operations are like evil and mutilating, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1672.22s)]
*  then don't you want that to happen to the migrants? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1676.7s)]
*  Like, don't you want to punish the migrants? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1679.3s)]
*  So technically, Kamala Harris is like punishing the migrants [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1681.02s)]
*  harder than you by transing them. What happened? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1683.78s)]
*  This only makes sense if you're like, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1686.54s)]
*  they're giving migrants gender-affirming care, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1688.62s)]
*  and I hate that because gender-affirming care is great, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1691.3799999999999s)]
*  and our American citizens should be able to get it instead. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1694.1s)]
*  You know? Like, which one is it? What's going on here? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1697.26s)]
*  Like, I thought you hated these migrants. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1700.34s)]
*  And I thought you hated gender-affirming care. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1701.98s)]
*  So Kamala Harris is just punishing them by transing them. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1704.98s)]
*  It's massively up in our country. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1708.02s)]
*  It's very lucky the Department of Justice [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1710.82s)]
*  released numbers right after that debate. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1714.06s)]
*  Somebody in there might like me, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1716.26s)]
*  but they released numbers, giving the real numbers, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1718.6999999999998s)]
*  and the numbers were unbelievably shockingly high. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1721.4199999999998s)]
*  The highest ever. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1724.3s)]
*  And I haven't gotten an apology. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1725.86s)]
*  I want an apology from ABC. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1727.5s)]
*  She supports free taxpayer-funded healthcare [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1729.78s)]
*  for illegal aliens and even, as I said, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1732.3799999999999s)]
*  some of the horrible things that she's willing to do, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1736.6s)]
*  including the sex change operations for people in detention. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1739.26s)]
*  She called for abolishing immigration detention centers. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1745.1s)]
*  She wants to have detention centers, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1749.94s)]
*  but detention centers that you can get out of. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1751.78s)]
*  Remember when, in 2014, Obama built cages, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1754.46s)]
*  and the fake news tried to say, I built them. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1759.26s)]
*  Fortunately, we had a great American that said, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1762.18s)]
*  No, these were built during the Obama administration, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1765.02s)]
*  and Biden knew about it, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1769.04s)]
*  but I don't think Biden knows too much. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1770.22s)]
*  And we have one other thing that she's called. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1772.22s)]
*  She's called the grandmother of sanctuary [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1777.3s)]
*  cities. I'm going to terminate all sanctuary cities. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1780.18s)]
*  Sanctuary cities are sanctuary for — [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1782.3799999999999s)]
*  Sanctuary. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1784.3s)]
*  And, you know, you can go to California, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1786.46s)]
*  where she ruined San Francisco. She destroyed — [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1788.66s)]
*  San Francisco may have been the greatest city in the world, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1791.58s)]
*  16, 18 years ago, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1796.06s)]
*  and now it's a practically unlivable place. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1798.76s)]
*  And I hate to say that. I have property in San Francisco. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1801.98s)]
*  It's not a good thing to say, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1804.78s)]
*  but this far supersedes my ownership of property. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1806.56s)]
*  It's an unlivable place. It was the best city. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1811.28s)]
*  Bob Tisch of Lowe's, a friend of mine, great guy, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1814.16s)]
*  wonderful man. He was in San Francisco. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1817.6s)]
*  He was in Chicago. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1820.7s)]
*  He had big businesses all over the Tisch family. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1821.84s)]
*  Bob Tisch used to tell me that he thinks [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1824.92s)]
*  San Francisco is the greatest city in the country. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1826.6s)]
*  Passed away quite a while ago, but — [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1830.36s)]
*  and San Francisco probably was, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1832.76s)]
*  and now it's not even livable. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1834.64s)]
*  She destroyed it when she was the DA, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1837.3200000000002s)]
*  and she destroyed the state of California, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1839.92s)]
*  along with Gavin Newsom. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1843.0800000000002s)]
*  She destroyed the state of California when she was the AG. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1844.76s)]
*  If you can't say the phrase, illegal alien, she said, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1849.72s)]
*  then we can't trust you to secure the border. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1855.44s)]
*  She said, You're not allowed to say the phrase [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1859.2s)]
*  under any circumstance, illegal alien. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1861.8400000000001s)]
*  But that's what they are, and it's that simple. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1864.32s)]
*  She didn't want you to use that term. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1867.52s)]
*  If you used that term, you'd be fired. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1869.04s)]
*  And by the way, she fired everybody in a row. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1871.36s)]
*  She couldn't get along with anybody. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1873.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. Five months ago, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1874.96s)]
*  she was considered the worst vice president in history. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1877.84s)]
*  She was laughed at, scoffed at for three years. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1881.0s)]
*  She was the worst. Her staff hated her beyond belief. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1884.6s)]
*  They were quitting. She had — [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1889.16s)]
*  almost nobody wanted to work there. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1891.78s)]
*  She couldn't get people to work for her. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1894.08s)]
*  And she was just considered as bad as it gets. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1895.88s)]
*  And she wasn't going to be chosen. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1899.04s)]
*  No way that she was going to be chosen to replace Joe Biden. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1900.3600000000001s)]
*  We had the debate. After the debate, they said, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1903.48s)]
*  Oh, this guy, we got to change him. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1905.76s)]
*  I think we're up 21 points. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1907.64s)]
*  But they went in there, and everyone knows [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1910.08s)]
*  they threatened the 25th Amendment. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1911.9s)]
*  They threatened him with the 25th Amendment. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1914.6200000000001s)]
*  They said, Joe, you're going to get out. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1916.72s)]
*  And Nancy Pelosi led the charge. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1918.68s)]
*  And Nancy Pelosi has a little problem [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1921.04s)]
*  because her husband sold their visa stock. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1922.96s)]
*  They had a lot of visa stock one day before visa — [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1926.24s)]
*  it was announced that visa is being sued [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1929.52s)]
*  by the Department of Justice. Think of that. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1931.4s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi sold vast amounts of visa stock [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1933.8000000000002s)]
*  one day before the big lawsuit [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1939.88s)]
*  that we all read about a few days ago [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1942.52s)]
*  was brought against visa. You think it was luck? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1945.26s)]
*  I don't think. She should be prosecuted. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1948.28s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi should be prosecuted for that. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1951.08s)]
*  I mean, he's right. Also be prosecuted for — [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1954.36s)]
*  I hate to give up like this. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1956.92s)]
*  A means like this, her flowers, but he's right. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1958.6399999999999s)]
*  Or any number she wanted, soldiers or National Guard. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1961.6s)]
*  And I hope you all read John Solomon [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1965.08s)]
*  and what John Solomon wrote two days ago, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1967.22s)]
*  because if you read it, you'd see that Donald Trump [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1969.92s)]
*  did absolutely nothing wrong. It's a scam. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1973.26s)]
*  It's a scam. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1976.6399999999999s)]
*  On day one of my new administration, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1978.32s)]
*  I will stop all migrant flights immediately. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1980.16s)]
*  They should stop them tonight. She can do that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1983.48s)]
*  Just sign one little page saying, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1987.0s)]
*  Stop the migrant flights. But she won't do that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1989.1200000000001s)]
*  They're infecting our country. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1991.76s)]
*  They're destroying our country. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1993.8400000000001s)]
*  I will shut down all entries through the migrant phone app, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=1995.1200000000001s)]
*  something that most of you haven't even heard of, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2000.8000000000002s)]
*  but it's very active and taking in thousands [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2004.24s)]
*  and thousands of people a week. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2006.72s)]
*  I will end catch and release, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2009.2s)]
*  and I will restore, remain in Mexico. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2011.48s)]
*  I'm going to tell Mexico, thank you very much. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2014.6000000000001s)]
*  You're putting it back right away. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2017.2800000000002s)]
*  You're putting it back, and they will do it too, when I tell them. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2019.2800000000002s)]
*  I will bring back Title 42. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2022.4s)]
*  I will send a federal law enforcement — [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2024.4s)]
*  Nothing funnier than Trump talking about Venezuelan migrants [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2027.44s)]
*  when he is directly responsible, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2031.8000000000002s)]
*  both on the processing side for offering TPS, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2033.5600000000002s)]
*  including but not limited to extending TPS [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2036.96s)]
*  to Venezuelan migrants on his way out, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2039.36s)]
*  but also responsible for the horrifying conditions in Venezuela [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2042.0s)]
*  by greatly accelerating the sanctions regime [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2045.68s)]
*  against the Venezuelan government and the Venezuelan economy [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2050.84s)]
*  in an effort to absolutely destroy that country. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2054.16s)]
*  And of course, people saw that there was TPS [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2058.44s)]
*  to be had in the United States of America, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2060.4s)]
*  so they came here. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2062.64s)]
*  The app, real? Yes, yes, it is. What the — [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2064.08s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2066.84s)]
*  The application — [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2068.64s)]
*  The only criticism I have for the immigrant application [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2070.4s)]
*  is that it's not good enough. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2073.92s)]
*  What do you mean? It's a part of legal migration, Chad. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2076.08s)]
*  These are people that are — [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2079.72s)]
*  Like, the Customs and Border Patrol basically created a process [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2082.64s)]
*  in which instead of filing paperwork, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2087.0s)]
*  you just file an application. It's the same process. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2089.48s)]
*  It's just more streamlined. It's a government application anyway. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2093.0s)]
*  To pour across our border, this will be much larger than that, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2097.2000000000003s)]
*  but we will get rid of the drug dealers. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2101.4s)]
*  We will get rid of the human traffickers. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2104.08s)]
*  We will get rid of the people that came out of jails [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2107.44s)]
*  and the people that came out of mental institutions. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2111.2000000000003s)]
*  They will all be gone, and it will happen very quickly. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2113.56s)]
*  It's such an insane thing to complain about. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2115.8s)]
*  Like, you're literally complaining [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2118.32s)]
*  that we have found a method to faster process undocumented migrants [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2119.76s)]
*  and offer them documentation because never forget, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2124.88s)]
*  the difference between an undocumented migrant [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2128.96s)]
*  and a documented migrant, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2130.92s)]
*  like a legal immigrant versus an illegal immigrant, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2132.4s)]
*  is paperwork. He's mad that there's paperwork. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2135.1600000000003s)]
*  Anything she says tomorrow, you know, is a fraud, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2138.48s)]
*  because she was the worst in history at protecting our country, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2142.0s)]
*  so she'll try and make herself look a little bit better, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2146.2000000000003s)]
*  but it's not possible. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2148.64s)]
*  Normally, I would save this speech until after she leaves, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2149.7999999999997s)]
*  but there's not a thing she can say to make it change. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2152.88s)]
*  As you know, President Zelensky is asked to meet with me, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2155.96s)]
*  and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2159.56s)]
*  at around 9.45 in Trump Tower. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2161.68s)]
*  And it's a shame what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2164.96s)]
*  So many deaths, so much destruction. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2167.88s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2170.3199999999997s)]
*  And one of the things that are very bothersome to me [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2171.92s)]
*  is the fact that Europe is paying only a small fraction [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2175.04s)]
*  of the money that the United States of America is paying, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2178.88s)]
*  and we have a notion between Russia and ourselves. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2182.36s)]
*  They don't. So I see what's happening there. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2185.72s)]
*  It's very, very sad, but we're in for numbers [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2187.96s)]
*  that nobody can even believe. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2190.76s)]
*  And as you know, the European nations as a — [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2192.36s)]
*  Zelensky was in America, and he was like, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2196.6s)]
*  Yo, let me — let's link up and build. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2198.08s)]
*  And he was like, Nah, dog. He was like, Nah, fam, you. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2200.0s)]
*  And you know it's not because of the Logan Act, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2203.36s)]
*  or I mean, is — or was it the Hatch — [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2205.28s)]
*  no, it's the Logan Act, right? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2207.6400000000003s)]
*  Like the president trying to secure favors [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2208.8s)]
*  from foreign officials in an effort to win the election. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2212.84s)]
*  Yeah, the Logan Paul Act. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2218.48s)]
*  No, I was confusing it with Hatch Act, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2220.6400000000003s)]
*  which is another thing that he regularly, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2222.28s)]
*  which is campaigning on official government property. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2223.8s)]
*  And I think funneling money to his business — [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2226.96s)]
*  I mean, he did everything. Anyway, he leaked a message. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2229.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God, he's such a bratty — [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2232.92s)]
*  Pouring in. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2234.4s)]
*  Nobody else wanted to say that, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2235.4s)]
*  and the press thought it was terrible [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2236.84s)]
*  that I made that statement. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2238.1600000000003s)]
*  But if I didn't make that statement, we'd still be paying. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2239.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, we were paying for NATO, most of it, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2242.52s)]
*  almost all of it, maybe all of it, for years. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2244.4s)]
*  So I'm going to see President Zelensky tomorrow, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2247.32s)]
*  and thank you all very much. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2249.92s)]
*  Oh, so he is linking up with him. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2252.28s)]
*  He has been a fair child. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2253.8s)]
*  He is linking up with him. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2255.28s)]
*  I thought he said he wasn't going to, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2256.7200000000003s)]
*  and then he leaked the message. W. Collab. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2258.28s)]
*  I thought you had the worst mayor ever [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2262.0s)]
*  that we had prior to him. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2263.96s)]
*  I will say this. I watched about a year ago [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2266.64s)]
*  when he talked about how the illegal migrants [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2270.2s)]
*  are hurting our city, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2273.56s)]
*  and the federal government should pay us, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2275.0s)]
*  and we shouldn't have to take them. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2276.7999999999997s)]
*  And I said, you know what? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2278.7599999999998s)]
*  He'll be indicted within a year. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2279.88s)]
*  And I was exactly right, because that's what we have. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2282.48s)]
*  We have people that use the Justice Department [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2286.08s)]
*  and the FBI at levels that have never been seen before. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2291.16s)]
*  So I wish him luck. I don't know anything about what he did. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2295.4s)]
*  But I told a lot of group, a lot of people, right over there, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2298.48s)]
*  that group was saying, you know, sir, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2302.56s)]
*  you were right about that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2303.72s)]
*  When they mentioned that, I said — [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2305.44s)]
*  they came in, and he was pretty strong about it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2308.0s)]
*  He said, this is really unfair to make us carry this burden. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2310.64s)]
*  We shouldn't be doing this. This is New York City. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2314.52s)]
*  I mean, your parks are loaded up. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2317.08s)]
*  I just passed recently Madison Avenue, the Roosevelt Hotel. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2319.48s)]
*  It's like nobody would recognize it. That's midtown. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2322.96s)]
*  But he came out very strongly against it. He was right. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2326.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's why they indicted him, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2329.4s)]
*  because he was anti-undocumented migrant. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2330.6s)]
*  And I said, he will be indicted within a year. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2333.52s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2336.2400000000002s)]
*  And I noticed the indictment is very old. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2337.2400000000002s)]
*  This goes back a long time. Well, I had the same thing. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2339.32s)]
*  They went way before the statute of limitations. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2342.0s)]
*  So I wish him well, but I said that he will be indicted [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2345.96s)]
*  because he did that. You take a look. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2349.4s)]
*  That's what they do. These are dirty players. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2350.84s)]
*  These are bad people. They cheat. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2352.8s)]
*  And they do anything necessary. These are bad people. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2355.2000000000003s)]
*  And we need an honest Justice Department. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2359.6s)]
*  We need an honest FBI. And we need it fast. Yeah. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2361.88s)]
*  Q. K. Estama, the UK premier. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2364.56s)]
*  Yes, he's coming tonight. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2367.08s)]
*  What do you think of him? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2368.92s)]
*  Some of his colleagues in government [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2370.0s)]
*  are quite critical of you. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2371.4s)]
*  Well, I'm going to see him in about an hour, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2372.6800000000003s)]
*  so I have to be nice, right? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2374.6800000000003s)]
*  But I actually think he's very nice. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2376.48s)]
*  I think he ran a great race. He did very well. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2378.08s)]
*  It's very early, but he's popular. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2381.48s)]
*  And I'll be seeing him and I'll send you your regards. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2383.08s)]
*  He's not popular. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2385.2s)]
*  Who are you with? Who are you with? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2386.64s)]
*  I'm with GB News in the UK. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2387.88s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2389.36s)]
*  Would you rather Nigel Farage [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2390.04s)]
*  would have had a bigger, bigger role? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2391.48s)]
*  Well, I think Nigel is great. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2392.52s)]
*  I mean, I've known him for a long time. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2394.44s)]
*  He had a great election, too. He picked up a lot of seats. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2395.7999999999997s)]
*  More seats than he was allowed to have, actually. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2398.4s)]
*  They acknowledged that he won, but for some reason, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2401.04s)]
*  you have a very strange system over there. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2403.12s)]
*  You might win him, but you don't get him. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2404.98s)]
*  Nigel is a fantastic person. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2407.12s)]
*  Would you rather Nigel be the President? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2409.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's GB News, Chad. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2411.88s)]
*  It's their fake Fox News in the UK. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2413.24s)]
*  Oh, then I should immediately cancel my appointment. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2415.3599999999997s)]
*  No. He knows. He knows I understand. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2417.8399999999997s)]
*  Look, look, I hate to see the carnage. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2420.3199999999997s)]
*  If I were President, it never would have happened. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2424.0s)]
*  Russia would have never attacked Ukraine. Never, ever. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2426.7999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, President Xi would have never even thought [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2431.52s)]
*  about Taiwan, which he's thinking about very seriously now. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2434.2s)]
*  Flying planes over it every single day. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2437.04s)]
*  But President Putin would have never attacked. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2439.28s)]
*  When I look at the horror show that's gone on, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2442.48s)]
*  and the level of death is far greater [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2446.32s)]
*  than what is being reported. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2448.6s)]
*  When you look at those cities, they're all knocked down. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2450.76s)]
*  Those beautiful, gorgeous golden domes, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2453.12s)]
*  they're shattered and lying on their side, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2455.56s)]
*  never to be replaced again. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2457.92s)]
*  You can't ever replace that. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2459.08s)]
*  Two thousand years old. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2460.32s)]
*  When you look at the heritage of that really very vibrant country [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2462.52s)]
*  in so many different ways, and you see how it's been so broken. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2466.44s)]
*  Ukraine, a very vibrant country. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2469.32s)]
*  Where they have to use old soldiers, old men and young boys [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2471.68s)]
*  because they're running out of soldiers. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2474.96s)]
*  It's a very terrible thing. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2476.8s)]
*  And then you see that the United States is paying for most of it [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2478.08s)]
*  and Europe is not chipping in. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2481.52s)]
*  And all you have to do with Europe [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2483.12s)]
*  is the same thing I did with NATO. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2484.32s)]
*  Say you have to pay. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2485.76s)]
*  And if you say you have to pay, they will. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2487.44s)]
*  It's very unfair to the United States. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2489.48s)]
*  But I look forward to seeing him tomorrow. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2491.2000000000003s)]
*  We'll see. I do believe I disagree with him. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2493.4s)]
*  Well, he doesn't know me, but I disagree. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2495.64s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2497.8799999999997s)]
*  I believe I will be able to make a deal [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2500.0s)]
*  between President Putin and President Zelensky quite quickly. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2501.8399999999997s)]
*  But what does that look like? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2506.6s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2508.2s)]
*  I don't want to tell you what that looks like. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2510.04s)]
*  The Vice President suggested today [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2512.48s)]
*  that your strategy with Ukraine amounts to surrender to Russia. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2513.8399999999997s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2516.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I don't think so. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2517.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's not a surrender. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2519.2s)]
*  What my strategy is to save lives, I want to save lives. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2521.68s)]
*  Millions of people are dead, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2525.04s)]
*  millions more than they even think about. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2526.64s)]
*  And it's not my fight, but it is a fight to save humanity. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2529.12s)]
*  That is a terrible — let me explain — [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2534.44s)]
*  that is a terrible war that would have never happened. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2538.04s)]
*  And it didn't happen. I even have Democrats — [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2541.0s)]
*  I watched them on Deface the Nation [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2545.12s)]
*  and some of the shows this weekend. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2547.32s)]
*  And they said, well, we agree that it wouldn't have happened [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2549.64s)]
*  if Trump were president. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2552.32s)]
*  I was very generous of them. But it would have never happened. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2553.52s)]
*  That's what bothers me even more. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2557.52s)]
*  There was no reason for that war to happen. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2559.08s)]
*  But it did happen, and millions of people are dead, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2563.08s)]
*  including soldiers from both sides. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2566.8s)]
*  It's so sad to see it. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2569.8s)]
*  And I'll meet with President Zelensky [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2571.2s)]
*  and we'll see what happens. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2575.44s)]
*  But I believe I can work that out. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2577.0s)]
*  It would have been — I will say this — [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2579.44s)]
*  it would have been a lot easier to work out prior to the start. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2581.52s)]
*  And Putin never, ever even thought about going in. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2585.56s)]
*  And it was the apple of his eye. I knew him very well. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2590.16s)]
*  Had a very good relationship. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2592.8s)]
*  Despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2594.68s)]
*  it was a total hoax. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2596.68s)]
*  But we had a very good relationship. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2598.56s)]
*  Fortunately, otherwise, we could have ended up in war over there. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2601.28s)]
*  That's very dangerous. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2603.92s)]
*  You know, when you make up stories like that, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2604.84s)]
*  it's very dangerous. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2606.4s)]
*  The laptop from hell was very dangerous. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2607.68s)]
*  But Putin told me often — it's the apple of his eye. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2610.56s)]
*  But I said, Vladimir, don't even think about doing it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2615.28s)]
*  He would have never done it. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2617.88s)]
*  And then, of course, through stupid oil policies [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2618.88s)]
*  and energy policies, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2622.36s)]
*  where oil get up to almost $100 a barrel, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2624.28s)]
*  Putin said, wow, I have a lot more money than I thought I had. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2628.0s)]
*  And he prosecuted the war. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2632.04s)]
*  But even if it went up — and it wouldn't have gone up like that. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2633.36s)]
*  That's what caused inflation, that and stupid spending [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2636.28s)]
*  for the Green New Deal, which was a Green New Scam, turned out. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2639.28s)]
*  Do you notice that they don't ever mention anything [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2642.48s)]
*  about environment anymore? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2644.6000000000004s)]
*  What happened to the environment? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2647.2400000000002s)]
*  They don't mention it. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2649.32s)]
*  They don't mention that the ocean is going to rise [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2650.6800000000003s)]
*  a quarter of an inch over the next 500 years. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2652.92s)]
*  This is like good Trump, okay? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2654.8s)]
*  Like, good for his own audience and good messaging. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2657.5600000000004s)]
*  What they should start mentioning is nuclear warming. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2660.2000000000003s)]
*  Because we're in grave danger. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2664.6800000000003s)]
*  That right there is like old-school Trump [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2666.1200000000003s)]
*  using the Democratic incompetence against them to be like, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2668.4s)]
*  what happened? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2671.28s)]
*  Do you not care about the environment no more? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2672.4s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2674.2400000000002s)]
*  Or maybe it was fake and you know it is like exactly [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2675.6800000000003s)]
*  the type of messaging he should be hammering on, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  like, immigration too, which he does a little bit more now. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2681.0s)]
*  October 7th would have never happened. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2683.04s)]
*  Iran had no money. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2685.0s)]
*  I guess that's probably why you hear the stories about Iran. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2686.04s)]
*  Only a consequential president would have this happen. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2689.56s)]
*  Only a consequential president. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2693.88s)]
*  But Iran would have made a deal with us. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2695.96s)]
*  There would have been a great deal for them. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2698.16s)]
*  The only thing is they cannot have nuclear weapons. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2699.6s)]
*  And we would have had it because Iran had no money. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2702.3599999999997s)]
*  During my administration, they were broke. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2706.24s)]
*  And they would have made a deal and they would have been happy. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2709.3199999999997s)]
*  And they would have had an unbelievable civilization. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2712.56s)]
*  But it didn't work out that way because of a thing [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2715.56s)]
*  that was very sad to watch. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2718.2s)]
*  That was the election. Very sad thing to watch. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2722.6s)]
*  Would you still make a deal with them now, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2724.88s)]
*  after everything that's happened? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2726.04s)]
*  If you're a real- Make a deal with who? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2727.2400000000002s)]
*  Make a deal with who? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2728.8s)]
*  Would you try to make a deal with Iran of some kind, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2729.7200000000003s)]
*  if you were re-elected? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2731.36s)]
*  Sure, I would do that. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2732.28s)]
*  I believe in getting, you know, it doesn't- [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2733.8s)]
*  Why are you hyping him up? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2737.1600000000003s)]
*  I have a great memory, but it's a memory- [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2738.32s)]
*  I also hate migrants. That's why I'm hyping him up. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2741.56s)]
*  And not actually offering sound analysis. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2744.8s)]
*  A lot of what Trump is saying is really horrible. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2747.92s)]
*  Okay, like horrible on the moral grounds. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2750.6400000000003s)]
*  But sometimes he's still capable of presenting [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2753.44s)]
*  a genuine threat in terms of his messaging. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2756.92s)]
*  That was one of those moments where he had a good one. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2760.96s)]
*  After the election, they could have done that too, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2764.16s)]
*  but they had no idea how to go about it. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2767.72s)]
*  They could have done it because I gave them a country [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2770.04s)]
*  that wanted to make a deal. They had to. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2773.04s)]
*  There was no money to Hamas. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2775.36s)]
*  There was no money to Hezbollah [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2776.92s)]
*  because Iran didn't have the money. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2779.24s)]
*  Now Iran has $300 billion. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2781.0s)]
*  They made it all in the last- [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2783.68s)]
*  they made it all in the last three and a half years. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2785.76s)]
*  The sanctions came off. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2788.4s)]
*  They made it all in the last three and a half years. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2789.64s)]
*  Plus, they essentially have Iraq as a subsidiary, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2792.28s)]
*  and Iraq has $300 billion. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2796.28s)]
*  So, Iran is a very rich country. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2800.48s)]
*  They have $600 to $650 billion, including Iraq. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2802.28s)]
*  Iraq doesn't like it when I say that, but that's true. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2806.92s)]
*  They're really a subsidiary because, foolishly, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2809.44s)]
*  Bush wiped out- you had two forces, two powerful forces. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2812.4s)]
*  One of those forces got wiped out, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2817.52s)]
*  and now the other force, after a thousand years, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2820.52s)]
*  walks in and just essentially takes it over. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2824.32s)]
*  So, it's very sad to watch. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2827.4s)]
*  But Iran now is a big force because they're very rich. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2828.68s)]
*  Iran was not rich at all. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2831.64s)]
*  Iran didn't have the money to take care [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2833.36s)]
*  of the various organizations of terror. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2835.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2838.56s)]
*  The Press. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2839.56s)]
*  Yesterday, the U.N. General Assembly came together [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2840.56s)]
*  to call for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2841.56s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking at the U.N. tomorrow. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2843.56s)]
*  He has refused to do that. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2846.36s)]
*  What would you do differently to prevent the Middle East- [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2848.12s)]
*  The President. Well, you have to have that ended one way or the other. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2850.84s)]
*  The world isn't going to take it. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2854.24s)]
*  You have to have that ended. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2857.04s)]
*  And I would think that we're getting close to a point [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2858.84s)]
*  where maybe it can end pretty soon. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2861.7599999999998s)]
*  But you're going to have to end that that's unacceptable. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2864.44s)]
*  The whole thing over there is unacceptable. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2866.52s)]
*  That's another one. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2868.24s)]
*  October 7th would have never happened. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2869.4399999999996s)]
*  Would have never happened. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2872.3199999999997s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia would have never happened. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2873.7599999999998s)]
*  Think of it. Would have never happened. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2875.9599999999996s)]
*  Inflation would have never happened. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2877.7999999999997s)]
*  Think of the world. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2879.3199999999997s)]
*  The Afghanistan pullout in that way. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2880.8399999999997s)]
*  We would have pulled out, but we would have pulled out [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2883.2799999999997s)]
*  with dignity and strength. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2885.52s)]
*  I'm the one that got it down to that number. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2886.64s)]
*  But I would have kept Bagram. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2888.72s)]
*  Because Bagram is this massive air force base [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2890.3999999999996s)]
*  that we built many, many years ago [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2894.8399999999997s)]
*  with billions and billions of dollars. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2896.56s)]
*  The most powerful runways that can hold more load [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2898.7599999999998s)]
*  than any other runway in the world. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2901.2s)]
*  And we walked away from it. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2903.04s)]
*  And it wasn't Afghanistan that was the problem. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2905.16s)]
*  We walked away from a great military base [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2909.6s)]
*  that we built to the highest specifications [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2913.12s)]
*  that was one hour away from where China [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2916.52s)]
*  makes its nuclear weapons. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2921.56s)]
*  We are being run by Kamala, who is grossly incompetent. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2924.24s)]
*  All you have to do is look at her interview last night. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2929.0s)]
*  Look at her interview with Oprah. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2932.96s)]
*  Look at her interview with the gentleman from Pennsylvania. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2936.08s)]
*  All you have to do is look around and you'll see it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2940.56s)]
*  We had four years of incompetent leadership [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2943.4399999999996s)]
*  as a country sustained another four years. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2946.3199999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2949.3199999999997s)]
*  Are you going to pull your endorsement in Mark Robinson? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2954.72s)]
*  I don't know the situation. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2957.64s)]
*  Terrible pause. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2958.56s)]
*  Do you think that Ukraine should turn over [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2959.2799999999997s)]
*  some of its own land to Russia in order to end the war? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2960.3599999999997s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2963.7999999999997s)]
*  What's your message to the world? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2965.04s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2965.96s)]
*  Let's get some peace. We need peace. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2967.6s)]
*  We need to stop the death and destruction. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2970.3199999999997s)]
*  Don't you think? Wouldn't that be nice? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2972.48s)]
*  Do you have a problem to meet Gen. Gen. Yeltsin? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2975.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you have to meet him? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2977.12s)]
*  Well, we're going to meet a lot of people. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2978.52s)]
*  Many of the leaders have been calling me and they want to ... [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2980.16s)]
*  He can't fucking just be like, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2982.88s)]
*  Democrats just want to continue the death machine in Ukraine [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2984.32s)]
*  because they're getting paid, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2987.92s)]
*  because they're making money off the military-industrial complex. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2989.7200000000003s)]
*  And like, they don't want to have any sort of conversation [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2993.04s)]
*  with the enemy in this circumstance. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2996.92s)]
*  But all war ends up ... [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=2998.56s)]
*  All wars end with treaties. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=3001.52s)]
*  The reason why he can't say that is because he's also, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=3003.2000000000003s)]
*  obviously, a slave to the same exact corporate interests. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=3006.56s)]
*  He's also a slave to the military-industrial complex. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=3009.7200000000003s)]
*  So, that's precisely the reason why he can't even [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=3012.96s)]
*  like adequately message himself as like ... [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=3015.28s)]
*  Adequately message himself around this issue. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-vI9xveo0&t=3020.04s)]
