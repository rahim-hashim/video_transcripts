# Trump Betrayed Gaza After Hamas Deal | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc)
*  For 76 days Israel had banned all food, medicine, water, and fuel from entering Gaza. The siege had [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=0.0s)]
*  plunged the population into a state of forced starvation. Nearly the entire population of Gaza [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=8.16s)]
*  is facing severe levels of food insecurity and thousands of children are already suffering from [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=13.44s)]
*  acute malnutrition. These numbers are expected to rise dramatically in the coming months if the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=16.8s)]
*  blockade is not lifted. Anyway, he's a phenomenal person. Reach out to Theo before someone like [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=21.44s)]
*  Candace Owens does. Ironic you say that because he had me on a show but he also had Candace Owens [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=31.68s)]
*  before me the day before me apparently and I didn't even know. Finished his week-long trip to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=36.72s)]
*  the Middle East this morning with deal making front and center of his agenda. He made one last [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  sales pitch to the region's business leaders hoping they will invest as much as possible in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=47.28s)]
*  the U.S. Nancy Cordes covered Trump's visit. She joins us now from Abu Dhabi, capital of the United [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=52.0s)]
*  Arab Emirates. Nancy, good morning. Good morning, Nate. The president just departed Abu Dhabi after [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  touting billions of dollars worth of new investments in U.S. companies especially when it comes to AI, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  airplanes and military equipment. He leaves without a breakthrough in the Gaza-Israel [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=72.56s)]
*  conflict but this was less of a trip focused on regional tension and more of a trip focused [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=78.48s)]
*  on dollars and cents. Yeah, I mean exactly as expected. Boeing makes the best plane. The [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  president served as pitch man for U.S. industry this morning as business leaders here in Abu Dhabi [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=93.44s)]
*  did their best to impress. We're also announcing today our first flight to Charlotte. Oh good. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=99.6s)]
*  North Carolina. That's a good place. This first major foreign trip of Trump's second term was a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  departure from traditional foreign policy. Instead it was diplomacy by commerce. So it's over 200 [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=113.28s)]
*  billion dollars but 160 in terms of the jets that's fantastic. 600 billion knowingly will be a trillion [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=120.88s)]
*  dollars. Trump bypassed long-standing regional allies like Israel and Jordan to visit three [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=128.48s)]
*  booming oil and gas rich Gulf states. We have a president of the United States doing the selling. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=135.12s)]
*  It's hard to know at this point how much of this investment was driven by the salesman in chief [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=141.2s)]
*  and how much was already in the works. These quickly growing countries have been aggressively [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=146.56s)]
*  importing American excellence for years. The Cleveland Clinic opened an outpost in Abu Dhabi [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=152.56s)]
*  in 2015 and Disney just announced plans to build a new theme park here. Fantastic. Indoors to beat [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=158.24s)]
*  the heat. In all three nations Trump urged the leaders to go even bigger and buy even more from [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=164.88s)]
*  us. We're a hot country just like you're a hot area. I can tell you that our country is hot. It's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=171.44s)]
*  hot as a pistol. We were not such a hot country six months ago and now I think we're the hottest [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=177.76s)]
*  country if you want to know the truth. President Trump is now on his way back to the... They're [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=184.0s)]
*  not just milking Trump. Trump is milking them as well. It's just direct quid pro quo corrupt deal [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=191.04s)]
*  making and the way it's taking place the way it's taking place is happening in the backdrop of a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=197.76s)]
*  ****ing **** side that has escalated as Israel seeks to punish the Palestinian civilian population [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=205.92s)]
*  again and again and again because they feel angry and resentful that the... They feel angry and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  resentful that Trump even aesthetically sidestepped them to talk to Hamas directly. And here's a good [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=222.72s)]
*  take as well. If democratic elections were held today in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar, Jordan, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Egypt, they would elect governments that will break off all relations with the Genocide and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=234.8s)]
*  vow to destroy it. So the US props up fascist puppets that violently suppress them. That's it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=238.0s)]
*  When Iran retaliated against the genocide of Zionist entity, the US NATO Israeli Empire's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Arab shield was activated, literally shooting down missiles aimed at Israel, risking the lives of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  their own people. That is how much contempt these fascist puppets have for their own population. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  They literally shot missiles at the Iranian missiles that fell on top of their own [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=256.72s)]
*  citizens potentially. And Egypt is a great example of this because they did have elections and then [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=264.4s)]
*  lo and behold, a coup took place. That is not true at all. Yeah. Why are these... Why are these [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=270.08s)]
*  countries ruled by monarchy still? I thought America cared about democracy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  You think that's not by design? Why is the Jordanian king... Why did the Jordanian king [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=286.0s)]
*  train with the British Navy? The f**k? King, then why is Israel still geopolitically important to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=291.84s)]
*  the US now when all Arab and neighboring countries in the ME are US puppets now? Because [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=298.96s)]
*  why would you... Gulf citizens don't care? That's not true. No, that's not f**king true. That's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  absolutely not true. If you think that Arab... If you think that Arab citizens are... [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  If you think that Arab citizens across the board are not... Are oblivious or [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=320.24s)]
*  careless or don't give a s**t, you are delusional because that is the only reason why the Gulf [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=327.36s)]
*  leadership still maintains this posture towards Palestinians. The only reason why [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=334.56s)]
*  leadership in that region makes it seem as though they care about Palestinians is so that they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=341.92s)]
*  don't have rebellion, okay? Because the reality of the matter is you have to at least like offer [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=347.84s)]
*  something to your citizens and the same goes for Turkey as well. Why do you think Erdogan makes it [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=355.2s)]
*  seem as though he is positioned against Israel over and over and over again? The reason why... By [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  the way, I'm Lebanese and half the population was against involvement in the Palestine situation [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=367.44s)]
*  is such a funny thing to mention because Lebanon was literally packing up pro-Palestinian protesters [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=371.12s)]
*  and putting them in unmarked vans and s**t and arresting them. What are you talking about? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=376.8s)]
*  In many of these countries, like if you have a Palestine flag in Mecca, they will take it away [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=380.88000000000005s)]
*  from you. That's in Mecca. That's the heart of Islam, right? I think it's completely... I think [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  it's completely ridiculous. Gulf citizens literally can't speak. It's illegal to criticize normalization [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  with Israel in the UAE. Yeah. UAE government intensifies suppression of voices opposing its [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=400.0s)]
*  policies escalates rights violations. But of course, none of this, none of this is ever talked [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=407.04s)]
*  about. Why is none of this ever talked about in the Western media? Just like the same people that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=413.28s)]
*  constantly talk about like Houthis being backwards and homophobic and having horrifying practices [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=419.04s)]
*  against women and all the s**t. They don't have a peep to say about any of the Gulf states [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=425.44s)]
*  because they're aligned with Israel. That's it. And therefore, because of their alignment with [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=431.84s)]
*  Israel, America lets them do whatever the f**k they want. And America gives them a steady flow [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=438.32s)]
*  of weapons, weapons that they can inevitably use to suppress their own citizens as well. If there [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=443.44s)]
*  is some sort of revolt or rebellion, some sort of coup, a recent opinion poll revealed that 96% [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=448.32s)]
*  of Saudis believe that Arab countries should cut all ties with Israel and protest against the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=455.2s)]
*  Israeli force aggression against the Gaza Strip according to the New York Times. I'm telling you [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  right now, if the Gulf nation states, if Gulf nation states, especially ones that have like high [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=461.68s)]
*  population, a high number of people, as opposed to like a tiny population that benefits tremendously [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=468.48s)]
*  from being oil barons with a healthy dose of subsidies and is almost entirely comprised of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  of like voluntary and involuntary slave labor style practices, like there's a lot of these Gulf [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  countries that just like don't have a lot of people in them and are simply kept up, propped up by [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  immigrant labor, some of which resembles slave labor practices or are directly considered slave [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  labor practices. If those countries had these chatters making up their own stats when the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=507.52s)]
*  Lebanese population of 79% support for Hamas outright not to mention ending a general [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  Palestine. Yeah, dude, if America is like 53% unfavorable to Israel, if you think the countries [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=518.72s)]
*  that are getting bombed by Israel or within proximity of Israel don't have an even more [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=527.28s)]
*  negative view on Israel, you are delusional. It is the very fact that the citizens of these [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=532.48s)]
*  nation states that have this anti-Israel slant, that is the reason why the Gulf leadership has [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=538.72s)]
*  to make it seem as though they're not super pro-Israel. That is the reason they have to say [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  that. Otherwise, there will be insane protests that even they cannot squash with all weapons that they [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  get and the American training that they get. Where does Qatar fit in? Qatar is out of all the Gulf [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=557.28s)]
*  States, the only one that has at least a neutral position on Palestinians. They are still, of course, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=563.36s)]
*  very much in favor of normalizing with Israel and they have a similar undemocratic structure as well. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  But having said that, they are at least neutral. And here's what I wanted to talk about. And this [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=576.0s)]
*  is what my fears were and my greatest fears are being realized in this process. Hamas says, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=582.8s)]
*  Wittkopf personally promised to lift the Gaza blockade in exchange for Eden Alexander. The [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=588.8s)]
*  U.S. immediately broke the deal. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim tells DropSight, they threw [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  it in the trash and there's been zero progress on a Gaza ceasefire. A senior Hamas official told [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  DropSight that the group received a direct commitment from Donald Trump's special envoy, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=603.52s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf, that two days after the release of U.S. citizen and Israeli soldier Eden Alexander, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration would compel Israel to lift the Gaza blockade and allow humanitarian aid [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=611.68s)]
*  to enter the territory. Wittkopf, according to the official, also promised that Trump would make [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=617.76s)]
*  a public call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and for negotiations aimed at achieving a permanent [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=622.64s)]
*  ceasefire. It was a deal, said Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas's political bureau who has previously [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=626.64s)]
*  engaged in direct talks with U.S. officials. He said the pledge was made by Wittkopf himself. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=632.16s)]
*  In an interview with DropSight, Naim said the agreement was if we release Alexander, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=636.88s)]
*  Trump will speak out thanking Hamas for this gesture, obliging Israel on the second day to [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=641.28s)]
*  open the borders and allow aid to come into Gaza. And Trump would call for an immediate ceasefire [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=645.28s)]
*  and to go for negotiations to end the war. He did nothing of this, Naim added. They didn't violate [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  the deal. They threw it in the trash. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=655.28s)]
*  The release of Alexander, who was taken by Palestinian fighters on October 7, 2023, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=660.48s)]
*  from the Israeli military base where he was stationed, was a significant event. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=664.56s)]
*  He was the first male soldier freed by Hamas since the war began 19 months ago. Hamas said it freed [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=669.28s)]
*  him as a gesture of goodwill towards Trump because it believed it had received commitment, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=674.96s)]
*  a commitment Alexander's release would result in the immediate delivery of food, medicine, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=681.76s)]
*  and fuel into Gaza. On Friday, as Trump wrapped up his tour of Gulf nations, he briefly addressed [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=685.12s)]
*  the Gaza war and the dire humanitarian catastrophe caused by Israel's full-spectrum blockade of Gaza, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=691.12s)]
*  where 76 days Israel had banned all food, medicine, water, and fuel from entering Gaza. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=698.24s)]

*  taken care of, Trump said at a public event in the UAE. A lot of people are starving, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=723.84s)]
*  a lot of people, there's a lot of bad things going on. Naim acknowledged Trump's remarks [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=728.48s)]
*  about starvation in Gaza, but pointed out that the day prior Trump had once again raised the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=734.4s)]

*  it just a freedom zone. In February, standing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  at the White House, Trump announced that he wanted to transform Gaza into a US-owned Middle East [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=748.3199999999999s)]

*  We are looking for actions. Now I want to maintain something here, okay, is a position that I've had [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=758.32s)]
*  for a long time, okay, which is that Hamas and Iran, regardless of their domestic affairs, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  regardless of their fucking worldview or fundamentalist perspectives from time to time, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=769.84s)]

*  okay, because they recognize that their position is lower than dirt in the global eyes, in the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=783.68s)]
*  global stage. And for this reason, they are always a much better party to negotiate with [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=788.88s)]
*  than fucking Israel. But because America does not give a shit about them due to their position, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=795.68s)]
*  that is that they will always be dominated, especially Hamas, and will always be dominated [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=802.32s)]
*  by the belligerent occupier Israel, that they don't care. They fucking come in and they say, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=807.0400000000001s)]

*  across the board are completely alone. Okay, they're alone. None of the Gulf leadership cares [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=836.4s)]
*  about their well-being. None of them care enough to stop this genocide. They care about getting [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=844.64s)]
*  good business deals done. Okay. Even Iran doesn't fucking care about the Palestinians as much as [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=849.12s)]
*  as people seem to think that they do. That's it. And the only other group, the two groups that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=857.52s)]

*  plans which would not be linked to any ceasefire to deliver aid in the Gaza Strip. The White House [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=889.36s)]
*  has said it would empower a newly created an NGO to formally run the program alongside US security [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  contractors. This proposal for aid distribution involves a system of political vetting and [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=899.04s)]
*  calorie restrictions and it would require Palestinians to travel long distances to pass [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  extensive security checks to receive meager rations of food. Pre-approved representatives of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=906.56s)]
*  families in Gaza would be permitted to pick up food supplies once every other week under the plan. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=911.28s)]
*  While Israeli forces would not distribute the aid, the army would be involved with security. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=916.0s)]
*  It's literally straight up Auschwitz shit. Okay. It's fucking insane. Yes, I know. My Kyle Kalinsky [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=920.0s)]

*  May. Israel's indicated that the aid distribution would be run from southern Gaza near the border [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=954.4s)]
*  with Egypt. UN officials have warned that the plan could be a part of Israel's stated aim of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=958.8s)]
*  driving hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from northern and central Gaza to the south. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=963.0400000000001s)]

*  finished his tour of the Gulf. Its explicit aim would be the conquest of the Gaza Strip, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=974.72s)]
*  an open-ended occupation enforced by wide-scale attacks and the destruction of Gaza's remaining [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=979.28s)]
*  infrastructure. Palestinians would be herded into the wasteland of what was once Rafa. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=983.84s)]
*  In the days leading up to Trump's trip to the Gulf, Netanyahu authorized a dramatic escalation [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=989.12s)]
*  of Israel's terror bombing of Gaza and began amassing troops along the stretches of Gaza. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  In the days leading up to Trump's trip to the Gulf, now we're talking about that, on Friday, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1001.6s)]
*  more than 90 Palestinians were killed and over 200 wounded in Israeli attacks going to Gaza's [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1006.4s)]
*  health ministry. Nearly 3,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel resumed its relentless [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  assault on March 18th, with at least 250 killed in just the past two days. The ministry's director [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1014.08s)]
*  general, Minir al-Barsh, described the attacks on the trip as the most heinous massacres of [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1020.1600000000001s)]
*  ethnic cleansing. The Israeli military has issued mass displacement orders for Beit Lahiya, Jabalia, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1024.4s)]
*  and other northern areas, causing panicked families to flee their homes with no safe haven to go to. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1030.32s)]
*  Whether you're in shelters, tents, buildings, evacuate to the south immediately, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1034.8s)]
*  read leafless drop of the Israeli military over the areas. In northern Gaza, paramedic Mohamed [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1037.8400000000001s)]
*  Abouloa reported over 15 airstrikes hitting densely populated residential zones, including [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1042.08s)]
*  Tal al-Zatar and Jabalia camp. Entire families remain trapped or missing under the rubble. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1046.96s)]
*  Mohamed Buzal, spokesman for Gaza Civil Defense, described the assault as a night of horrors [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1051.52s)]
*  of the Day of Judgment. He described Israeli forces intensifying indiscriminate bombings, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1056.8s)]
*  striking inhabited homes without warning and targeting ambulance crews attempting to reach [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1063.76s)]
*  survivors in a process known as double-striking or double-tapping, where they hit an area and [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1067.2s)]
*  then ambulances come and first responders come and people try to take people out of the rubble [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1072.56s)]
*  and they hit the people that are trying to take people out of the rubble. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1079.68s)]
*  Hamas' zero progress has been made on the ceasefire. While Wyckoff, according to Hamas, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1082.88s)]
*  has promised the U.S. would facilitate the lifting of Israel's blockade on Gaza two days [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1086.72s)]
*  after Alexander's release, the U.S. appeared to completely abandon the agreement. On May 13th, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1089.92s)]
*  the day after Hamas freed Alexander, Israel launched a massive series of airstrikes. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1095.44s)]
*  Israeli officials have suggested that targeting Sinwar would soften Hamas' stance in negotiations, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1099.44s)]
*  claiming that Qassam commander was enforcing a hard line. Hamas has not confirmed Sinwar's death [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1103.68s)]
*  and Naim dismissed the idea that killing him would have any impact. I think this is part of [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1107.8400000000001s)]
*  the Israeli strategy, but it is proven that the strategy is failing for 17 months. They have killed [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1111.44s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar, they've killed Dave, they've killed Marwan Issa. They've killed a lot of leaders and [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  no one has witnessed a clear breakdown, not only in the negotiation but also in the whole battle, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
*  the whole fighters, tactics and strategies, Naim said. This is the other side of the story, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1125.2s)]
*  is that the reason why you're not seeing a lot of Israeli soldiers die right now is because [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1129.76s)]
*  they're cowardly lobbing missiles, okay, from their planes against a defenseless population. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1136.0800000000002s)]
*  But once the ground invasion starts, deaths are obviously also going to escalate. But you will [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1142.8s)]
*  see whether or not Hamas or any fucking militant resistance group has the capacity to fight back. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1149.44s)]
*  This is precisely what happened last time they invaded with boots on the ground. And even then, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1154.88s)]
*  it doesn't matter because before a single Israeli occupying force boot hits the ground, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1160.96s)]
*  Israel pummels that ground into oblivion. Witkoff and Adam Baylor, the White House special envoy [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1167.68s)]
*  and hostages held several meetings in Doha this week with Israeli negotiators as well as with [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1172.64s)]
*  regional media from Qatar and Egypt. Both US officials publicly expressed optimism this week [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1175.8400000000001s)]
*  that a deal could be on the horizon. Naim said that there's been no progress, zero, he said, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1181.76s)]
*  big zero. They returned back to talking about the Israeli proposal or the Israeli Witkoff proposal [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1186.4s)]
*  as if nothing happened during the last one or two weeks, including the release of Alexander, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1191.04s)]
*  who was released within the context of direct talks with the Americans, Naim said. They're [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1194.88s)]
*  insisting on gradual or partial deals. They are talking about partial deals to release some of [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1198.5600000000002s)]
*  the prisoners for a temporary ceasefire and then to go to war, to go for open negotiations without [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1202.96s)]
*  any commitment to end the war. And yes, in the process of this last night, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1209.12s)]
*  last night, troops amassed at the border, heavy reinforcement on the Gaza border tonight. This [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  was last night. I covered this yesterday gearing up towards what is expected to be a brutal, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1219.1999999999998s)]
*  brutal slaughterhouse style invasion. They're gearing up for a massive ground operation. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1223.28s)]
*  And that is precisely the reason why the bombing that took place, the bombings that have been [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  taking place looks exactly like the bombings that took place in the immediate aftermath of October [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  7 before the relentless bombing campaigns before the ground invasion, because Israelis are fucking [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1238.08s)]
*  cowards. Okay. They are the most cowardly diaper brigade on the fucking planet. The only the only [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1245.6s)]
*  enemy combatants that they could kill are fucking children in cribs. Okay. And even then they do it [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  by lobbing missiles from airplanes. That's it. This is why calling this a war is fucking [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  ridiculous. Israel is a belligerent occupier on the Gaza Strip. It's not a war when you get the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1263.12s)]
*  control all of the fucking supplies. It's not like state versus state violence. Okay. What holy [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1267.68s)]
*  shit you and tariff news and you tariff news what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke by phone [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1274.5600000000002s)]
*  with Prime Minister Netanyahu and told him that the Trump administration is concerned about the [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1281.1200000000001s)]
*  humanitarian situation in Gaza. How is this any different than what Biden has been fucking saying? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1283.92s)]
*  So yeah, excuse me if my words actually frustrate you when I say fuck Israel. Okay. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1287.92s)]
*  Fuck Israel and fuck anyone that defends Israel. Okay, they are doing a live streamed Holocaust. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1294.8s)]
*  And anyone, especially at this point, that still tries to fucking defend any piece of this is a [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1303.6799999999998s)]

*  that later. Israeli news outlets reported Friday that no breakthroughs that occurred in Doha this [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdLmdfF6Xc&t=1317.4399999999998s)]
