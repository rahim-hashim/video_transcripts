# Will US-Iran Make Nuclear Deal? | HasanAbi React
**HasanAbi:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM)
*  He's not wrong. He's not wrong. I mean, he is wrong with his weapons of peace. That's not correct. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=0.0s)]
*  But yeah, in this day and age, if you don't have a nuclear arsenal, you're cooked [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=7.76s)]
*  because other nations with nuclear arsenals will come. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=14.4s)]
*  Let's look at the direct plans on the Iran nuclear deal. Donald Trump, once again, at first, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=23.2s)]
*  undermining Barack Obama and then rebuilding Barack Obama. Once again, let's see. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=29.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is in the mood for a deal. What is this? Don't worry. What the top she say [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=34.72s)]
*  you little, what'd you say again? Come after, come after me is one thing. Don't worry. Even with 104% [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=42.24s)]
*  terrorist, our teachers are still cheaper than what this Greek Arab sells. Yeah. Okay. Listen up, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=48.72s)]
*  okay. My products at ideology.shop as a matter of fact, are made in the United States of America. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  Okay. And they're made with union manufacturing. You don't like it. You can one. All right. How [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=60.88s)]
*  dare you? They probably will still be impacted by terrorists to some degree, because every part of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=67.84s)]
*  manufacturing still touches the globalized economy. But I don't know. We'll see in the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=72.64s)]
*  Oval Office, Timid Benjamin Netanyahu sat next to the president as he announced that the US will [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=80.16s)]
*  hold high level talks with Iran. We have a very big meeting and we'll see what can happen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=91.92s)]
*  In his second term, President Trump has repeatedly signaled his desire to secure a deal with his [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=99.52s)]
*  Iranian rivals. For weeks now, the US and Iran have been exchanging a series of messages and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=104.64s)]
*  letters to resume talks. And if they don't, the message or menace from Donald Trump is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=110.64s)]
*  Iran will be in great danger. The talks will mark a return to diplomacy after the same. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=117.2s)]
*  I'm confused. You know, like Jon Stewart. No, I do. It's just that I see no reason to have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=124.0s)]
*  Jon Stewart say the exact same things I've been saying in perpetuity for 15 minutes with a laugh [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=130.64s)]
*  track over it. Donald Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal signed by Barack Obama, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=135.92s)]
*  instead opting for a maximum pressure campaign that reinstated US sanctions negotiations. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=142.0s)]
*  But that hasn't seemed to work. In response to the US sanctions, Iran has since breached restrictions [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=148.64s)]
*  that were designed to limit its production of uranium. The nuclear watchdog warned that Iran [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  has stockpiled 275 kilos of uranium and if enriched to 90 percent, that could be enough [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=160.48s)]
*  for six nuclear bombs. The US and Iran will hold the indirect talks in Oman this Saturday. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=167.84s)]
*  The busiest man of the Trump administration, Steve Witkoff, will lead the US delegation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=174.88s)]
*  Iran will be represented by their foreign minister who says the ball is in America's court. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=180.32s)]
*  But are you okay? If the other side shows real intent, we believe a deal can be struck. So as [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  the saying goes, the ball is in the US court. If they show up in Oman with genuine willingness, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=192.08s)]
*  we'll certainly reach a result. But the world has changed. Iran can no longer rely on the threat [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  of deterrence from its regional allies Hamas and Hezbollah. And after 18 months of turmoil in the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  Middle East, Iran's supreme leader and Donald Trump both know that this is an opportunity [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=209.68s)]
*  to de-escalate, as they say, or not. Well, we're joined now by Dr. Ali Vaz, the Iran [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  project director at the Security Think Tank Crisis Group. Thanks for coming back on the program, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  Ali. What do you think Donald Trump really wants out of all this? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  It's good to see you, Matt. I think President Trump has the right instincts on Iran. He [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  understands that there is really no military solution to the- [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=238.56s)]
*  I don't know anything about this guy. But there are any analysts that speak on Iran [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  that will talk about Iran on normal terms. So I don't know, maybe he will be one of those- [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=249.84s)]
*  Nuclear challenge with Iran. And a deal is much less costly and much preferable. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=255.36s)]
*  I think he also, from an ego perspective, he believes that the Iranians are master negotiators. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=261.04s)]
*  And if he can outwit them at the negotiating table, it will be the ultimate test of his mastery [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=267.92s)]
*  of the art of the deal. Is it also about containing Israel and the possibility of probabilities [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=273.6s)]
*  at some stage of a military solution to the Iran problem, as they would call it? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=280.88s)]
*  Well, correct. If indeed Iran is now a- Check CNN. Check CNN. They're teasing your [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=288.48s)]
*  piece soon. Check CNN. Get off your telephone. Oh, bro. You're on CNN soon. This guy is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=295.6s)]
*  literally been saying this for a week now. And I highly doubt it. Okay. I highly, highly, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  highly doubt it. Yeah. They're talking about IRS, multiple senior IRS officials refuse to sign data [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  sharing agreement with immigration authorities. They are not f**king teasing my piece at all. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=313.92s)]
*  This guy is like, Oh, my cousin works at Nintendo. That's what he's been saying. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=318.0s)]
*  No sussy. My cousin said it's going live soon. I, they didn't reach out to me, which is terrifying. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=322.0s)]
*  And I don't think this person is being for real. Yeah. I think this cousin is either f**king with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=330.24s)]
*  them or something. I don't know. Poopsog incoming. PermaBan if lying. Yes. Ban him if wrong. Yes. I [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=336.16s)]
*  will do that. Hassan's dump truck viewer is untrustworthy. No way. Okay. To be fair, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=343.6s)]
*  to be fair, a lot of you have crazy names. Oh, you missed it. I missed what? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=349.92s)]
*  CNN, non Nintendo, Caposita, tiny head in Spanish. Okay. It's not going to happen. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=356.8s)]
*  True nuclear weapons state, meaning that it is really one screwdriver, uh, turn away from [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=364.24s)]
*  being able to weaponize its nuclear program. Um, part of the reason it is at this point is because [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  president Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement. What if he's writing is the most [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=375.84s)]
*  deranged hit piece of all time? I hope not. And in his first time, uh, and that removed the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=380.4s)]
*  restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. Um, from the Israeli perspective, it appears that the real [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=386.56s)]
*  problem is not uranium enrichment in Iran, but Iranian enrichment. Any deal that benefits the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=392.0s)]
*  Iranian regime is not attractive for Israel. Uh, but again, the alternative to no deal is an [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  advanced nuclear program that Israel or the United States cannot tolerate. Uh, and I think [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=404.88s)]
*  president Trump is right in pursuing a diplomatic solution. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=410.4s)]
*  So the Iranians have been quite coy about these talks. Presumably what they're hoping to get out [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=415.6s)]
*  of them is that the sanctions will be lifted and their economy can get up and running again. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=420.32s)]
*  Well, that's right. Um, but the Iranians are also very mistrustful of the United States because [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=427.76s)]
*  president Trump withdrew from, uh, the previous nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=432.4s)]
*  And they've also seen some other deals that you've made, uh, with other countries, uh, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  where he has also moved the goalposts and, uh, and, and, and, and either has abandoned or reneged on, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=443.44s)]
*  uh, U.S. commitments under those deals. Um, so they are, uh, reluctant. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=449.52s)]
*  Uh, also here is based Papa John Mersh upholding the immortal science of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=455.68s)]
*  Marxist Leninist, Hassanist doctrine, also known as the nuclear doctrine. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=462.8s)]
*  Let's hear what he had to say about Iran having new. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=468.24s)]
*  I think there's no question that a nuclear armed Iran would bring stability to the region [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=472.0s)]
*  because clear weapons are weapons of peace. Uh, they're weapons of deterrence. They have [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  hardly any offensive capability at all. And if Iran had a nuclear deterrent, there's no way that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=483.84s)]
*  the United States or Israel for that matter would be threatening to attack Iran now in the same way [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=490.8s)]
*  that if Saddam had had in 2003, the United States would not have invaded Iraq. And if Libya had [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=497.12s)]
*  weapons in 2011, the United States would not have gone to war against Libya. Uh, so I think that if [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=504.96s)]
*  you had a middle East where other States besides Israel, and this of course includes Iran, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=512.96s)]
*  had a nuclear, he's not wrong. He's not wrong. I mean, he is wrong. We said the weapons of peace. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=519.44s)]
*  That's not correct. But yeah, in this day and age, if you don't have a nuclear arsenal, you're cooked [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=525.2s)]
*  because other nations with nuclear arsenals will come and just gear shit up. I mean, Ukraine, dude, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=533.6s)]
*  look at Ukraine. Look at Ukraine. Even liberals understand that. I think it would be a more [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=540.64s)]
*  peaceful region. Well, it's possible there'll be some proliferation. I wouldn't bet against the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=548.88s)]
*  fact that maybe Turkey or Saudi Arabia would acquire, but people have been predicting [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=554.4s)]
*  widespread proliferation for decades now and it's never happened. But I think there are two reasons [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=558.9599999999999s)]
*  that it wouldn't happen. One is that the Iranians would not be able to blackmail anybody in the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=564.56s)]
*  neighborhood with their, we've created this myth in this country over the past few years in talking [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=570.16s)]
*  about Iran, that any country that acquires can blackmail other countries or for offensive [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=575.28s)]
*  purposes. We have a lot of theory and he don't forget the age old Hassan Abiy doctrine recently [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=580.24s)]
*  updated rule one, get nukes Hassan Abiy doctrine, a guy for nation building rule one, get nukes rule [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=586.48s)]
*  two, do not give up the nukes rule three. If you're accused of having nukes drop everything [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=594.64s)]
*  immediately and find some nukes. The rest of these are, the rest of these are just, you know, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=603.04s)]
*  silly stuff. The updated rule four, do not fly in a helicopter rule five, do not swim in deep ocean [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=610.88s)]
*  water or go spelunking rule six. If a defense contractor or purges you to provide assistance [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=617.68s)]
*  disband immediately rule seven. If all else fails, get ready to learn Chinese buddy [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=623.68s)]
*  rules four through seven are also other rules that I have and abide by, but that's, this is revisionist [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=630.88s)]
*  like they, these, these are like hadiths. Okay. They added these after this is not like in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=638.0s)]
*  original, this is not OG Quran. Okay. They just added these later down the line. You know, yes, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=644.2399999999999s)]
*  I often have moments of wisdom and it's understandable that you would look at that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=652.24s)]
*  and, and add new texts, but this is not a part of the OG. This is not in the OG suras. Okay. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  Rule six, if a defense contractor approaches your providers, this is disband immediately. Oh, that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=666.88s)]
*  is simple. Yeah. If someone says I'm here from the United States of America and I'm here to help you, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=671.52s)]
*  okay. I'm here to help you. You got some goals that are aligned with our nation. Okay. You have [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=678.88s)]
*  some goals that are aligned with America's interest in the region. Just drop it. Just drop it. Be like, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=684.96s)]
*  nah, things are so much better. Actually, sorry. You're making fun of four and seven as if one to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=691.12s)]
*  three are totally serious. Yes, they are. Yes, they are. And to be fair, four to seven are serious [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=697.76s)]
*  too, but one to three are the most serious in the absence of a denuclearization from the United [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=704.8s)]
*  States of America and all the other nuclear superpowers on the planet. Every other country [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=710.64s)]
*  has to get nukes ASAP. And what's even funnier, what's even funnier is what is this? I held down [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=715.28s)]
*  my cousin screwing around. She works at CNN where Hassan Abih has much loved all check last message [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=724.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay. I believe you. Now, one thing I will say is this. One thing I will say is this. A lot of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=729.68s)]
*  people will say, Hassan, these nations are unstable. These nations are unstable, except there's only one [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  country on the entire planet that has ever actually dropped not one, but two nuclear weapons [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  on a civilian population. And that country is the United States of America. So out of all of the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=758.08s)]
*  nations with nuclear programs, there's been nuclear testing, there's been weapons testing for sure, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=765.68s)]
*  but only one country has ever been insane enough to deploy said weapons on a civilian population. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=772.64s)]
*  Okay. That country also, after doing that, has actively entertained the notion of dropping nukes [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=781.28s)]
*  on numerous occasions, including nuking China and also Korea. So just understand that if there is a [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=789.12s)]
*  unstable nation that cannot be trusted with nukes, it is us. It is the United States of America. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=798.48s)]
*  Okay. We're the only fucking goddamn country that has ever used nukes. So it's really funny [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=805.76s)]
*  when motherfuckers would be like, Hey man, what if Iran gets a nuke? What if they use it? It's like, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=810.72s)]
*  what do you mean? What if they use it? We used it. We are the one country that used it. We're also [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=814.96s)]
*  so hilariously bad in like, we're bad in a way where we would mythologize like the incompetence [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=822.08s)]
*  of the USSR. We're also as far as I know, one of the handful of countries that has actually [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=828.48s)]
*  accidentally lost nukes. Not once, not twice, but I believe on four different occasions. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=834.48s)]
*  So there's that part of the process too. We have quite literally also kept nukes that have [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=841.84s)]
*  no protection whatsoever. So much so that activists like Greenpeace activists and shit [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=849.04s)]
*  who have infiltrated said facilities. That is how ridiculous this fucking country is. So please, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  please don't tell me what would happen if a country like Iran, a dangerous, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  unstable nation got nukes. What then? What would happen then? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=867.68s)]
*  A huge amount of empirical evidence 67 years now would show that no country with nuclear weapons [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  can blackmail another country as long as somebody is protecting that country or it has its own [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=878.7199999999999s)]
*  nuclear weapons. And this leads to the second reason. The United States is going to extend [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=884.0s)]
*  its nuclear umbrella over Saudi Arabia and over Turkey the way it extended it over Germany and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=888.72s)]
*  Japan during the Cold War. And we will make it perfectly clear to the Iranians that they [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=894.4s)]
*  cannot blackmail anybody. So there'll be no great incentive for Turkey or for Saudi Arabia to acquire [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=898.88s)]
*  nuclear weapons. And as you know, when you're involved in contact sports, it can be very [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=906.48s)]
*  dangerous. And so they live in a dangerous world. And on top of that, nuclear weapons are the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=911.0400000000001s)]
*  ultimate deterrent, right? It doesn't get any better. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=916.64s)]
*  As a resident of Japan, I feel the strongly I get what you're saying, but banning all nukes [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=920.0s)]
*  starting with America is important as a message to get out. I mean, I, yes, I of course agree with [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=922.88s)]
*  that. You know, that's not I'm not in favor of nuclear proliferation. I'm in favor of [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  denuclearizing the planet. Obviously, it's fucking insane. Speaking of nukes, one of the funniest [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=933.68s)]
*  and saddest things that ever happened was when the famous anti-nuke activist guy from Japan who [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=941.2800000000001s)]
*  like survived the atom bombs, who's like seen as a figure for peace, came out and spoke out against [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=948.6400000000001s)]
*  Israel's genocide in Gaza, saying that Gaza resembles Hiroshima. Israel got mad at him [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=958.6400000000001s)]
*  and said he was anti-Semitic. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzju4JxNYkM&t=966.08s)]
