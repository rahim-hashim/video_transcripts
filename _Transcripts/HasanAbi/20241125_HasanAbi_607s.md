# Joe Rogan Blasts Zelensky And Warns Of WW3! | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q)
*  I just feel safer knowing like... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Pull this microphone. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=1.8s)]
*  I feel safer knowing that Trump is in office. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=3.36s)]
*  I do too. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=6.72s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=7.76s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=9.24s)]
*  I feel great about it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=11.4s)]
*  I just like... [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=13.0s)]
*  What I don't feel safer is right now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=13.84s)]
*  they're launching missiles into Russia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=14.88s)]
*  That's fucked up, yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=17.04s)]
*  How are you allowed to do that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=17.88s)]
*  when you're on the way out? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=19.44s)]
*  Like the people don't want you to be there anymore. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=20.44s)]
*  This should be like some sort of a pause [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=21.92s)]
*  for like significant actions [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  that could potentially start World War III. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=26.52s)]
*  Someone in the chat saying he's a... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=29.32s)]
*  He's the producer of Lean Back. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=31.28s)]
*  His name is Scott Storch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=33.04s)]
*  He's a famous legendary music producer. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  Okay, glad that you know, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  we got the top intellectual minds on this case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  They're gonna fix... [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=42.2s)]
*  They're gonna fix the Russia situation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=43.6s)]
*  Maybe that would be a good thing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=45.52s)]
*  that we would like to avoid from a dying former president. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=46.8s)]
*  The whole thing is nuts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=51.84s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't know shit about politics. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=53.0s)]
*  Zelensky says Putin is terrified. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=55.28s)]
*  Fuck you, man. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  Fuck you people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=58.56s)]
*  You fucking people are about to start World War III. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  Like people say I'm pro-Russia for my criticisms of like [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=61.96s)]
*  some of the actions that Ukraine has taken on in this process. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=67.88s)]
*  But like, fuck you mean? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=73.44s)]
*  Like what are they supposed to do, brother? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=76.64s)]
*  Like it's not, he's not wrong. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=77.64s)]
*  No, I think that, I think once again, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  this is entirely in the hands of the United States. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=81.88s)]
*  But of course, never, never... [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=84.68s)]
*  Americans who are jingoistic and Western chauvinist [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=89.68s)]
*  always discount America's influence in this process. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=93.92s)]
*  Okay, they'll only do it when they're doing it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=99.56s)]
*  on like partisan lines to turn around and say like, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=102.04s)]
*  oh, Biden is such a fuck-old for doing this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=105.0s)]
*  Like fuck you people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=107.6s)]
*  When they're talking about like Ukrainians. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Listen, Ukrainians understandably have a right [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=111.48s)]
*  not only to defend themselves, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  but to rid their borders of a Russian invasion, okay? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  But if the situation on the ground is untenable, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=121.68s)]
*  the way I analyze everything is how like America's actions [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  in this process, allowing Ukraine to strike [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=129.6s)]
*  into Russian territory, for example, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  will this actually deescalate? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=133.96s)]
*  Will this actually be able to give Ukraine [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=136.76s)]
*  more of an opportunity to push back the Russian annexation? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=141.0s)]
*  Or will it not? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=148.28s)]
*  I don't think it's, I don't think it's, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=149.2s)]
*  I don't think it's the Ukrainian people's fault, man. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=153.72s)]
*  I feel like there's a more responsible party here, you know? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=160.72s)]
*  Russia fired a missile today. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  They fired an intercontinental ballistic missile [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  for the first time ever. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=165.92s)]
*  It's the first time one of those has ever been used. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=167.2s)]
*  It's insanity, because those intercontinental [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=170.56s)]
*  ballistic missiles can have on them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  This one didn't, but if it does, the whole world changes [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  and it changes because of the military industrial complex [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=178.56s)]
*  and it changes because of the money that's going to Ukraine [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  and it changes because the outgoing president [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=183.72s)]
*  or whoever the is actually running the country [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=186.08s)]
*  is decided to do something insane, insane. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=187.96s)]
*  And we're all sitting there watching it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=193.52s)]
*  and people are cheering it on. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  CNN was saying. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=197.4s)]
*  Is it possible that you can talk about Romania's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=198.44s)]
*  heading candidate, which is pro-Russia [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=200.6s)]
*  and anti-Semite plus supports legionary movement? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=201.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck is going on in Romania, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=204.48s)]
*  but we'll dive into it in a little bit. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=207.04s)]
*  Like finally, see what their headline was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=209.24s)]
*  about Zelensky using, about Biden giving Zelensky [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=212.04s)]
*  the ability to use long range missiles. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  US made long range, it's not like nobody knows [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=218.32s)]
*  where they came from. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=221.24s)]
*  It's not like nobody knows we've been funding this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=222.24s)]
*  It's a proxy war. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  The whole thing is fucking insane. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=225.24s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  Come to the negotiation table, sit down, work this out. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Stop killing everybody. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=231.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think the real responsible party that is, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=233.72s)]
*  is Zelensky internally has, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=237.27999999999997s)]
*  has as obviously internal pressure from people [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=240.48s)]
*  to the right of him that want him to never entertain [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=244.32s)]
*  any sort of ceasefire prospect. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=248.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=250.83999999999997s)]
*  But if America was like, hey, we got to pack this shit up [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  because Donald Trump is going to be [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=257.0s)]
*  significantly more devastating, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=258.16s)]
*  then Zelensky alongside China and Russia [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=260.08s)]
*  would come to the ceasefire negotiation, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=263.32s)]
*  would come to the table to broker some kind of agreement. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=265.64s)]
*  The issue still, I think the problem still here [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=269.2s)]
*  is America's involvement, that they don't give a shit. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=273.04s)]
*  They don't give a shit about Ukrainian emancipation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=276.72s)]
*  They don't give a shit about like, Ukrainian is not dying. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=278.84s)]
*  And I'm willing to bet that they don't even care [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=282.36s)]
*  if Ukraine gets fucking fucked. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=284.36s)]
*  That's a dangerous prospect. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=287.96s)]
*  It's something that I noticed early on when, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=290.0s)]
*  like I said, John Kirby very clearly was like, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=292.76s)]
*  yeah, if they use it, it's going to be a baby. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=297.2s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=300.68s)]
*  You're a horrible person. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=301.52s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=302.36s)]
*  That's all they said? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=303.2s)]
*  I unbanned them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=304.08s)]
*  I don't think this person is going to actually respond [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=305.28s)]
*  with what, you know, took place in their minds at least. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=307.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=311.64s)]
*  Why'd you ban? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=312.64s)]
*  I unbanned them because I want to see [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=313.48s)]
*  what the fuck they have to say. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=314.96s)]
*  I think so that I can be helpful. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  But I think the mods did the right thing by banning them [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=319.4s)]
*  specifically because they're not helping themselves. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=321.76s)]
*  I think they're just mentally ill. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=325.32s)]
*  They banned them because they don't want that person to, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, that person that's probably going through [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  a mental health episode to say stuff [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  that puts them in the crosshairs unfairly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=336.4s)]
*  US allows Ukraine to use long-range missiles. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  So what did they say? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=342.2s)]
*  Someone had said that like CNN was saying [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  that it was a good thing, which I think is how? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=346.68s)]
*  How has the left gone so far crazy [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  that they think it's a good thing to launch missiles? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=353.48s)]

*  as a possible security guarantee for Ukraine, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=369.56s)]
*  such as stockpiling a conventional arsenal [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=371.6s)]
*  sufficient to strike a punishing blow [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=373.44s)]

*  That would be an instant and enormous deterrent, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=384.4s)]
*  but such a step would be complicated [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=386.8s)]

*  I feel like this might not be the best time [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  to offer Ukraine nuclear weapons, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jydivYam_Q&t=403.24s)]
