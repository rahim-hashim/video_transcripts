**HasanAbi:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA)
*  Okay, I think in order to maintain some some semblance of soul in art in cinema in every artistic expression [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=0.0s)]
*  We have to collectively agree never to hear from [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=10.86s)]
*  dipshits like this ever again, okay, I [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=15.040000000000001s)]

*  Don't want to hear the opinions of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=23.8s)]
*  the dumbest person [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=26.38s)]
*  Oh [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=30.8s)]
*  I've watched this I've watched one battle after another the trailer multiple times at this point looks so amazing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=33.04s)]
*  I don't even know what's going on [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=39.8s)]
*  Like it's one of those trailers where you're like, I'm more confused entering [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=42.64s)]
*  I'm more confused leaving the trailer than I did entering the trailer, but [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=47.36s)]
*  You know, that's another here. We'll start off with this one. This is crazy [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=52.980000000000004s)]

*  Maybe you should have studied the rebellion text a little harder. I need to find my daughter [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=106.84s)]
*  Well, then call us back when you have the time [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=111.8s)]
*  As much as a gross dude Leo is he such a good actor. Yeah, he really is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=115.12s)]
*  I think the uglier he's gotten over the years the better. He's becoming as an actor, too [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=120.48s)]
*  It's like kind of crazy. I don't know how but the uglier he gets the better he gets like a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=126.88s)]

*  My child comes from a whole line of revolutionaries [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=149.48s)]
*  And you look so lost [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=154.0s)]

*  When I saw this I was like that looks for like for a brief moment [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=190.76s)]
*  Unless you pause on it you realize it's not but for a brief moment doesn't it look like it's Tony Hawk [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=194.68s)]
*  Like if you just glance past it I thought it anyway, whatever [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=200.44s)]
*  Not one thing. It's not true [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=206.12s)]
*  Benicio del Toro is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=208.8s)]

*  Just I don't know. Yeah god [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=221.88s)]
*  There's something about Benicio del Toro where I feel a sense of comfort when I see him on on the silver screen [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=224.32s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=230.2s)]

*  Carpet roll [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=253.88s)]
*  Cario of course, dude, are you kidding me? It's a classic [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=259.36s)]
*  Anderson's one of the reasons Tarantino try harder with his last movies. This feels like Wes Anderson trying to make a Tarantino movie law [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=263.32s)]
*  What are you talking about? No, it doesn't feel like that at all. I completely disagree with you [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=269.84s)]
*  Anyway shot on this division. I think this is I mean look [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=275.36s)]

*  That's how I feel about it. Anyway, I'm very very very very excited about this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=284.56s)]
*  And I think it'll be it'll be super sick [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  You're unconscious one watch there will be blood and shut the fuck up the music [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=294.48s)]
*  I mean the score sounds incredible just from the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  Just from the trailer the beats look fantastic [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=304.08s)]
*  I like that. It's a maybe not a political [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  Who knows I'm emotional [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=313.08s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, it's gonna be good with the budget is so high [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=315.4s)]
*  They're gonna call it a box office flop and then use it as a reason to not give artsy films big budgets [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=318.94s)]
*  The Twitter post had a bunch of people calling the movie woke. Yes, I think for the sake of humanity [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=323.36s)]
*  So that we can continue advancing humanity [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=329.96s)]
*  We should collectively decide to never listen to people like that ever again [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=333.14s)]
*  Okay, I think in order to maintain [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=339.5s)]
*  some some semblance of soul in art in cinema in every artistic expression [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=343.06s)]
*  We have to collectively agree never to hear from dip shits like this ever again. Okay, I [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  Don't care. I don't care. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear what like I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=357.98s)]
*  Don't want to hear the opinions of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=363.3s)]
*  the dumbest person [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=365.86s)]
*  So who's the proud person in the background of geese pushing all these stories to be written about non-slop movies and TV losing money [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=367.86s)]
*  There's clearly a campaign going on here and probably big money behind it [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=373.7s)]
*  Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio is 130 million plus one battle after another will need to make at least [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=377.22s)]
*  260 million to break even a top source says the film [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=382.94s)]
*  Was tested in at least three markets of recent months and a consistent no came up audiences struggled to root for any of the characters [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=386.14s)]
*  The Capri has been praised for a quirky performance according to the testing a character played by Benicio del Toro scored high civil [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=391.76s)]
*  Of course Benicio del Toro with one played by Sean Penn also indexing high Anderson reported dude [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=397.54s)]
*  I don't want to say what I think should be done [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=403.38s)]
*  For people who have this opinion. I don't want to say it because I will get banned and right now [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=407.3s)]
*  I think at a time when right wing commentary is going to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=413.22s)]
*  Explode on this platform for one reason or another. I don't think I should get banned but [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=417.98s)]
*  like this kind of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=425.06s)]
*  analytical [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=427.7s)]
*  Quantitative approach to an otherwise a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=430.02s)]
*  Qualitative product is so [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=435.18s)]
*  fucking annoying [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  just make a movie and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=440.66s)]
*  Let it ride. Okay, I don't I hate it. I hate it [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=444.02s)]
*  This is the one thing that like all of the dipshit studio heads back in the day [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=448.44s)]
*  Still cared about okay. They literally cared about to a certain degree making art [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=454.9s)]
*  Maybe I have like nostalgia goggles on but like no matter how big of an asshole a studio head was [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=460.54s)]
*  He still cared about like the output of the studio now. Everyone is like is this gonna get people to watch it? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=466.62s)]
*  Let's read. Let's let's juggle some IP here. Let's let's uh [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=473.46s)]
*  Let's like gender swap existing IP. Okay, let's race swap gender swap existing IP. That'll be good [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=478.22s)]
*  People will watch it. It'll do well in certain demographics and certain markets is like stop even a 24 [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=484.5s)]
*  which supposed to be like the one the one place where this doesn't happen is like moving in the in the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=490.78s)]
*  Moving in a slopped direction. You know what? I mean? I just I hate it this paired up with the Apple [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=497.66s)]
*  With the Apple TV shit is has been frustrating [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=503.86s)]
*  Okay [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=507.58s)]
*  Everything is the Democratic Party now Hollywood is so lived up that they have become the Democratic Party [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=509.46s)]

*  Hopefully the movie just lets Leo act and isn't trying to make some political point with the plot [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=543.94s)]
*  I you know what's crazy about this. I think these people know we think less of them and I think they don't care [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRFoPL91GA&t=547.82s)]
