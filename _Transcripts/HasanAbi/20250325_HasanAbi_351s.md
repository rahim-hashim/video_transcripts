*  And it's all it's filled to the brim with pro has on comments. I couldn't believe it. OK. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=26.94s)]
*  We're back baby. We're back. This is a super this is my first ever debate at Politicom [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=32.06s)]
*  with Charles Jebediah Kirk. You know before he became a prominent Trump administration [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=37.82s)]
*  figurehead. Yeah man. Let's let the ableist rhetoric run rampant. I'm sure that's great [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=45.06s)]
*  for everyone. Dude I can't tell you what I think should be done about Governor Greg Abbott. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=51.78s)]
*  I can't. OK. I think like ableist rhetoric is the least consequential thing in that situation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=59.900000000000006s)]
*  OK. There are dudes and ladies and non-binary people in this chat and wheelchairs being like [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=69.02000000000001s)]
*  yeah no he's Mr. Hot Wheels. That guy like what are you talking about. So many people [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=75.18s)]
*  Jebediahs and middle names. Yeah. Stop conceding to Republicans on issues that they objectively [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=80.46s)]
*  don't care about. Not a single Republican like Republicans not only do not care about the optics [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=89.66s)]
*  of ableism. OK. They literally want to melt disabled people. OK. They want to melt disabled [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=97.58s)]
*  people. They want to turn them into bio matter. And you're over here being like well this disabled [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=104.94s)]
*  Republican governor of Texas who unironically shut off access litigation access to other disabled [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=108.54s)]
*  people after he won a fat lawsuit when a tree fell on him. Ironically enough that guy you can't you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=115.58000000000001s)]
*  can't make fun of him like shut up. Yes it's fine. You're you're stupid like you're you're [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=124.06s)]
*  just being ridiculous if you are using any space any opportunity any moment to just be like yeah [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=130.06s)]
*  this was a bridge too far. Yes these people are being mean. OK. I love trees by the way [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  unrelated to the situation. All right here let's I mean here's another here's here here it is here [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  it is here. Look so. Peacefully protested took a knee. How is he doing that. You can't do that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=148.54s)]
*  Then on the streets if they protest on the streets it's not acceptable if they protest [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  peacefully it's not acceptable. It seems like you just don't want them to protest because I [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=165.02s)]
*  didn't hear you yelling at tea party people. Do you think people have a right to protest. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  Or do you think people should only protest when it's things that you're in favor of. No I'm OK with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=181.9s)]
*  this. It doesn't seem like it. So when you start interrupting a speaker and pulling the fire alarm [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=186.62s)]
*  and throwing objects that's something wrong with that. That's funny but yeah there is something [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  wrong with that. OK. That's what I'm talking about. You're making a straw man argument about [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=197.18s)]
*  something. I believe that everyone has a right to protest peacefully. I see that you're creating [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=200.86s)]
*  this as long as they're not calling. No you could say as long as they're not the 30 students in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=205.18s)]

*  Colin Kaepernick for disrespecting flag but then applaud the January 6 posse. Let's face it sometimes [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpfCZUGMiBQ&t=223.34s)]
