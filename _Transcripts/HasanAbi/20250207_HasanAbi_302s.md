**HasanAbi:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g)
*  Oh, is he going to say he's going to suit? I see implying he's going to sue denims for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=0.0s)]
*  violating his cut out, please. That's insane. He's like up and down the timeline begging [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  for people to watch the video because it's so damning. And now he's implying that he's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=13.1s)]
*  going to hit a copyright strike. That's crazy. No, wow. No accessibility settings on the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=18.0s)]
*  house. And I rock us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=22.96s)]
*  Can you please address the criticism here? What is this? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=29.8s)]
*  Dream and talks at the same time. Okay, but that's based. You're just based for that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=32.8s)]
*  Like you're literally just based. Okay. What? Like you're right about that. And you should [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=35.92s)]
*  say it and we should all keep saying it. And he should stop pulling a Kamala by saying [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=41.92s)]
*  I am speaking. Sorry. We should keep saying it. I don't know what's going on here. Maybe [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=48.72s)]
*  if, maybe if enough of us push him, he will stop doing it. Okay. What? Maybe great clip [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=56.16s)]
*  that cuts off the initial context. Yeah. There's criticism here, but I don't even know what [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=65.8s)]
*  it is. Denims on his song speaking with his mouthful. Yeah. I'm not going to stop. Yeah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=70.48s)]
*  I will never stop eating on stream and I will never stop speaking with my mouthful. You [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=75.48s)]
*  know, she said you stole the shelves. Wait, what do you mean? You got to blame my mom [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=80.44s)]
*  for that. Nothing. They're saying that they're saying that another content creator has the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=85.26s)]
*  same exact shelves behind her. And I'm saying that you are responsive. Yeah. My mom is the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=89.54s)]
*  one who bought them and, and chose them. My mom is a big Denim's head. I think that's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=95.98s)]
*  why. Oh yeah. That's the person who had the shelves. Yeah. Yeah. My mom, my mom can't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=102.66000000000001s)]
*  even figure out Twitch to watch me. Okay. So your voice stops the room from spinning. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=108.98s)]
*  Okay. Nice. Did you see the new Hassan? I've a head species just dropped the way my rabbit [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=113.98s)]
*  doesn't give a damn about me. One of his favorite show. The Hassan broadcast is on. Oh my God. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=118.94s)]
*  I know that I have this aura on cats. I didn't know that it also existed for rabbits as well. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=123.54s)]
*  That's so funny. I'm sorry, Sam, but is it possible to see that pick with your giant [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=136.46s)]
*  dog up close somehow? I can't stop looking at it, but it's too far away. And I'm curious [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=142.76s)]
*  if it's painted or computer generator or whatever. Do you have it posted somewhere? Maybe it's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=146.68s)]
*  painted and no, there's no way that I can take a picture that is framed a painting that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=150.56s)]
*  is framed on my wall and bring it up closer to you. My cat sends your cat hating aura [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=157.6s)]
*  and sit in front of my screen all the time. When I'm watching you, they want me to stop. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=162.28s)]
*  It's really an awful noise though. I legit have to turn you off when you eat. Not saying [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=165.74s)]
*  you should stop eating on stream, but like, could you at least try to eat away from the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=168.52s)]
*  mic? Mesa phonia is a real thing, dude. Yeah. Um, me is my answer to that. And the reason [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=170.84s)]
*  for why I say me is because I have the greatest strongest noise gate in the game and you very [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=179.6s)]
*  rarely ever hear noises. So, you know, that's it. That's literally it. Yes. As I can watch [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=185.76s)]
*  the video now, what is this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=194.04s)]
*  And it'd be a shame if somebody was, well, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=196.04s)]
*  Oh, is he going to suit? I see implying he's going to sue Denims for violating his cut out, please. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  That's insane. He's like up and down the timeline, begging for people to watch the video because [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  it's so damning. And now he's implying that he's going to hit a copyright strike. That's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  crazy. No, wow. No accessibility setting on the house on our broadcast. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=220.36s)]
*  Sure. Sure. Sure. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Sure. Okay. So Hassan definitely should not watch his nuke then. Right. We were all in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  agreement. Hassan should not and apparently cannot watch his video because Ethan Klein [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  doesn't like people violating his copyright. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=246.52s)]
*  Hassan. Wait, was this like a big five head move? Is the big five head meta was that like [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  I watch it and then he hits me with a copy strike. Like what is happening? Anyway, I [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=259.92s)]
*  don't know. I don't really care. I've moved on from this. I hope everyone else can as [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=265.12s)]
*  well. Eventually. Who knows? Ethan going anti-fair uses a real Federman move. Oh my God. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Did he also, did he also get hit with a stroke that makes you more pro Israel than you were [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=277.52s)]
*  prior? He didn't move on. I mean, I'm moving on. I'm moving on once again, and I hope he [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=282.76s)]
*  can move on as well. And you know, that's it. I don't know what else to say. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55SlRPinx6g&t=289.79999999999995s)]
