# Unveiling The Truth Behind The Ceasefire Agreement | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY)
*  like stories exactly like this one for the record, I'm not discounting that these people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=0.0s)]
*  have their own personal stories and their personal upbringing and their, you know, and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=5.4s)]
*  the role they play in the lives of those who love them. Okay. But I also want you to understand [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=11.28s)]
*  that like each individual Palestinian has the exact same story as well. So [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=17.16s)]
*  before we get to some less serious news, like the hostage deal that Benjamin Danielle was [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=28.04s)]
*  trying to cook once again, in the same way that he tried to do in the same exact way [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=32.36s)]
*  that he tried to do to Joe Brandon, we'll see how Trump responds to this. I forgot what [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=36.92s)]
*  I was going to say. Nevermind. He's halfway to that dumb predictive future gamer body [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=41.4s)]
*  archetype less serious. Yes. I don't know if you understand this, but I'm joking. Like [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=45.64s)]
*  that was a joke. Like obviously this is significantly more serious than gamer drama. That's like [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=51.92s)]
*  not even that's sarcasm. One-on-one dude. That's crazy. Like that's a crazy thing to assume [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=58.1s)]
*  bro thought jokes would fly. That's crazy. Yeah. They're going to be reporting on, they're [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=64.02s)]
*  going to be voting on it tomorrow morning. I know. And, and yes, I'm familiar with the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=70.26s)]
*  Zin FDA approval. Finally, we won the Zinfidels one something. And also don't worry. I will [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  be covering David Lynch's passing as well. Very important figure for the arts. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=81.3s)]
*  News overnight, a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is still in place, but there is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=87.78s)]
*  at the very least a new delay this morning that everyone is trying to get a better handle [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=95.06s)]
*  on what it really means. Here's what we know at this hour. Israel's cabinet needs to vote [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=99.42s)]
*  to ratify the deal that has not happened as it was expected to Israel delayed it, citing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=104.58s)]
*  last minute issues. Again, what this now means exactly for the phased in ceasefire [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=111.08s)]
*  and hostage deal. It's unclear. It's all supposed to begin on Sunday under the deal. Hamas has [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=117.36s)]
*  agreed to release 33 hostages in the first phase is really agreed to release a thousand [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=122.44s)]
*  plus Palestinian prisoners. All of that resulting in a 42 day ceasefire with hopes it leads [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=127.36s)]
*  to a permanent one. Let's get to CNN's beyond a goal. Wow. Maybe now the media will report [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=133.88s)]
*  on what's going on accurately. I wonder who the responsible party is for messing up the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=140.22s)]
*  ceasefire negotiations. Once again, I wonder if it's Hamas or if it is for the 15th month [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=146.32s)]
*  in a row, Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition. I wonder who is after like the eighth time [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=156.06s)]
*  that they've actually signed off on an agreement. It seems strange to me. I wonder who is the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=165.06s)]
*  responsible party. She's live in much more on this. Bianna, help us understand what is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=170.54s)]
*  the status here? What is the latest? Okay. Good morning to you. So all of these things [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=177.54s)]
*  remain rather fluid, but the latest it does appear to be just a delay in the process of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  getting a security cabinet and ultimately a party cabinet vote in the government here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=188.02s)]
*  As you noted, Prime Minister Netanyahu blaming Hamas for what he says is reneging on parts [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=194.48s)]
*  of the deal. Hamas for their part are denying those allegations. Everyone I'm speaking with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=200.48s)]
*  here still believes though that a ceasefire deal will go into place as had been agreed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  upon beginning Sunday night where we would see the first hostages in phase one of those [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=211.88s)]
*  33 released here to Israel. Hospitals have been on standby and ready to receive those [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  hostages. In terms of the politics of it all, Prime Minister Netanyahu is facing a lot of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=225.36s)]
*  headwinds as we've been reporting now for months from the far right element specifically [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=231.96s)]
*  of his government, of his coalition who do not want to agree to a deal under these terms. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=237.32s)]
*  The latest we have is that finance minister Betul El Smotrich has said that his party [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=243.04s)]
*  would agree to stay with the coalition through phase one of the deal. That is the release [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=248.76s)]
*  of those 33 hostages and the pause in fighting only if the fighting would be allowed to proceed [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  again after phase one. So there you just get a sense of how fluid and fragile this deal [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  is right now. But Kate, when it comes to the hostages coming home in phase one, as you noted, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=268.28s)]
*  it would be the women, it would be children, it would be men over the age of 50 and those who [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=274.68s)]
*  are critically wounded. And among those women are five IDF spotters, our soldiers. Reminder that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=280.44s)]
*  everyone in Israel is required. Israeli military members are still considered hostages, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=287.48s)]
*  but Palestinian civilians, 10,000 of them are considered prisoners, which is again, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=296.76s)]
*  double speak for the record. Like I just so you understand it. So it's a part of manufacturing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  that same exact consent that, that the media routinely engages in, right? Like we're talking [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=308.2s)]
*  women and children, women and children that have been falsely detained by the Israeli government. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=315.64s)]
*  They're being considered as prisoners. The numbers are like 10,000 at this point. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=321.08s)]
*  I am required to serve in the military. These five IDF spotters, all young, the ages of 19 to 21. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=327.0s)]
*  I spoke. Yeah. These children who also are generals, by the way. Yeah. Look, you don't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=334.44s)]
*  understand. These guys are all young. They're just spotters. They're just spotters. Like, no, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=339.64s)]
*  they're a part of the military. They're a part of the military. That's currently engaging in a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=343.64s)]
*  cleansing campaign. Like that's crazy. They're not, they're not hostages in that regard. They [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=348.68s)]
*  would be prisoners of war. With the cousin of one of them, that a gum burgers cousin, she is 20 years [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=354.04s)]
*  old. I spoke with her cousin about what this moment may feel like for them when they are finally [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=361.0s)]
*  reunited and why there's a bittersweet sense in the country right now. She's a beautiful young girl [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=366.92s)]
*  who's been 15. Like stories exactly like this one for the record, I'm not discounting that these [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=372.44s)]
*  people have their own personal stories and their personal upbringing and their, you know, and the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=378.36s)]
*  role they play in the lives of those who love them. Okay. But I also want you to understand that like [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=384.92s)]
*  each individual Palestinian has the exact same story as well. So remember what the media in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=390.92s)]
*  the Western world especially pays attention to and how they treat Israeli occupying force soldiers [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=398.28s)]
*  that are held captive versus the thousands of women and children that have been falsely [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  imprisoned in perpetuity by the Israeli government in the maintenance of an apartheid [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=412.84s)]
*  and how they get presented. This framing is very important because it reinforces the humanity [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  of each individual Israeli and it actually reinforces the dehumanization of each individual [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=428.28s)]
*  Palestinian. Your hatred of Israel blinds you. What point do you feel like I am blinded? Like [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=437.4s)]
*  what do you think? What do you mean by that? Because I already said that of course every [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=443.96s)]
*  single Israeli that's being held captive is a human being with lives and loved ones, okay, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=450.35999999999996s)]
*  that miss them. Okay. I get that. I understand that. But do you think that each individual [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=455.8s)]
*  Palestinian that is in the same exact predicament, if not worse predicaments overall in terms of like [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=462.12s)]
*  legal permissibility in terms of international human rights and Israel's routine violation of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=468.36s)]
*  that at the behest of maintaining an apartheid state? Is your argument simply that I hate Israel [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  and that's why I recognize Palestinians as humans? Perhaps I wish to run into you one day in the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=481.56s)]
*  street and break both of your kneecaps Hassan Piker says Zander Macha. Good luck, brother. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=487.88s)]
*  Good luck on that. Not all of us agree with our government. Wait, what? I never said that. What [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  are you talking about? I've never said that all Israelis 100% agree with their government. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=498.6s)]
*  You just made that up. Also the person who said this, you will not be doing that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=503.88s)]
*  You won't be doing that at all. As a matter of fact, if anything, if you were to actually see [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=508.84s)]
*  me out in the wild, okay, you would probably behave like a fan and try to get a photo and say [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=513.4s)]
*  how much you actually appreciate my commentary. You wouldn't, you wouldn't dare to try to behave [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=519.72s)]
*  in the way that you claim that you would at most you would be in a discord server talking about how [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=525.64s)]
*  you were going to quote unquote troll me and how much you were pissing your pants in that moment. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, once again, going back to this other chatter, not the one who wants to [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=535.72s)]
*  break my kneecaps or whatever. I've never, I don't maintain this position. I don't know why [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=539.08s)]
*  you think I've said this. Does it make it, does it make you feel like it's a better argument that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=544.2s)]
*  you can present? Is that what it is? You know, I'll wait for your response. But a lot of this [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=549.64s)]
*  conversation basically devolves into that. Like the notion that Palestinians are not human and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=554.36s)]
*  only Israelis are the real humans in this equation. Palestinians are faceless, lifeless, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=559.5600000000001s)]
*  hive-minded parasitic forces that are constantly threatening the existence of the real humans in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=565.24s)]
*  the region, the only people in the region. Okay. And many people's primary assumption is that, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=572.2s)]
*  and they just operate off of that. You know what I mean? So much, if you were to potentially, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  if you were to potentially go back as an Israeli, completely support better future for the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=586.52s)]
*  Palestinians, people and their families, they are people just like us is important to, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=589.64s)]
*  it's important. You remember that many of us do. Yeah. Except I do know that. Okay. I don't know [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=592.8399999999999s)]
*  if, you know, your perspective is, is commonly shared because there are, you know, there is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=598.52s)]
*  polling conducted inside of Israel regularly where, you know, many Israelis agree with the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=606.3599999999999s)]
*  consistent genocide, the offensive genocidal siege that Israel has implemented. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=613.4s)]
*  The Israeli occupying force is implemented on the Gaza strip. But having said that, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=619.48s)]
*  if you were in here long enough, you'd recognize that I talked to my Israeli chatters with regular [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=625.0s)]
*  frequency. And I even talked to members of the Knesset and even talk to conscientious objectors [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=630.36s)]
*  and rely on Israeli sources of investigative reporting with regular frequency once again. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=638.36s)]
*  So just so you understand, there are plenty of Israeli chatters in here right now in this [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=643.72s)]
*  community. I'm probably one of the only places where they have access to even watching the likes [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=649.16s)]
*  of Al Jazeera, for example, since your government banned it anyway. But yeah, having said that, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  this is not a, you know, you're, you're arguing against the thing that I don't believe. Let's [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=659.4s)]
*  continue. Months in the hands of people that we know committed the worst atrocities against women [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=665.4s)]
*  in one day. We know what they did on October 7th. We also know from released hostages who came home [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=672.04s)]
*  what they did to hostages in captivity. That's the biggest fear. The physical aspect of it, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=677.4s)]
*  and I don't need to go into detail. I think everyone who's watching understands [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=683.48s)]
*  what that fear means, but more importantly, the mental and emotional aspect of what kind of trauma [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=687.3199999999999s)]
*  something like that can do to a young girl who's 20 years old, who has her whole life ahead of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=693.8s)]
*  her. All right. Bianna Golodriga for us in Tel Aviv. Bianna is going to be all over it. A lot of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=698.28s)]
*  developments could be coming on this today. David Sanger, let me start with you. You of course have [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=702.6800000000001s)]
*  been covering this deal closely. Is there anything to this last minute hiccup with the Israeli? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=707.32s)]
*  I thought you'd been the kneecap dude. No, I mean, I'm not afraid of it. And I'm sure [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=713.4s)]
*  you're issuing a direct threat to the streamer as a site wide ban anyway. So [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=717.96s)]
*  I suspect that regardless of whether or not I banned that person, they probably will get banned [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=723.48s)]
*  across the board from Twitch permanently. Yeah. See very stupid thing to do. Honestly. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=727.56s)]
*  We're going to talk about the reporter that was dragged away from the state department briefing [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=734.12s)]
*  in a second cabinet. How serious is that here? It could be, we don't know yet. I do know that [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=738.36s)]
*  up to the last few hours before they announced the agreement yesterday, Casey, Hamas was coming up [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=744.76s)]
*  with sort of last minute things they were putting on the table. It's a very usual technique on their [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=751.16s)]
*  part. And the question is, can that be put down? This is just an alternative reality. They are [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=757.08s)]
*  existing in a totally different plane of existence. Okay. It's completely, I mean, simply put, this is [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=763.16s)]
*  just a lie. Okay. That's it. It's just a lie. You're in opposite world. It feels as though [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=771.4s)]
*  you are just lying and going along with what the state department has said over and over again, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=779.3199999999999s)]
*  in spite of what people can see with their own two eyes, right? It's such a weird thing to do [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=787.56s)]
*  over and over again. When like it's the easiest thing to disprove the notion that it's actually [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=792.84s)]
*  Hamas that's ruining these ceasefire negotiations and not Israel is ridiculous. It is completely [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=799.88s)]
*  made up. It is the exact opposite. I cannot stress this enough. And we have shown numerous examples [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=806.2s)]
*  time and time again, the narrative being pushed today by Israel's Hamas is reneging on the terms [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=813.88s)]
*  of the Gaza agreement, but as it has been from the start, it is actually Netanyahu. The prime [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=818.52s)]
*  minister's office announced on Thursday morning that the idea of would not withdraw from the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=822.28s)]
*  Philadelphia quarter during the first phase of the hostage deal on Thursday morning, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=824.92s)]
*  contrary to misleading reports, Israel's not withdrawing from the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=828.28s)]
*  Israel will remain in phase a in the quarter for an entire 42 day period. The statement said [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=832.68s)]
*  the scope of forces will remain at its current size, but will be deployed differently, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=837.24s)]
*  encompassing outpost patrols, observations and control along the entire corridor. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=841.64s)]
*  So they won't let the Rafa border open. Okay. They won't let Gaza and Egypt take control over [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=845.24s)]
*  their own borders, which is a non-starter for understandable reasons. If you still control [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=852.04s)]
*  the humanitarian aid that's going into the Gaza strip through the Rafa cord, through the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=858.36s)]
*  Philadelphia corridor, through the Rafa border, you're not withdrawing. You're not retreating [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=862.1999999999999s)]
*  at all. The scope of forces will remain at its current size, but would be deployed differently, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=867.4s)]
*  encompassing outpost patrols, observations and control along the entire corridor during phase [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=871.16s)]
*  a starting on the 16th day negotiations will begin on ending the war. If Hamas does not agree [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=875.3199999999999s)]
*  to Israel's demands for ending the war, achieving war's objectives is will remain in the Philadelphia [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=879.4s)]
*  corridor on the 42nd day and consequently beyond the 50th day. In practical terms, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=883.56s)]
*  Israel will remain in the Philadelphia corridor until further notice. The statement concluded [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  now this right here is unacceptable for understandable reasons. This is not a cessation [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=892.6s)]
*  of hostilities. This is not a ceasefire. And I'll give you evidence to the, I'll give you [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=897.88s)]
*  evidence to understand if you are still confused by this process. It's like Vladimir Putin saying, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=903.24s)]
*  no, you don't understand. We are still going to maintain true presence along virtually every part [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=908.6s)]
*  of Ukraine. Like we're going to shut off Ukraine from Poland and many other bordering nations. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=914.52s)]
*  And we are going to maintain true presence to ensure that we completely encircle Ukraine. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=922.2s)]
*  Now, of course, screens, a much larger country. And it's not like a, a, a concentration camp that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=927.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel has maintained for the past 76 years. So obviously it's virtually impossible militarily [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=933.96s)]
*  to even do such a thing, but like it is ridiculous. If Vladimir Putin was like, no, you don't understand. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=939.16s)]
*  Like we are going to literally do that. Everyone would say, yeah, that's insane. You are not, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=943.64s)]
*  that is not a cessation of hostilities at all. Okay. What's Trump's play? Just pretend Israel's [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=949.48s)]
*  acting in good faith and take the W. I mean, I don't think he can, I don't think he can get [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=954.84s)]
*  away with it just like Biden couldn't get away with it. So who knows? We'll see. We'll see how [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=958.68s)]
*  Trump differs from Biden on this. At least he understands who he's supposed to be pressuring [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=962.92s)]
*  in this regard. You know what I mean? So far with the way that the negotiations have, have actually [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=967.7199999999999s)]
*  moved. And I don't know if there's a carrot and a stick where the carrot is basically, you can go [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=974.28s)]
*  back to bombing Gaza or annexing the West bank later down the line. But, you know, and the stick [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=978.76s)]
*  being, if you don't, if you don't actually pull the ceasefire before my inauguration, I'm going [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=985.88s)]
*  to literally stop giving you weapons. But one thing remains clear. If you want to understand [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=991.4s)]
*  the truth of the matter, it is obvious that it's not Hamas that's ruining the ceasefire negotiations. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  They have said yes to this since July 2nd. Okay. It is the same. It is a version of Trump warns [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1008.4399999999999s)]
*  Israeli officials against restarting hostilities in Lebanon, reports the Jerusalem post. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1015.8s)]
*  Crisis between Israel and the U S Trump warns against collapse of Lebanon ceasefire exclusive [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1022.36s)]
*  source close to the U S president. Like Donald Trump have reportedly conveyed a stern warning [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1026.2s)]
*  to Israeli officials. Israel since last night have increased their bombings and targeting [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1029.4s)]
*  of civilians according on a ground press. They're telling civilians to be even more [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1043.56s)]
*  careful than usual. Yeah, no, I know. I know that that could be two different things though. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1046.28s)]
*  That could be because Israel always increases hostilities before the last second of the ceasefire, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1053.0s)]
*  which is gross, but that is expected. What are you jealous? As men goals, getting a bunch of cloud of [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1060.76s)]
*  Elon's weekly EB number 84. Why would I be jealous of that? I personally love that they're beefing. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1066.36s)]
*  I covered it earlier. It was awesome. I don't care about the quote unquote clout that as mingle gets [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1073.64s)]
*  out of it. I already covered it. It was great. I'm a fan. It's free viewers. I mean, okay. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1079.24s)]
*  That's a very weird and cynical way to approach the subject matter from your perspective. In any [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1084.3600000000001s)]
*  case. Yeah. More people recognize that Elon Musk is a fraudulent narcissistic, thin skinned man [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1090.04s)]
*  child is good in my book. It's a okay. Anyway, you can not convert them brother. Read the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1098.12s)]
*  Shahada. So much swab. What? I have no idea what you're talking about. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1104.76s)]
*  But the bigger question is who's right under in this dispute between the two. And the answer is [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1109.72s)]
*  really both. So the deal is essentially what president Biden laid out in may. It also, you may [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1115.8s)]
*  notice this is January. So, you know, that deal did not happen. And I think the fact that they did [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1122.92s)]
*  link up so well and that Steve Witkoff, who was president Trump's incoming Mideast advisor, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1129.5600000000002s)]
*  was out there in lockstep with Brett McGurk, who was president Biden's equivalent for that. And [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1137.0s)]
*  has worked for Republican presidents as well. I think that made the difference because they were [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1142.44s)]
*  able to go to Netanyahu, send Witkoff and say, this is the deal that Trump wants. And I think [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1147.16s)]
*  that sort of helped put it over the marker. David Tom Malinowski, who's a former Democratic [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1152.84s)]
*  congressman, he put out a very interesting thread on Twitter, the first of which says that this was [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1159.56s)]
*  Biden's deal. But as much as I hate to say it, he couldn't have done it without Trump. Not so much [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1166.12s)]
*  Trump's performative threats to Hamas. Yeah, I mean, yeah, Hamas is already under maximum pressure. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1170.76s)]
*  Okay. It's called, you know, being genocided. There is no more pressure that you can put on [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1177.72s)]
*  Hamas than genocide. Okay. You're genociding the Palestinian population in its entirety. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1183.8s)]
*  There is no more pressure in that regard. That's the maximum thing that you can do. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1191.0s)]
*  The difference here is Trump actually went to the responsible party and applied pressure to the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1195.72s)]
*  responsible party. Also, why would you want to pressure? How would you pressure Hamas on a deal [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1201.48s)]
*  that they have presented since May, a deal that they signed off on since July? It makes no sense. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1207.24s)]
*  Trump didn't do shit. Everyone's gullible suddenly. Hello. Wait, what? No, you have to understand. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1215.16s)]
*  You have to understand Trump did do things, most likely very bad things. Okay. But in the interim, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1221.64s)]
*  something that had to be done, which was to apply pressure to Benjamin and Yahoo's side. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1229.56s)]
*  And that's the only reason why Israel was like, all right, we're going to vote for this. We're [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1234.52s)]
*  going to, we're going to pass the ceasefire. But now Benjamin and Yahoo's going back on it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1237.96s)]
*  The situation right now, if Jay posts is right, Trump told BB he'd let Israel violate the ceasefire, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1243.16s)]
*  keep sending arms and lift sanctions to on extremist slash settlers. Despite these guarantees, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1247.64s)]
*  BB still refused to sign the ceasefire publicly says he wants to effectively nullify it by changing [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1251.88s)]
*  its terms to keep troops in Gaza until Hamas surrenders and lies about Hamas sabotaging it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1256.92s)]
*  The ball is in Trump's court now. Exactly. No, I don't. I mean, I don't disagree with this. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1260.92s)]
*  I agree with this. I agree with this. It's entirely dependent on what Trump does from this point on [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1266.04s)]
*  until the inauguration. Will he actually hold Benjamin? It's also entirely dependent on the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1272.1200000000001s)]
*  ceasefire. The, the accepting whether or not Israel will accept the ceasefire, we'll find out tomorrow. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1278.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. Or in a couple hours, like, you know, I guess like 12 hours or so, but what you have [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1285.88s)]
*  to understand here is that Trump's pressure that led to Benjamin, any, I was saying he was going [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1292.68s)]
*  to sign off on this that led to Joe Biden coming out and saying, the deal is done. Israel actually [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1297.88s)]
*  signed off on it is yet another instance where is yet another instance where like someone, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1302.6000000000001s)]
*  some additional factor applied extra pressure for this conversation to move. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1311.32s)]
*  Okay. Now, does that mean that weapons transfers were on the table? I don't know, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1316.12s)]
*  but your phrasing makes it seem like Trump personally does something and cares. No, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1322.68s)]
*  I've never said that Trump cares about Palestinians. I've always maintained the position [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1325.8799999999999s)]
*  that Donald Trump does not care about Palestinians and most likely cut a side deal, which you know, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1330.04s)]
*  I have, I'm speculating that he most likely cut a side deal with Benjamin and Yahoo, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1334.84s)]
*  whether it be permanent annexation of the West bank or whether it be even in the interim period, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1339.08s)]
*  a potential to throw the ceasefire negotiations aside. But the problem here is that outside of [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1343.6399999999999s)]
*  that outside of that side deal, there was definitely additional pressure applied. Now we'll see [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1351.48s)]
*  if that pressure worked. Okay. If that pressure worked, we will see come tomorrow. But the only [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1357.08s)]
*  thing, the only thing in this equation that was new was basically Donald Trump and Witkoff, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1365.48s)]
*  Witkoff appearing as for Donald Trump. But his willingness to tell BB bluntly that the war had [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1371.16s)]
*  to end by January 20th. And he essentially goes on to say that while Biden did a great job working [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1378.52s)]
*  with European leaders, he did not bring the sort of thuggery to the table that is required in the [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1385.16s)]
*  Middle East. Do you think Malinowski is right about this? I think he's absolutely right. And [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1391.72s)]
*  the reason that I would say that is first of all, the relationship between President Biden and [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1396.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is poisonous would be a polite phrase for the for the term. Okay. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1401.24s)]
*  And no, this isn't Trump's deal. This isn't Biden's deal. This isn't Israel's deal. This is Hamas's [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1407.8s)]
*  deal that Hamas presented in the early stages of February and then openly presented in May. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1412.76s)]
*  The deal that Biden put forth in July 2nd that that seemingly everyone was in line with [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1419.88s)]
*  that Biden presented as Israel's very own deal is the exact same deal. Okay. Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1427.8s)]
*  throughout this process has added additional poison provisions into it in an effort to continue [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1434.36s)]
*  bombing Gaza in an effort to refuse to negotiate. If you want to cut this deal, it requires one [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1439.4s)]
*  singular phone call, not a phone call to Hamas envoys, a phone call to Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1445.88s)]
*  I've been saying this for months, saying this for months. The party that is ruining this deal [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1451.5600000000002s)]
*  and refusing to, refusing to abide by it is not Hamas. It's Benjamin Netanyahu. It's Israel. And [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1457.88s)]
*  the, and the reality of the matter is it's not even an exact comparison to Ronald Reagan [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1465.96s)]
*  because Reagan was dealing with foreign adversaries, not with Israel. Okay. You don't [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1471.48s)]
*  understand. That's what makes the situation so much worse for Joe Biden in terms of how [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1477.72s)]
*  he chose not to deal with the problem and only escalated because Israel would not exist without [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1483.24s)]
*  our unlimited support, without our unlimited political cover and without our unlimited weapons [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1490.6s)]
*  transfers. Israel would run out of bombs a week in, okay. Maybe a month maximum. I have repeated [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1496.92s)]
*  this true fact over and over again for the past 15 months. Okay. But unfortunately the way that [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1505.8000000000002s)]
*  the media covers this is so built on top of this falsehood that they are repeating from the state [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1513.5600000000002s)]
*  department that there's numerous reporting to suggest is completely incorrect. Okay. That [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1520.76s)]
*  people just simply cannot comprehend that it is Israel that is the spoiling party. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1528.2s)]
*  So therefore it is Israel that you have to apply pressure to. And in this case you have endless [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1535.0s)]
*  amounts of power to apply pressure to Israel. Endless amounts of power. Because Israel is our [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1541.32s)]
*  colonial vestige. Israel is our weapon to wield in the region. That's it. That's what makes it so [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1548.52s)]
*  much worse for Biden, especially because Biden tries to maintain or Democrats try to maintain this [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1554.92s)]
*  like aesthetic that they are peace lover but simply are held up and they can't get both sides to agree [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1559.96s)]
*  to this ceasefire negotiation when in reality it's not both sides that aren't agreeing. It's [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1569.32s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu that's not agreeing. Second, the fact that they were able to send Wipkow, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1573.56s)]
*  not Brett McGurk but Wipkow on Saturday to see Netanyahu and say President Trump wants this [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1581.8s)]
*  resolve before Inauguration Day in part so that it's not on him to go be the one who was squeezing [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1590.52s)]
*  the Israelis. I don't think the Israelis would have made the deal. I think they would have [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1598.9199999999998s)]
*  just said well let's just see what we get out of Trump. Interesting. Mike Dupke. Well first on a [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1602.44s)]
*  serious matter what's amazing to me is America matters. I mean that's the at the end of the day [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1607.72s)]
*  what other country we can have this argument about Trump or Biden but what other country can step [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1615.56s)]
*  into an international conflict and really have the level of influence that we did in this. So to David's [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1620.52s)]
*  point I mean America matters. On that more of a lighthearted side I'm sick and tired of these two [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1626.92s)]
*  arguing about golf scores. I'm sick and tired of these two arguing about who mattered. The fact that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1632.28s)]
*  these two gentlemen got together told their people to get this done that's what's important here. I [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1637.72s)]
*  wish they would just both take the victory and be happy that we have a ceasefire after all these [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1643.64s)]
*  months. Yeah. Hima what do you make I mean obviously President Biden we have seen clearly doesn't is [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1649.0800000000002s)]
*  not ready to exit especially the world stage. You know it's it's. I don't know. I mean I can't see [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1653.8s)]
*  this as anything but just like people lying in the most reddit. You know the reddit phenomena that I [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1660.44s)]
*  talk about all the time which is like sometimes you'll see someone like basically comment something [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1665.1599999999999s)]
*  that is completely incorrect and then there's like 11 subsequent comments replying to that making [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1670.52s)]
*  jokes about that lie. But we've now established that lie as like the truth and people are just [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1677.0s)]
*  circle jerking around this like abject lie. That's precisely what's happening on CNN this morning [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1683.56s)]
*  with Casey Hunt. Like not a single person on this this panel is going hey guys it kind of doesn't [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1690.04s)]
*  make sense that this deal looks identical to the deal that Hamas presented. It kind of doesn't [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1696.04s)]
*  make sense that like for the past I guess 15 months or at least for the past eight months [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1701.48s)]
*  Biden has claimed that this is his deal even though initially he said it was Israel's deal [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1706.9199999999998s)]
*  and Israel itself never actually agreed to its own deal. Like what are we supposed to make of this. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1712.2s)]
*  It's like not that complex. It's not that complex at all. Many people can see the truth in this [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1717.0s)]
*  regard. So I don't know what purpose this serves in terms of just like still in this final hour [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1723.3200000000002s)]
*  these guys are still operating on this false notion that it's actually the pressure that must be [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1732.5200000000002s)]
*  applied to Hamas because they're just not willing to agree to the terms of these [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1738.04s)]
*  willing to agree to the ceasefire negotiation. It doesn't make any sense. All you're doing is [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1743.48s)]
*  trying to I guess use the the crumb of credibility that you have still with like 90 year olds into [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1749.56s)]
*  believing a false notion into believing something that is patently untrue that you can openly see. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1757.96s)]
*  It's so strange. It's definitely strange especially happening at a time when obviously [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1764.28s)]
*  like mainstream media has lost so much credibility. A place that he has always really you know he's [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1771.32s)]
*  valued his role as even when he was in the Senate and he was on the Foreign Relations Committee [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1776.44s)]
*  he clearly doesn't want to give all the credit to Donald Trump but I will say the people that [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1782.36s)]
*  work for him have been willing to do it. Yeah look I agree with Mike. I think people across the country [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1787.56s)]
*  are sick of the back and forth. I think people want to see some bipartisanship and so for the [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1792.76s)]
*  start of this new administration I think this is a good sign that there could be some glimmers of [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1797.72s)]
*  hope for bipartisanship but secondly look I think President Biden and Vice President Harris have been [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1802.12s)]
*  clear about their stance on this and they've worked very hard to get here and so yes I do think Donald [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1807.24s)]
*  Trump helped push this over but I don't want to take the credit away from the President the Vice [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1811.96s)]
*  President. They were very clear about this deal. They're very dogged about it. They wish this would [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1816.76s)]
*  happen in May but it did not but I think you're right President Biden's having a hard time this [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1820.6s)]
*  week. He has a couple of days left in office. He's enjoyed being president. It was not his choice to [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1824.28s)]
*  not be president. Let's just be honest about that but it's going to be tough for him as he watches [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1828.1999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump take office again. Remember when he took office a couple years ago he wanted to save [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1832.36s)]
*  this country's soul. He doesn't really feel like he's done that so I do think there's some things [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1837.08s)]
*  that he's grappling with over the next couple days that are going to be tough for him. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1842.4399999999998s)]
*  David one thing that has hung over this deal is of course if assuming that that this stays on track [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1845.56s)]
*  and we see these hostage releases on Sunday is going to be the imagery and the parallels for an [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1853.72s)]
*  outgoing President Biden with an outgoing President Carter. Let's Jimmy Carter reflected a little bit [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1859.32s)]
*  on this dynamic back in an interview he did in 2015. I want to watch that and then we'll talk [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1866.28s)]
*  about it. I hadn't been to bed for three days and three nights. I had just been negotiating with [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1870.92s)]
*  the Iranians and with 12 other countries to get this release of our hostages who had been in prison [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1876.28s)]
*  for more than a year and at nine o'clock that morning they were already in the airplane ready [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1883.64s)]
*  to take off from Tehran but the eye told how many kept them there until after I was no longer [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1889.88s)]
*  president. And your colleague Peter Baker in his analysis mentioned that this was has been hanging [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1895.16s)]
*  over the I mean this is something the White House is very aware of the president's aides have been [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1899.96s)]
*  very aware of. How does this kind of echo today? Well first of all this could well spill into Monday [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1903.4s)]
*  it could spill beyond Hamas at various moments made the argument they weren't certain where all [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1909.56s)]
*  of the hostages were. The second reason that this may hang over is the great thing about the Jimmy [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1915.56s)]
*  Carter tape that you showed there is all the hostages walked off the plane and here we know [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1921.88s)]
*  of the numbers that we're hearing not everyone is alive and some of those hostages are going to [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1929.96s)]
*  come back as remains and so this is going to be both joyous and soul crushing at the same moment [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1936.44s)]
*  and it's also going to make you wonder had the deal been able to come together earlier [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1945.08s)]
*  how many of those lives could have been saved? The Israelis claim Hamas reneged on parts of [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1950.28s)]
*  the ceasefire deal Hamas officials say it isn't true this comes amid the backdrop of internal [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1955.8s)]
*  political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Here's Trey Yankst who is [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1959.96s)]
*  the chief foreign correspondent for Fox News reporting on the matter. I'm sorry but the fact [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1965.3999999999999s)]
*  that like the fact that Trey Yankst at Fox News is saying this from Tel Aviv and he is outflanking [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1971.48s)]
*  CNN is so unacceptable okay. This is an important update there is a crisis as it relates to the [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1979.56s)]
*  ceasefire agreement reached last night the Prime Minister's office here in Israel just released a [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=1986.28s)]

*  cabinet vote until mediators inform Israel that Hamas has agreed to all parts of the deal this is [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2002.36s)]
*  significant and it comes amid the backdrop of increased domestic political pressure against [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2008.68s)]
*  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu whose own finance minister Betzalel Smoltrich [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2013.5600000000002s)]

*  something different the Israelis claim Hamas reneged on parts of the ceasefire deal Hamas [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2036.76s)]
*  officials say this isn't true why didn't he mention that in the did I yeah he didn't mention that at [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2040.84s)]
*  all he tweeted it this part does not exist in the video interesting anyway if Netanyahu's [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2046.36s)]
*  government is starting to dissolve it then who is that it is reneging on it it's so dumb I know [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2053.32s)]
*  that's what's so frustrating about it it's like it's so glaringly obvious it is so obvious who the [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2058.76s)]
*  spoiling party is I saw a tweet from 2012 on the timeline earlier someone had brought it up again [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=2065.56s)]

*  good question there from matt lee a legend in that building from the associate press talking [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=3311.96s)]

*  change at this point um because saudi arabia is essentially saying that if we're going to normalize [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=3356.36s)]

*  so [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4560.28s)]
*  dude it is so crazy that somehow somehow we arrived at an administration that's filled to the brim [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4565.88s)]

*  and the losers that we arrived at zero news made in kjp's final briefing she had no details on the [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4635.64s)]
*  ceasefire hostage deal that will end up for and 400 days of fighting a defining element of biden's [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4640.84s)]
*  presidency is that a directing reporters to an nsc background call sources familiar with the [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4645.72s)]

*  keep the spotlight on herself maybe it's because like despite trump trump's weakness i think [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4652.76s)]
*  trump's weakness was his narcissism so that was a major opening for people who could basically [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4658.76s)]
*  you know tell him the right things and and be obviously incompetent for the job like [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4666.280000000001s)]
*  unqualified for the position trump would elevate you to that position that you're unqualified for [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4673.24s)]
*  just because you you know hyped him up right with joe biden it's even worse because joe biden is a [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4677.72s)]
*  husk like it's so obvious that joe biden was a husk so anyone that lucked into any position [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4684.2s)]

*  bringing out even worse self-interested careerists that simply didn't do a good job at all and didn't [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4701.72s)]

*  should have got the job he was more competent for the job but they gave it to her and you see that [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQCgUXwdmCY&t=4730.6s)]
