# Trump vs. Harris: Two Rallies Happening At the Same Time! | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ)
*  I know exactly what your situation is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  People are so funny, they're celebrating a corporate tax rate going down to 15%. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2.0s)]
*  Like it impacts a single one of these people dude. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=4.5s)]
*  Like yeah, this guy, the Jesus is my savior guy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  And the power to do it myself. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=9.68s)]
*  He's like, well, you know, I happen to be a shareholder of Exxon Mobil. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=10.68s)]
*  This is gonna look, this is gonna pay dividends, bro. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=15.48s)]
*  Micron. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=17.98s)]
*  He's gonna be like, what's your answer to the automotive industry's problems? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=23.72s)]
*  Uh, nuclear war. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=27.7s)]
*  Jobs to China, India, Mexico, and it's become more difficult to compete. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=29.46s)]
*  Manufacturers like us, we are some of the largest users of energy and under Harris and Biden, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=36.14s)]
*  the energy costs triple. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=44.04s)]
*  So my question is, what would you do to get energy back down so as us manufacturers can [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=46.08s)]
*  compete and bring it back to the jobs here? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=52.540000000000006s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  So it's a great question. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  A lot of people have the same question because it's affecting their companies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=57.34s)]
*  I just left one, a man from the Netherlands. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=60.62s)]
*  We made a speech, a wonderful guy, and he said the problem was he opened up because of me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=64.18s)]
*  He opened in 2017 and he had three great years. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=69.32s)]
*  And now with them, he's not doing well. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=72.82s)]
*  What we're doing is I said about the energy as to what we do and how we do it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=75.82s)]
*  But China is coming in and you said Mexico. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=81.3s)]
*  Mexico is a big threat now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  Mexico is taking a lot of your business and we're not going to let that happen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=85.16s)]
*  We need a smart series of tariffs and taxes for simple business. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, China won't take cars from outside of China. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=95.56s)]
*  They only take them if you build in China. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=98.68s)]
*  You have to build your factory. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=101.04s)]
*  So if I'm making a car and I think I'm going to sell it into China, they have a massive [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=102.68s)]
*  hundred over a hundred percent. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=107.78s)]
*  Good thing Trump didn't sign like a new version of NAFTA when he was president. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=108.68s)]
*  I'm going to have to build my factory in China. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=112.68s)]
*  And they encourage it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  They help it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  We're going to be doing the same thing, but we're going to do it even better. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  We're going to bring cars back. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=119.74s)]
*  We're going to bring, like you say, what are you, auto parts and things like that, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  We're going to bring that all back to this country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  It's all coming back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=127.58s)]
*  If they had to pay tariffs on what they're doing and what they're selling into our country, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=129.2s)]
*  they wouldn't be putting your business out of business if that's where you're going. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  It will never happen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=139.72s)]
*  And we're going to do it just the opposite. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=140.94s)]
*  Plus, we're lowering the tax rate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=143.04s)]
*  So I took it from 39% to 21%. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=145.76s)]
*  These are for companies and that's why we had the great numbers for jobs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=150.04s)]
*  But now what I'm doing is I'm going, and nobody thought that was possible, and I got it approved [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=154.22s)]
*  by Congress, believe it or not. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=158.32s)]
*  Now we're going to 21, from 21 to 15%. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=160.16s)]
*  But you have to make your product in the USA. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  So if you want to take advantage of the low tax rate, you have to make your product. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=168.4s)]
*  So we'll be down to... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  Fuck it, lower to zero. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=175.62s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=177.1s)]
*  One of the lowest tax rates in the whole world, so it's more than competitive. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=178.1s)]
*  Companies will come here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=182.06s)]
*  But in addition to that, we're going to keep this really terrible competition. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=183.3s)]
*  I don't mind the word competition, but it's predatory. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=188.46s)]
*  And we're going to keep this competition out so that you're able to grow your business [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  and grow it well, and you'll make the product and you'll sell it inside our country. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  And I know exactly what your situation is. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=202.4s)]
*  People are so funny. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=204.4s)]
*  They're celebrating a corporate tax rate going down to 15%. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=205.4s)]
*  Like it impacts a single one of these people, dude. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  Like yeah, this guy, the Jesus is my savior guy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=210.24s)]
*  He's like, well, you know, I happen to be a shareholder of Exxon Mobil. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  This is going to look, it's going to pay dividends, bro. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=218.52s)]
*  We need Mike Rogers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=221.66s)]
*  We need Mike Rogers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=222.66s)]
*  Senator Mike Rogers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=223.66s)]
*  And we've got Lisa McLean, Congresswoman McLean. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=225.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=230.1s)]
*  A warrior. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=231.1s)]
*  Yes, she is a warrior and the amazing, incredible Congressman John James. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=232.1s)]
*  Hey, John. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=238.98s)]
*  14.88. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=239.98s)]
*  Good. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=240.98s)]
*  And they will help us get this done. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=241.98s)]
*  I appreciate that you talked about tariffs. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=245.44s)]
*  And I think it's so important that you continue to call out China and we support you on that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  because we don't want China building those plants in Mexico and then running those cars [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=256.0s)]
*  across the border. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  Without any tax whatsoever and putting everybody here in not only danger, it's over. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  Your union head, I don't know who he is, Sean Fain or something, whoever this guy is. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=272.26s)]
*  In Michigan, they're booing him. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=278.18s)]
*  He sold you out because he let Biden, who doesn't know what he's doing, I mean, you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=279.38s)]
*  probably noticed, he let this guy come up with an all electric mandate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=286.1s)]
*  Those cars are all going to be built in China. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=291.26s)]
*  We want cars built in the USA. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=293.92s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=296.7s)]
*  And they're going to come in at levels. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=297.7s)]
*  We'll be having auto manufacturing at levels that we haven't seen in 50 years. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=300.22s)]
*  We're going to have a lot of companies coming in and we're going to make it competitive [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=306.32000000000005s)]
*  so they can come in and they can thrive. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=310.0s)]
*  Not like this gentleman where they come in and they product and you know what they do. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=312.44000000000005s)]
*  Oh, here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=316.0s)]
*  This is fun. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=317.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris, 2019 president shows border walls and medieval van and folks [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=318.0s)]
*  on the subject of transnational gangs. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=323.92s)]
*  Let's be perfectly clear. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=326.28s)]
*  The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=327.7s)]
*  You know, it's crazy because she was right back then. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  And we know the arguments, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=336.17999999999995s)]
*  The White House and look at that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=338.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris looking through the border wall there down on the southern border. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=339.73999999999995s)]
*  I don't know what specific agency she's with. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=344.78s)]
*  They're probably CDP, Customs and Border Protection. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  The media that is traveling. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=350.02s)]
*  We know the argument. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=353.29999999999995s)]
*  2019 President shows border walls and medieval vanity project 2024 looks up and odd that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  very medieval vanity project. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=358.5s)]
*  God, this country is so stupid, dude. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=360.36s)]
*  We are such a mass country. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=363.48s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=364.76s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=365.76s)]
*  I'm vice president. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=366.76s)]
*  Can you share with the agents that the last stop talks about? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=367.76s)]
*  Yeah, they think they've got a tough job and they need rightly support to do their job. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=370.76s)]
*  They just aren't getting enough support, dude. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  How is this language in any way, shape or form different than what Republicans say about [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=380.8s)]
*  cops and border patrol? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=385.54s)]
*  The real issues with border patrol is that they're simply not being respected enough. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=387.58s)]
*  The real issue with the cops is that they're simply not being respected enough. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  They're not getting enough money actually. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=395.82s)]
*  And that's right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=398.74s)]
*  We're going to give them more money and that's they're going to show these these disgusting, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=399.74s)]
*  barbaric, savage immigrants. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=404.94s)]

*  You're losing Western Europe in terms of your undying loyalty to Israel. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1229.98s)]
*  It is crazy to me that like it is crazy to me that they have just dropped any pretense [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1234.58s)]
*  that like America being the world police is actually like a necessary evil. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1240.22s)]
*  They're just like, no, we're incompetent. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1244.46s)]
*  We're ruthless and we're bad. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1246.18s)]

*  We're getting dog walked by our attack dog right now as it is lashing out at anyone that [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1252.1000000000001s)]

*  We had some time together backstage. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1268.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, I think that in moments of crisis, such as the fentanyl crisis, there are people [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1271.5800000000002s)]
*  who through their suffering and their pain rise with courage in such a selfless way to [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1280.18s)]

*  their story will be the reason other people don't have that story. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1294.66s)]
*  And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1299.5s)]
*  scourge is so incredibly important. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1305.3s)]
*  And again, I applaud Teresa and I know we all do. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1308.1799999999998s)]
*  And our need to stop this issue is one of the reasons that we are all here together [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1310.94s)]
*  today. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1315.4199999999998s)]
*  I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1316.4199999999998s)]
*  Senator Mark Kelly came with me and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1320.86s)]
*  Washington, D.C. to be here. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1327.5s)]
*  And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1329.22s)]
*  this visit. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1335.02s)]
*  And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1336.02s)]
*  Attorney General Chris Mays, who just tore up the floor. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1341.94s)]
*  She is, you know, one of I'm going to talk a bit about it in a minute, but some of the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1346.9s)]
*  work that I have done in my career as attorney general and watching her do the work that [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1353.38s)]
*  she has done as attorney general really does emphasize the importance of having the right [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1359.38s)]
*  leader at the right time in the right place. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1363.7800000000002s)]
*  And that's who she is. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1367.2600000000002s)]
*  Mayor Hewish, I thank you for the warm welcome. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1369.5s)]

*  And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1380.6599999999999s)]
*  out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1385.54s)]
*  Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1389.26s)]
*  I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator, Chris Well, and President Biden and I, of course, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1392.7399999999998s)]
*  will continue to monitor the situation closely. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1398.1399999999999s)]
*  We have mobilized more than 1500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1401.2199999999998s)]
*  impacted. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1407.1s)]
*  We have food, water and generators that are ready for deployment. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1408.42s)]
*  And we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1412.5800000000002s)]
*  And I just want to stress and for the press that is here to those who are watching, sorry, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1422.8200000000002s)]
*  guys, I know we had some money allotted for recovery efforts, but they must go to Israel. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1429.1000000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1435.98s)]
*  So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1437.3s)]
*  until we get past this moment. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1444.54s)]
*  So thank you all. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1447.02s)]
*  And now I'll speak about, in particular, the people who are here today and why we are gathered [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1448.02s)]
*  here together today. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1455.02s)]
*  So Arizona, I think you all know, and this is why you are here, there are consequential [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1457.74s)]
*  issues at stake in this election. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1462.7s)]
*  And one is the security of our border. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1465.3s)]
*  The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1467.18s)]
*  border and to enforce them. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1472.66s)]
*  And I take that responsibility very seriously. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1475.3400000000001s)]
*  We are also a nation of immigrants. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1478.22s)]
*  The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1480.14s)]
*  of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1485.26s)]
*  So we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1491.02s)]
*  it is humane, and that it makes our country stronger. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1498.54s)]
*  So I've just come from visiting the border and the port of entry in Douglas. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1503.14s)]
*  I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs Officers who every day [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1507.1000000000001s)]
*  see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1513.9s)]
*  These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1519.02s)]
*  keep our nation secure. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1524.02s)]
*  And they need more resources to do their jobs. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1526.7s)]
*  Which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1530.42s)]
*  and expand the port of entry here in Douglas. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1535.42s)]
*  And why last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents and also [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1538.74s)]
*  why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1546.66s)]
*  Written last year, written last year as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators, including [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1552.94s)]
*  one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, that bill would have [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1559.46s)]
*  hired 1,500 more border agents and officers. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1564.46s)]
*  It would have paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl, that is tens of thousands [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1570.22s)]
*  of Americans every year. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1577.66s)]
*  It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1579.34s)]
*  And it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1585.96s)]
*  It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1592.04s)]
*  It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union and it should be in effect today. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1596.6599999999999s)]
*  Producing results in real time right now for our country. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1603.62s)]
*  But Donald Trump tanked it. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1608.54s)]
*  He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said stop the bill. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1610.86s)]
*  Because you see he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1616.2199999999998s)]
*  The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1621.1s)]
*  political games and their personal political future. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1627.98s)]
*  And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill, it is my pledge [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1631.9399999999998s)]
*  to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1637.54s)]
*  into law. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1643.02s)]
*  And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1644.1999999999998s)]
*  I was attorney general of a border state for two terms. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1650.1s)]
*  I saw the violence and chaos that transnational organizations cause. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1653.86s)]
*  And the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1659.9399999999998s)]
*  I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1664.62s)]
*  States. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1670.5s)]
*  I've seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1671.5s)]
*  I see it with lighting and air conditioning making very clear that it is about an enterprise [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1677.42s)]
*  that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1684.18s)]
*  And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1690.8200000000002s)]
*  organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1695.74s)]
*  My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1700.42s)]
*  cartels. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1705.8600000000001s)]
*  We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1707.1s)]
*  United States. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1712.4199999999998s)]
*  We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1713.76s)]
*  drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1721.9399999999998s)]
*  pushing opioids with deadly results. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1729.62s)]
*  As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1733.82s)]
*  group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1738.82s)]
*  with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue and in particular to increase intelligence [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1747.82s)]
*  sharing on gang activity. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1754.1s)]
*  All of which allowed us to prosecute. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1756.6799999999998s)]
*  Why you never show Democrat presidential candidates? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1758.8s)]
*  Who the f*** is this? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1761.22s)]
*  A meme? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1762.22s)]
*  The state of California analyzing transnational organizations and the threats they pose to [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1763.6200000000001s)]
*  public safety and to the economy. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1770.78s)]
*  So stopping transnational organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1774.26s)]
*  and it is a long-standing priority of mine. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1779.78s)]
*  I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1782.78s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1788.7s)]
*  And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1791.12s)]
*  across the aisle and I will embrace common sense approaches and new technologies to get [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1797.6799999999998s)]
*  the job done. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1804.6s)]
*  Because I know transnational gangs coming across the border trafficking in guns, drugs [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1806.78s)]
*  and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1812.9399999999998s)]
*  They could care less. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1817.56s)]
*  They've got one goal in mind. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1819.0s)]
*  And it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1821.0s)]
*  work with other leaders for common sense solutions. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1827.1399999999999s)]
*  Understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don't work [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1833.8s)]
*  together to fix these problems. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1840.08s)]
*  And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1842.72s)]
*  innovating. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1846.96s)]
*  So to disrupt them, we must do the same. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1848.3600000000001s)]
*  And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common sense [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1851.52s)]
*  approaches, not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1859.54s)]
*  a problem. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1866.92s)]
*  And as president, I won't only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1868.0s)]
*  tanked, I will do more to secure our border. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1873.1200000000001s)]
*  To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1878.3200000000002s)]
*  between ports of entry. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1884.2s)]
*  Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1886.64s)]
*  reentering for five years. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1892.92s)]
*  We will pursue more severe charges against repeat. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1894.8000000000002s)]
*  And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1899.5400000000002s)]
*  our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1907.3799999999999s)]
*  This is literally 2020 Trump positions. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1912.9s)]
*  That many desperate to migrate to the United States. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1916.06s)]
*  Our system must be orderly and secure. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1919.98s)]
*  And that is my goal. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1924.3s)]
*  And that is my goal. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1925.3s)]
*  Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1927.34s)]
*  Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1934.9s)]
*  The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1937.9s)]
*  So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1944.64s)]
*  I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1948.8600000000001s)]
*  a child to fentanyl. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1956.74s)]
*  And their grief is heartbreaking. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1958.74s)]
*  And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1960.58s)]
*  It's impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1967.26s)]
*  politically or any other demographic you choose to talk about. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1973.02s)]
*  It's a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1977.34s)]
*  And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1980.9399999999998s)]
*  the United States. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1986.62s)]
*  And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1988.1s)]
*  two cartels based in Mexico. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1993.8s)]
*  Most often they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=1996.52s)]
*  Wait. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2003.4199999999998s)]
*  The fact is border officers don't have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2004.3s)]
*  of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2012.1799999999998s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2016.5s)]
*  They need the resources to do their jobs. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2018.3s)]
*  Say the status of the citizenship. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2021.18s)]
*  And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2022.86s)]
*  enforcement agencies on the front lines. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2027.38s)]
*  More personnel, more training and including 100 new inspection systems that can detect [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2030.7s)]
*  fentanyl hidden in vehicles. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2037.66s)]
*  And we will make sure that our ports of entry including airports and seaports have additional [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2040.3s)]
*  state of the art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2046.78s)]
*  I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2053.94s)]
*  organizations and the cartels. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2061.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2063.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2065.22s)]
*  I keep repeating that over and over again. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2066.22s)]
*  Hey, hey, say who's bringing the drugs in. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2068.22s)]
*  Come on, come on, come on. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2071.22s)]
*  Come on, please. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2072.58s)]
*  Say who's bringing the drugs in. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2073.58s)]
*  You're so close to the border entries thing. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2074.58s)]
*  To be much materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2076.58s)]
*  My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2084.22s)]
*  are by and large made in China and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2092.18s)]
*  into the United States. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2098.8599999999997s)]
*  Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2100.2599999999998s)]
*  What happened? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2105.3399999999997s)]
*  And it has started to happen. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2106.3399999999997s)]
*  But they need to do more. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2107.8599999999997s)]
*  And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2108.8599999999997s)]
*  of precursor chemicals coming from China. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2114.74s)]
*  In all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2119.06s)]
*  Because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2125.46s)]
*  It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2131.82s)]
*  hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2140.86s)]
*  And on this issue writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2148.46s)]
*  Which includes fixing our broken immigration system. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2155.46s)]
*  And let me be clear. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2159.1s)]
*  I reject the false choice. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2160.18s)]
*  I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2161.64s)]
*  or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2169.96s)]
*  We can and we must do both. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2175.64s)]
*  We must do both. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2177.46s)]
*  And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2178.46s)]
*  And we must make our current system work better. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2186.14s)]
*  For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2190.54s)]
*  Well this is a problem we can solve. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2196.82s)]
*  Including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people's home [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2199.26s)]
*  countries. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2206.46s)]
*  And as president, I will work with Congress to create at long last a pathway to citizenship [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2207.46s)]
*  that are worthy immigrants like them for years. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2214.94s)]
*  Why is that not on the right wing border bill that was supposed to be bipartisan? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2218.78s)]
*  I think previous democratic administrations would have put that in the bipartisan border [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2225.02s)]
*  bill I think. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2229.28s)]
*  I also have in mind our dreamers. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2230.28s)]
*  She ain't doing none of this shit, Chad. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2232.06s)]
*  She ain't doing none of this. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2235.06s)]
*  If she was doing any of that it would be the bill that she's talking about. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2236.06s)]
*  It's so many of our dreams. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2239.06s)]
*  And I'd be chirping significantly that. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2240.06s)]
*  I'd still be chirping because I'm like, I'd still be upset at the right wing border bill [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2241.82s)]
*  funding mechanisms of the border walling. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2246.2999999999997s)]
*  But they didn't even put that in there. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2248.38s)]
*  They didn't put any of this shit that she's talking about in there. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2249.82s)]
*  There's no clear bill that will ever pass Congress. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2252.2599999999998s)]
*  All things considered, there is no clean bill that will be giving amnesty to immigrants [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2256.58s)]
*  and also protecting dreamers that will ever pass Congress. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2261.8599999999997s)]
*  The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2265.42s)]
*  our agricultural industry. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2272.42s)]
*  And they too have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2275.38s)]
*  come together to fix our broken immigration system. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2281.8599999999997s)]
*  Well as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2287.3s)]
*  solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2296.3s)]
*  For far too long we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2302.02s)]
*  And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2308.7799999999997s)]
*  And the contrast in this election is clear. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2313.96s)]
*  It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2316.64s)]
*  In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2324.2s)]
*  He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2330.44s)]
*  He did not solve the shortage of border agents. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2334.4s)]
*  He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2338.2400000000002s)]
*  He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2343.88s)]
*  in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2350.28s)]
*  As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against Fentanyl. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2356.36s)]
*  This part is true. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2364.88s)]
*  And what did he do instead? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2365.84s)]
*  Well let's talk about that. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2368.04s)]
*  He separated families. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2370.26s)]
*  He ripped toddlers out of their mothers arms, put children in cages and tried to end protections for dreamers. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2372.0s)]
*  He made the challenges at the border worse. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2379.72s)]
*  And he is still, and he is still fanning the flames of fear and division. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2383.0s)]
*  And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW_JwG-lqQ&t=2391.26s)]
