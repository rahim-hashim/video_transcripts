# Discussing Future Streams With March
**HasanAbi:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4)
*  That's another thing that we're gonna be doing in Japan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=0.0s)]
*  They're gonna put you in... [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=2.0s)]
*  Oh god, what's the new one called? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=4.0s)]
*  The new game? I forgot. Death Stranding 2? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=6.0s)]
*  Death Stranding 2, yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=8.0s)]
*  That'd be amazing. If I got mocapped... [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=10.0s)]
*  Mocapped into Death Stranding 2? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=12.0s)]
*  I would let him mocap my feet. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=14.0s)]
*  Easy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=16.0s)]
*  He doesn't mocap men's feet, I don't think. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=18.0s)]
*  Tell me what the chat is saying. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=20.0s)]
*  I will. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=22.0s)]
*  As far as enjoying the show... [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=28.0s)]
*  Hi chat. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=34.0s)]
*  It is kinda wild, like... [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=36.0s)]
*  If I just sat in my house [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=40.0s)]
*  and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=42.0s)]
*  I was like, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=44.0s)]
*  I'm gonna be like, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=46.0s)]
*  I'm gonna sit in my house [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=48.0s)]
*  and talk to you about the news, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=50.0s)]
*  like, which requires [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=52.0s)]
*  so much less uplift. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=54.0s)]
*  And it's like such a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=56.0s)]
*  streamlined process. Chat's like, no, that's great. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=58.0s)]
*  That's exactly what I want. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=60.0s)]
*  I go outside and I try to do like something physical, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=62.0s)]
*  maybe a collaboration. Chat's like, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=64.0s)]
*  nope, not interested. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=66.0s)]
*  You're saying, it was cool, it was cool, I fucked with it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=68.0s)]
*  I fucked with it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=70.0s)]
*  The people who are here like that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=76.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little tough to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=82.0s)]
*  I think keep that super engaging. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=86.0s)]
*  This is somewhat of a devastating prospect [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=92.0s)]
*  for Japan Streams is what I'm worried about. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=94.0s)]
*  I'm not as worried about that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=96.0s)]
*  I wanna make sure that like, chat is conditioned. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=98.0s)]
*  The community is conditioned [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=100.0s)]
*  into [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=102.0s)]
*  enjoying things [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=104.0s)]
*  that aren't immediately [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=106.0s)]
*  like, political commentary. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=108.0s)]
*  Well, I think the thing with Japan [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=110.0s)]
*  is like, it'll be [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=112.0s)]
*  a lot more novel. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=114.0s)]
*  I don't think so, but it is what it is. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=118.0s)]
*  Enjoy harder. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=130.0s)]
*  They're just [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=132.0s)]
*  whipping themselves into shape. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=134.0s)]
*  They're also saying I'm right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=136.0s)]
*  No, this is the same as [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=140.0s)]
*  like the Copium session surrounding [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=142.0s)]
*  gaming [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=144.0s)]
*  where they're like, no, it's just like, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=146.0s)]
*  I'm in Europe and you're playing at a different time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=148.0s)]
*  It's like, no, you're in here [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=150.0s)]
*  so obviously for you it's different. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=152.0s)]
*  But for the people that leave, they leave because [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=154.0s)]
*  it's not politics. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=156.0s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=158.0s)]
*  Maybe I should do less. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=162.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=164.0s)]
*  Maybe I should do less. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=166.0s)]
*  No, I'm saying maybe I should do less streaming. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=168.0s)]
*  Oh, just streaming as a whole? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=172.0s)]
*  I mean, how were the Japan IRL streams [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=178.0s)]
*  last time, numbers wise? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=180.0s)]
*  I feel like they were consistently good. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=182.0s)]
*  No, there was a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=184.0s)]
*  I think there was a period where it was like [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=186.0s)]
*  four or five years ago. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=188.0s)]
*  I think there was a period where it was like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=190.0s)]
*  40k, but that was [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=192.0s)]
*  because I think someone was botting [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=194.0s)]
*  me and like Miskiven Pokeman. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=196.0s)]
*  It was during the kick drama. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=198.0s)]
*  So I think they were like consistently [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=202.0s)]
*  probably like 20k. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=204.0s)]
*  Which was lower [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=208.0s)]
*  than average. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=210.0s)]
*  But then it was like 30-40k [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=212.0s)]
*  because people were like, someone was like [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=214.0s)]
*  botting us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=216.0s)]
*  Literally just like the three people [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=218.0s)]
*  that were outspokenly [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=220.0s)]
*  against kick [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=222.0s)]
*  mysteriously got like [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=224.0s)]
*  a viewership boost. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=228.0s)]
*  Or maybe not, I don't know. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=236.0s)]
*  What are people saying? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=238.0s)]
*  They're all saying Japan IRL will be goaded. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=240.0s)]
*  And I completely agree. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=242.0s)]
*  I think the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=244.0s)]
*  reality is Japan IRL [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=246.0s)]
*  with like a bunch of different content every day [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=248.0s)]
*  a bunch of cool new fun things [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=250.0s)]
*  with everybody being very engaged [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=252.0s)]
*  is gonna [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=254.0s)]
*  just be more interesting and engaging [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=256.0s)]
*  than like a basketball [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=258.0s)]
*  street. I agree. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=260.0s)]
*  That's really all it is. Also, I mean [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=264.0s)]
*  it's also just chat interaction. It's like when we're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=266.0s)]
*  IRLing and like [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=268.0s)]
*  seeing shit, looking at shit, we'll all [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=270.0s)]
*  have chat on our phones. We'll all like [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=272.0s)]
*  be able to like engage. It's like when you're playing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=274.0s)]
*  basketball you literally can't talk and chat [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=276.0s)]
*  for like an hour. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=278.0s)]
*  True. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=280.0s)]
*  Also, like I mean [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=284.0s)]
*  you're alienating a bunch of like [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=286.0s)]
*  fucking online gamers who [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=288.0s)]
*  don't do any physical activity. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=290.0s)]
*  They don't want to go outside. And like [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=292.0s)]
*  expecting them to like sit and watch basketball [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=294.0s)]
*  it's like unsurprisingly [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=296.0s)]
*  they'll be like. Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=298.0s)]
*  Onkball went hard, I think. Yeah, it was cool. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=300.0s)]
*  It was for a good cause obviously and then [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=302.0s)]
*  I think it was fun. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=304.0s)]
*  Onkball went hard as hell. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=308.0s)]
*  Swag is cool. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=312.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's dope. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=314.0s)]
*  Oh, the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=324.0s)]
*  beamer. The initial, the original [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=326.0s)]
*  electric beamer. Which one? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=328.0s)]
*  The Beater, whatever it's called. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=330.0s)]
*  There's one over there. Do you like those? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=332.0s)]
*  I love those. They look [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=334.0s)]
*  so sick. It looks like an actual [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=336.0s)]
*  supercar. Yeah. But you can get one [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=338.0s)]
*  for like 30 grand. Oh, really? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=340.0s)]
*  I think because it's like the first [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=342.0s)]
*  generation electric vehicle. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=344.0s)]
*  It was the first, I think it was the first ever [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=346.0s)]
*  EV that BMW [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=348.0s)]
*  ever made. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=350.0s)]
*  I think my friend had one of those. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=352.0s)]
*  And it looks sick. I mean look at it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=356.0s)]
*  I some [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=358.0s)]
*  Marshal Hassan, it doesn't matter what PaulieNerds [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=360.0s)]
*  wants when he's doing higher roles, you're going to an entire [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=362.0s)]
*  new audience. Yeah, also you're just [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=364.0s)]
*  a lot happier. That's true. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=366.0s)]
*  I do enjoy being outside. That's a big [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=368.0s)]
*  thing I think. I mean you, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=370.0s)]
*  I don't need to tell you this, you're a streamer. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=372.0s)]
*  Chat will play off of your energy [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=374.0s)]
*  and if you're having the best time [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=376.0s)]
*  ever in Japan, people [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=378.0s)]
*  will be. I mean I was having a pretty good time [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=380.0s)]
*  today. My point is. Sure, yeah. But you can't [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=382.0s)]
*  engage with them because you're crazy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=384.0s)]
*  My point is just like, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=386.0s)]
*  you know, it's just [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=388.0s)]
*  I just don't have the audience [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=390.0s)]
*  for it. Like my audience is [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=392.0s)]
*  so conditioned to politics now. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=394.0s)]

*  two different content creators do the exact [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=408.0s)]
*  same content in the exact same way. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=410.0s)]
*  One would have a ginormous audience [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=412.0s)]
*  because they're like, you know, an IRL [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=414.0s)]
*  focused community. One is [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=416.0s)]

*  they're just like a smaller content creator. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=420.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. The audience [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=422.0s)]
*  will stay for one and not for the other. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=424.0s)]

*  politics. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=454.0s)]
*  Which is fine. Also, I mean, that's what you do. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=456.0s)]

*  Like think about it. Even the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=474.0s)]
*  firefighter stream. Like that's a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=476.0s)]

*  on incarcerated firefighters and offer [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=494.0s)]
*  commentary. Then they would [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=496.0s)]
*  where I go directly [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=498.0s)]

*  It's so chill. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=754.0s)]
*  That was such a funny combination. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=756.0s)]
*  I think Kaho and Skara [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=758.0s)]
*  together was fantastic. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=760.0s)]
*  We need to do more weird [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=762.0s)]
*  crossovers like that. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=764.0s)]
*  Those are the best ones. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=766.0s)]
*  How many hours have we streamed? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=768.0s)]
*  Have we streamed today? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=770.0s)]
*  You're at 4 hours and 12 minutes. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=772.0s)]
*  But I guess in the car [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=774.0s)]
*  probably like 2? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=776.0s)]
*  I think we left at like 12. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=780.0s)]
*  Okay so like 3? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=782.0s)]
*  So only 3 hours and we burned through 3 [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=784.0s)]
*  batteries? Yeah. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=786.0s)]
*  That's not good. That's a problem for sure. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=788.0s)]
*  That's really bad bro. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=790.0s)]
*  The old backpack would go for... [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=792.0s)]
*  We have the new juice one. We just put this battery in [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=794.0s)]
*  which will probably give us another like hour and change. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=796.0s)]
*  So I'd say total we have like 4 and a half hours. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=798.0s)]
*  But that's [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=800.0s)]
*  4 and a half hours with 3 batteries. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=804.0s)]
*  4 and a half hours with 3 batteries is not... [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=806.0s)]
*  I guess the idea [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=808.0s)]
*  is that the best solution would be to find a way to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=810.0s)]
*  charge the batteries while they're not being used. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=812.0s)]
*  So if we had some way to like charge [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=814.0s)]
*  this... I don't think we can [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=816.0s)]
*  charge those without... while we were using [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=818.0s)]
*  yeah. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=820.0s)]
*  Or just get a bunch of them. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=822.0s)]
*  I guess. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=824.0s)]
*  That's part of the reason why I wanted to do this today chat [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=826.0s)]
*  was because I wanted to... We're limit testing. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=828.0s)]
*  Yeah I wanted to see what it [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=830.0s)]
*  looks like. Like I wanted to see what the bandwidth [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=832.0s)]
*  looks like if it's like interrupted at all [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=834.0s)]
*  at any point. Just get a little [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=836.0s)]
*  bike for March to Petal and charge the batteries. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=838.0s)]
*  Yeah that's a great idea. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=840.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=842.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=844.0s)]
*  That back breaking labor. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=846.0s)]
*  That is... [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=848.0s)]
*  this job. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=850.0s)]
*  The horse does need to work out [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=852.0s)]
*  more. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=854.0s)]
*  I do work out. I agree chat. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=856.0s)]
*  What is this bumper to bumper traffic man? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=862.0s)]
*  But yeah so Cajon Shibuya. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=868.0s)]
*  Maybe a little [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=870.0s)]
*  Sea Dog action. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=872.0s)]
*  We can do a Sea Dog one. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=874.0s)]
*  Maybe we do a Sea Dog Cajon one. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=876.0s)]
*  We'll go film it in Austin's [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=880.0s)]
*  Fuck Palace. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=882.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=884.0s)]
*  Which they don't know about that yet. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=886.0s)]
*  Oh they'll find out. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=888.0s)]
*  We talked about... yeah we... [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=890.0s)]

*  next Fjärand [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=894.0s)]
*  Fjärand pod. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=896.0s)]
*  Where we talk about our [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=898.0s)]
*  Japanuary [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=900.0s)]
*  experiences. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=902.0s)]
*  Oh Chris Broad. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=906.0s)]
*  Can you get a Broad in Japan on the pod? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=908.0s)]
*  We haven't done anything with him yet. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=910.0s)]
*  PewDiePie. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=912.0s)]
*  I mean that's... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=914.0s)]
*  You're going to piss me off because that's like [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=916.0s)]
*  you need to do that. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=918.0s)]
*  You need to talk to these people. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=920.0s)]
*  Dude first of all [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=922.0s)]
*  Not only am I not close with [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=924.0s)]
*  I don't know PewDiePie at all. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=926.0s)]
*  But also [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=928.0s)]
*  If PewDiePie [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=930.0s)]
*  knows who I am he probably does not have a very positive [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=932.0s)]
*  opinion of me. Because [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=934.0s)]
*  when he was doing his right wing arc [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=936.0s)]
*  I was kind of hammering him a bit. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=938.0s)]
*  And you were wrong for that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=940.0s)]
*  I definitely [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=942.0s)]
*  was not wrong for that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=944.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=946.0s)]
*  Uh. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=948.0s)]
*  Uh. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=950.0s)]
*  But yeah Chris Broad for sure. I mean you can get him. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=952.0s)]

*  Hopefully. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=966.0s)]
*  He's in Japan. Oh Premiere 2? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=968.0s)]
*  I don't know. Um. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=970.0s)]
*  There's also a lot of [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=972.0s)]
*  content creators that are going to be in Japan while we're [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=974.0s)]
*  in Japan. Yeah yeah. So we can do something with them as well. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=976.0s)]
*  I mean that's kind of the whole reason we're doing it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=978.0s)]
*  The roomies are all going to be there. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=980.0s)]
*  Yeah there's a lot of people actually. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=982.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=984.0s)]
*  Well that's another thing is like [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=986.0s)]
*  We technically need to film two episodes. However [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=988.0s)]
*  it's like if we have everybody there [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=990.0s)]
*  and it's all in Japan it makes it a little [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=992.0s)]
*  more special. We might as well bank a couple. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=994.0s)]
*  That way you know maybe [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=996.0s)]
*  bank a couple so I can I don't know [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=998.0s)]
*  take a weekend off. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1000.0s)]
*  What a concept I know. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1002.0s)]
*  It's literally March trying to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1004.0s)]
*  do like four episodes. I'm Austin-ing [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1006.0s)]
*  right now. So we can [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1008.0s)]
*  fucking stay in Japan [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1010.0s)]
*  for like eight weeks after we leave. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1012.0s)]
*  Like 100%. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1016.0s)]
*  I'm like no it's for [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1018.0s)]
*  the show. Not even like [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1020.0s)]
*  remotely subtle about it at all. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1022.0s)]

*  And asks if there's still a cop [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1078.0s)]
*  at certain locations. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1080.0s)]

*  if there's like a highway. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1092.0s)]
*  Accident. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1094.0s)]

*  They were living the high life. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1674.0s)]
*  And I think right now [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1678.0s)]
*  China is going through that phase. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1680.0s)]
*  What do you think about Xiao Hongxu? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1688.0s)]
*  Xiao Hongxu? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1690.0s)]
*  Radicalizing all these Americans [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1692.0s)]

*  chill life is in China. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1696.0s)]

*  falling off of factories [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1700.0s)]
*  into nets as they like [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1702.0s)]
*  and can afford groceries. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1704.0s)]
*  Get paid three cents an hour [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1706.0s)]
*  to put together [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1708.0s)]

*  I'm happy that like [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1716.0s)]
*  on the one hand I'm happy that people are [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1718.0s)]
*  recognizing that these are just like normal human beings. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1720.0s)]
*  There's a variety of different like [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1722.0s)]
*  you know there's a middle class there as well. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1724.0s)]
*  And that [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1726.0s)]
*  China isn't this like hellish dystopia [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1728.0s)]
*  that the mainstream media presents it as. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1730.0s)]
*  But I think a lot of those people that are going on [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1732.0s)]
*  going to Xiao Hongxu aren't like [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1734.0s)]
*  like you're [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1736.0s)]
*  like people's aunts aren't going to go on [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1738.0s)]
*  Xiao Hongxu in the way that they went on TikTok. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1740.0s)]
*  Maybe down the line if they ban TikTok. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1742.0s)]
*  And the Xiao Hongxu application is like more [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1746.0s)]
*  western-famous. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1748.0s)]
*  And I think [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1750.0s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1752.0s)]
*  I think they've changed the layout [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1754.0s)]
*  to be more [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1756.0s)]
*  hospitable to westerners. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1758.0s)]
*  But [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1760.0s)]
*  having said that [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1764.0s)]
*  I mean I think it's like [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1766.0s)]
*  there's also a dual threat there too [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1768.0s)]
*  because like I don't think the Chinese government [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1770.0s)]
*  cares right now as far as like having [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1772.0s)]
*  Xiao Hongxu readily available to Americans. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1774.0s)]
*  But I suspect that they probably don't [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1776.0s)]
*  care about it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1778.0s)]
*  I think that [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1780.0s)]
*  but I suspect that they probably don't want [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1782.0s)]
*  a bunch of Americans constantly [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1784.0s)]
*  communicating with Chinese people [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1786.0s)]
*  and open up an opportunity [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1788.0s)]
*  for [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1790.0s)]
*  PsyOps and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1792.0s)]
*  you know [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1794.0s)]
*  espionage opportunities, PsyOps [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1796.0s)]
*  opportunities, things of that nature. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1798.0s)]
*  So what do they do? They ban Red Note? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1800.0s)]
*  I can see them taking it off the marketplace [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1802.0s)]
*  yeah. Also like isn't [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1804.0s)]
*  the fucking the toothpaste out of [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1806.0s)]
*  the tube already? It's like won't that be even like a [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1808.0s)]
*  worse look if they're like no stop looking at all these [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1810.0s)]
*  normal people on [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1812.0s)]
*  this Chinese app or banning them too. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1814.0s)]
*  No I'm saying like instead of the American government [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1816.0s)]
*  banning it I'm saying the Chinese government could [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1818.0s)]
*  take the initiatives [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1820.0s)]
*  in that situation as well [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1822.0s)]

*  something about it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1826.0s)]
*  And part of that is because [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1832.0s)]
*  like immediately [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1834.0s)]
*  people went there. There's like [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1836.0s)]
*  you know some cultural exchange happening. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1838.0s)]
*  People are lying about it being like [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1840.0s)]
*  anti-LGBT which I think is really funny because it's like [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1842.0s)]
*  apparently the gayest app [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1844.0s)]
*  out of all the Chinese apps. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKMeJvIzBz4&t=1846.0s)]
