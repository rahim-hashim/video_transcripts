Wait, let me, let me restart my discord. Let me update and restarted. He's a musician. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=47.239999999999995s)]

*  and then turn it back on? Yeah. Give me one sec. Oh, there it is. Mary socialist miss. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  Hello. Oh, thank you. We're, we're doing our very best out here to try to abide by the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  principles of socialism, which is, you know, rich, bad rich guy. Give a poor guy gift. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=112.8s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I heard about that. Yeah. In the communist manifesto. Yeah. You got better [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=119.72s)]
*  swag than Alex too. What the fuck? Yeah. What are you? Can he see us or no? I think he can. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=124.88s)]
*  Oh sick. All right. You're on stream, Jesse. You're all. Yeah. Everyone can see you now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=131.12s)]
*  So there's only like 25,000 people in here. A lot of people. Yeah. Um, it's all right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, it's a little, it's looking a little light today, but it's all good. It's Christmas, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  you know, but Jesse, thank you so much for coming on. Alex said that as someone who's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=148.48s)]
*  going to rabbinical school, you're going to teach me some important things about Hanukkah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=153.56s)]
*  I must warn you. Yes. I was almost by semi to the year of I stopped. Yeah. Well, just [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=159.92s)]
*  FYR. No, sorry. Close, close to it. Close. I lost the Candace Owens who is actually anti-Semitic. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  So at least there's that, but it was, it was me. We were the runner ups. It was me, Greta [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=172.04s)]
*  Thurnberg and Candace Owens and Candace Owens, one anti-Semite of the year. Me and Greta lost. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=176.56s)]
*  Who's responsible for this list? Stop anti-Semitism.org, which is one neurotic Long Island lady who [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=183.44s)]
*  it's, it's down here, who, who acts like she is like a serious institution, but it's actually [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=191.24s)]
*  just like an insane Hasbro operation conducted by one, like actually insane lady. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=198.4s)]
*  I'm happy to, to hopefully lend, you know, some legitimacy to perceived, you know, anti-Semite [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=206.72s)]
*  in the face of upside down. Okay. Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. Okay. Yes. Thank [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=213.36s)]
*  you. I, I, well, I brought you on as someone who's going to rabbinical school because I [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  wanted to learn more about Judaism so I can be anti-Semitic better. Of course, of course [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=228.72s)]
*  I'll be better at my anti-Semitism. So what is this? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=234.36s)]
*  So great. We got to have an order right here or a Hanukki depending on your, your preferred [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=238.52s)]
*  language, which we like customarily during Hanukkah. It's symbolic of famously an armed [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=242.88s)]
*  revolt against an empire. So it feels sort of in line with a socialists, if you will. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=257.2s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  So the story goes, second century BCE taking place in Palestine at the time, Hellenistic [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=265.52s)]
*  Judea. So it's been conquered by Alexander and there's sort of a couple of other smaller [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  dynasties that are sort of in and out. And the people start kind of moving from [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=283.36s)]
*  Judaic practice and you get these sort of two larger camps, which are sort of traditional [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=289.84s)]
*  Judahites, pre-Jewish and people who are sort of becoming Hellenistic. And the Seleucid dynasty, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  which is the sort of larger power at the time comes in and in the face of the sort of conflict [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  that's brewing internally, they sort of start violently suppressing traditional religious worship. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=307.28s)]
*  And so you get this sort of armed revolt by a group called the Maccabees, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=316.0s)]
*  and they're largely outnumbered. They're sort of centered ultimately in Jerusalem. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=321.28s)]
*  They're able to sort of fight back to take much of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is pretty much leveled. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=327.68s)]
*  They're able to sort of salvage the temple, which at that time is a very big deal. And [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=332.0s)]
*  there's a menorah in the temple. It had always been there. And the story goes that it sort of stays [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=337.44s)]
*  lit and it's supposed to stay aflame all the time. The story goes that it stays lit for eight days. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=343.76s)]
*  And so that's why we celebrate Hanukkah for eight days. And so the story could end there, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=349.2s)]
*  but if you sort of allow history to continue to unfold, you realize that about 30 years later, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=354.64s)]
*  also in the second century BCE, that the Maccabees, who had sort of fought for their [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=360.88s)]
*  independence, turned their desires to conquest and start violently pursuing a lot of the sort [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=367.12s)]
*  of people outside of Jerusalem and turning to their own people, become exceptionally violent against [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=376.48s)]
*  people who aren't practicing in the same way that they are. So for me, I think it's a holiday that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=381.6s)]
*  feels crazy topical as we think about how people who have historically faced persecution and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  oppression can oppress and how oppression can be a way to get back to the people who [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=390.8s)]
*  as an example have suffered side can also perpetrate side as we're watching. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=398.0s)]
*  I have no idea who you're talking about. I don't know. I'm talking about [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  totally, totally, totally for sure. So we can keep the leg in the spirit of socialists, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  but to say that I think you don't have to look that far in the story to sort of look for a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  complicated legacy in power and violence and to think about how easy it is to sort of occupy [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=420.24s)]
*  both sides of that sword. So what do you like about Hanukkah, Jesse? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=429.04s)]
*  Well, it's an interesting question. I think it doesn't really matter in the sort of Jewish [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  canon. I think it's sort of been built up in the American psyche because Christmas is a big deal [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=438.32s)]
*  and we wanted something. So that's what Hanukkah has become. It's sort of like a little bit of foil [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  to Christmas. I would say in the last couple of years, as I've kind of dug a little bit more into [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=452.32s)]
*  my own Jewish journey, I'm a little bit less interested in Hanukkah, but what do I like about [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=456.24s)]
*  it? I like the food. I like latkes. I like being a pastry. Hanukkah is like elementary. Hanukkah is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=462.08s)]
*  ass. Yeah. He said Hanukkah is just like for fair weather fans. Like real ones are doing, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=466.8s)]
*  what is it called? Sukkot? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Real ones out there. They have a tent in the backyard. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=473.2s)]
*  Where's your tent in the backyard? I don't have one. Yeah. Did you go in and get a citrus? I don't [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=480.4s)]
*  do any of that. That's what I'm saying. We got to bring you back in the religion, man. You got the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=485.36s)]
*  tent. You got the citrus. You're on top of it. You know, you're. Yeah. He's a casual. So how do we [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  like this bad boy? How does this work? Yeah. Do we just wait? You don't even know for real? No, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=496.56s)]
*  oh, OK. He's the guy. I don't know. The guy. Are you setting me up? It's very generous. Very, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=502.56s)]
*  very generous. So you got two different opinions about this. OK. Oh, well. Jews love dialectics. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=508.4s)]
*  There's these two guys, Shumai and Halal. They have two different opinions about how you like [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=516.56s)]
*  them in order. One says you start with eight, you go down. The other one says you start with one, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=519.76s)]
*  you build up. So most common people start with one. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=524.96s)]
*  Well, you got this one there. Yeah. So this one's the helper. Oh, guy right here. So this is the one [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=530.88s)]
*  that we use to light the other ones. Oh, OK. This one doesn't count in terms of the nights. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=537.9200000000001s)]
*  OK, got it. If you wanted. Yeah, it's a freebie. It's a bonus game. Alex, you got the jankiest [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=543.76s)]
*  man. Look at this. It's like the airport. It's literally shaking like it's not even this is a [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=552.48s)]
*  fire hazard. Now it's Joe. It's Joe. This is crazy. Joe, it's Joe. I can't. So so what we would do is [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=557.44s)]
*  we're going to light these bad boys. We're going to light these bad boys. Hopefully it doesn't [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=564.96s)]
*  catch my house on fire. It'll be fine. That's crazy. I do. You're fine. OK. Wait, hold on. Let [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=568.0s)]
*  me go. Is there a specific is there a specific way to light it on fire? He's going to tell us. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=574.56s)]
*  So so I mean, if you're looking at it, I would suggest. First candles to your right. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  Like, yeah, like this. Well, you might be reversed on on that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=590.64s)]
*  I don't know how reverse. So first candle is to my right. Like this is the first candle, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=597.52s)]
*  That's that's great. OK, that's to my left. I want to move it. Hold on. So now it's to my right. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=601.68s)]
*  Right. Yeah, perfect. So I would also protect if you want to give a lighter, you can just [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=606.96s)]
*  base of them and stick them in. OK, that's what they teach in rabbinical school. That's the. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=615.84s)]
*  OK, hold on. I'm going to go grab a match real quick. Can I light it with a match? There's no [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=622.88s)]
*  issue with that, right? No, actually matches is probably more more technically correct than a lighter. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=626.32s)]
*  Hey, what's up, dude? You look very festive. Thank you. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=632.32s)]
*  How are you doing? How are you feeling? Yeah, I'm very sick. Yeah, I'm sorry. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=639.04s)]
*  No, it's OK. It's nice. I mean, I'm glad I get to celebrate in some capacity because I got out of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  bed for this and I'm going right back to bed afterwards. Yeah, this is your big performance. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=650.24s)]
*  Big performance, baby. It's too bad you didn't set up your Spotify. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=655.04s)]
*  It's too bad you didn't set up your Spotify so you could plug your Spotify. It doesn't exist. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=660.4s)]
*  I know you're not going to get any dulcetones tonight. This is going to be the nasal sounds of [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=664.24s)]
*  a future rabbi. What did you get into L.A.? Like noon today. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=670.0s)]
*  What time do you leave? Six a.m. Oh, man. Yeah, it's been a long day. Whoa. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=677.84s)]
*  Do you have to see Nosferatu yet? No, I'm going to see it tonight, but I can't make him leave [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=685.6s)]
*  the house. He doesn't leave the house. So I have to go see it. What are you going to do? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=689.52s)]
*  I'm going to go see it. I'm going to see it with somebody. I'm dying to see that movie. It's going [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=692.64s)]
*  to be sick. What is it? Is it scary? Yeah, spooky, but it's sexy. I brought you baklava as well. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabHchdVzrM&t=696.16s)]
