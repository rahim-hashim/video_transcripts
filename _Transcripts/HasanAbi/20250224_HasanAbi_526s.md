# Visiting QTCinderella In Utah | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M)
*  It's a very weird episode in terms of like our background, obviously, but that's what I did. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=0.0s)]
*  We went to visit Cutie Cinderella. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=4.4s)]
*  She seems a lot happier, which is annoying because I don't want her to be happy in Salt Lake City. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  I pulled to Austin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=19.6s)]
*  I actually flew to where's Kaia? Kaia is in the backyard running around. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to explain to you why in a second. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=26.2s)]
*  I'm just letting her free roam today because damn y'all are annoying. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=28.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=33.1s)]
*  It's been one day since I was not live. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=34.3s)]
*  It's been one day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=37.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=38.2s)]
*  I didn't go live for one day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=38.7s)]
*  Can you guys just let me go through it? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=39.8s)]
*  Anyway, so I flew into Salt Lake City, Utah where this is the last leg of the Cutie Cinderella. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=41.7s)]
*  You know, I'm visiting my family and extended family show and she's been gone for months at this point. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  It feels like it feels like she's been gone for years. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=56.3s)]
*  Point is she's been gone for too long and we had to we had to do an episode with her. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=60.4s)]
*  Obviously, it's been far too long. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=65.8s)]
*  Everybody kept complaining. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=67.8s)]
*  Everyone was like running under an episode with Cutie. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=68.89999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, listen, she's the one who's running away from us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=71.1s)]
*  Okay, it is not my fault. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=74.8s)]
*  But yeah, we did. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=78.1s)]
*  We went to we went to Utah and this is... [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=79.0s)]
*  We'll eat you for lunch. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=82.8s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=84.1s)]
*  I think I think I think you should settle this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=84.6s)]
*  I think you need a boxer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=86.5s)]
*  And then oh no, everything is on the wide. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  Oh, that sucks. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  Marsh didn't have enough time to actually put it together. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=93.5s)]
*  I went and I lugged three different cameras there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  We had switchers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=99.3s)]
*  We had a whole system. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=101.1s)]
*  But anyway, well you can watch and listen to it later. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=103.3s)]
*  It's a really good. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  It's a really good app. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  It's a very weird episode in terms of like our background obviously, but that's what I did. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  We went to visit Cutie Cinderella. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=113.5s)]
*  She seems a lot happier, which is annoying because I don't want her to be happy in Salt Lake City. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=115.2s)]
*  I want her to be happy in Los Angeles. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=123.8s)]
*  But the outfit was fire. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=128.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=129.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=130.2s)]
*  After Cutie read out the fear and group text, you should be shot out of a cannon. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=131.8s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=135.0s)]
*  Why I don't want her to be happy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=135.4s)]
*  No, she makes better content. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=137.2s)]
*  She makes better content when she's not happy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=140.5s)]
*  But in any case, you had that shit on on Utah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=144.2s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to I wanted to show up for the fans. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=149.6s)]

*  like randomly frequenting around this this ridiculous Park, but also I'll tell you I'll tell you this part of the story. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=162.3s)]
*  I I get on the plane one of the worst experiences of all time whatever and I'm praying to like, you know, multiple different [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=171.5s)]
*  gods, obviously like DEI gods, you know what I mean? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=180.0s)]
*  I'm like, I hope there's like a homosexual pilot like like I was trying to see if the pilot was interested in like zodiac [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=183.70000000000002s)]

*  Because I couldn't like I couldn't you know, I if I stare into the cockpit and the pilots are white men. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=195.9s)]
*  I'm cooked. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=201.3s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=202.3s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, there's no DEI happening right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=202.9s)]
*  Like there are there are no DEI's happening in on this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  Like is this safe for travel? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  Like who assigned who signed off on this lack of DEI, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  So anyway, we luckily make it right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=217.9s)]

*  I get out of the I get out of the car. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=227.8s)]
*  Austin greets me outside of his huddle and he was like he was like, oh has anyone stopped you so far? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=229.7s)]
*  I was like, nah, I'm washed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  He's like, oh, I guess you're washed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=239.2s)]
*  So I was like, I'm really hungry. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's go get some food walk down the street. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=244.7s)]
*  We go and get some food. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=246.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=247.89999999999998s)]
*  And instantly the dude one of you guys was working the counter at this place. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  So obviously not a Mormon or maybe a former Mormon because it's Sunday. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=254.6s)]
*  And then the person also eating at the restaurant freaked out as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=259.7s)]
*  And they both got stoked. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  So everywhere I went there was a couple there was a couple of you hasanabe heads out there for sure. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=267.5s)]
*  The mountains are so pretty. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=273.3s)]
*  I will say this about Utah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=275.0s)]
*  The mountains are crazy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=276.4s)]
*  They go crazy, dude. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=277.4s)]
*  I get why I get why they have this whole like mountain crunchy granola aesthetic for everything [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=279.4s)]
*  because that's the only thing that's popping in Utah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=288.5s)]
*  Okay, that and like a bunch of corked up shouties who are Mormon and you know, live in life that way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  But oh my lord, dude. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=298.5s)]
*  It is the mountains are crazy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=301.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm glad there was no inversion for you King. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=304.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, they tried. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=306.1s)]
*  They didn't even try to convert me, bro. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's be real. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=309.1s)]
*  You know, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=311.1s)]
*  it's on are you even able to say you care about the lives and deaths of Israeli civilians? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=312.70000000000005s)]
*  Yes, super simple. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  I've interviewed plenty of Israeli people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=318.7s)]
*  There's a lot of Israeli leftists in my community as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=321.0s)]
*  And yes, I care about the the lives and deaths of all civilians Israeli Palestinian doesn't matter. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=324.2s)]
*  Are you also going to Gaza or did you just say that to prove bullshit points was the second question. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=331.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm working with some people to potentially do it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=336.0s)]
*  But virtually every single person I've talked to you know, you don't have to ban that guy virtually every single person. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=339.2s)]
*  I've talked to has stated that while they can have guarantees for security inside of the ship, there's no guarantees from Israel. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=344.2s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=351.3s)]
*  But yeah, so there is that there is that problem. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=353.4s)]
*  Also, we don't even know if the ceasefire is going to actually hold. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=358.2s)]
*  So there's that issue as well following since 12 minutes ago unfollowed came back just to follow just to say that I unbanned you just for the record. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  That wasn't your tune while you left the children with families dying as hostages. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  I didn't do that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=373.3s)]
*  But I think that you probably saw something completely out of context and are reacting to that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=375.1s)]
*  But it's okay. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=381.8s)]
*  I don't think you actually care about anything that I have to say regardless. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=382.6s)]
*  But hey, if you wanted the context, I gave it to you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=386.8s)]
*  Your stalkers will ring up every contact to get you targeted. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=390.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=394.0s)]
*  Anyway, 60 minutes in let the man speaking to that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  So it was great. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=398.6s)]
*  Utah was fantastic. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=401.8s)]
*  I mean, it was a little boring. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=403.0s)]
*  But hey, by the way, la raza shout out to la raza. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=404.0s)]
*  I asked every single person what was going on here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=407.7s)]
*  First time in Utah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=411.4s)]
*  I never been there. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=412.2s)]
*  I asked every single person what was going on with the with the Mexican flags and everybody was like, I don't know. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=413.4s)]
*  They just kind of they just kind of ride hard, which I thought was interesting. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=419.9s)]
*  I like no one knew what this was about. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=423.7s)]
*  Should I went skiing brother? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=426.5s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMkHy5o32M&t=427.4s)]
