# Iranian attack on US base in Qatar  | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw)
*  Just like Israel gets to be as as it wants to because it has America backing it with its endless air defenses [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=0.0s)]
*  America gets to be as as it wants to all around the world because it has the most powerful military on the war in the world [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=8.36s)]
*  800 military bases can be anywhere around the world and strike with with [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=16.06s)]
*  Severity if it wants to like it did with Iran [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, let's get back to this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=30.0s)]
*  Revolutionary Guards Corps has released a statement following the attacks in Doha [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=32.12s)]
*  It says it launched a powerful and devastating [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=38.4s)]
*  Missile attack on the al-ud-day airbase in Qatar now this base serves as the command center of the US Air Force [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=42.0s)]
*  And is the largest strategic asset of the American? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=49.68s)]
*  army in West Asia [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=53.68s)]
*  Asia [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=55.68s)]
*  Well Katar's Ministry of Defense has released a statement following the Iranian strike on at US base [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=58.28s)]
*  Katar is saying that its air defenses intercepted a salvo of missiles targeting the al-ud-day airbase [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  It continued saying the incident did not result in any deaths nor in any injuries [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=70.0s)]
*  The ministry says Katar's airspace and territory are safe [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=75.28s)]
*  Well joining us now from northern Doha is our correspondent Dorsa Jabari [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  Dorsa you are also out on the streets of Doha tell us what the situation is there [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  Some hour now after we heard those explosions [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=90.38000000000001s)]
*  Well Laura things are returning back to normal [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=97.26s)]
*  It was quite a shock for the local population here when they heard those sounds of explosions over the Doha skies [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  Suddenly just around [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=107.22s)]
*  1645 GMT [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=109.62s)]
*  Many people were initially shocked and scared and quite panicked [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=112.14s)]
*  But then once they realized what had happened [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=116.18s)]
*  Things quiet down [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=118.66s)]
*  Very rapidly and now it appears for now the situation is very calm [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=120.9s)]
*  Most people are going about their daily routine [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=126.18s)]
*  This is of course a very much a surprise to the local population [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=128.98s)]
*  Not something many people here were expecting but there were signs from hours leading up to this attack first the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=133.86s)]
*  Warnings issued by the US embassy here in Katar as well as the British embassy urging their nationals to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=141.78s)]
*  stay indoors basically as well as then the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=147.78s)]
*  Qatar International Airport the Hamid International Airport [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  Announcing the closure of its airspace temporarily and then [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=155.78000000000003s)]
*  It was pretty much evidence that there was an attack looming what we have also heard from the Qatari Foreign Ministry [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=160.82s)]
*  spokesperson Majed Al Ansari is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=167.54s)]
*  That the Qataris have been and they say this is an attack on their sovereignty and they it is when they're with their within [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=169.94s)]
*  Their right to respond accordingly and they also called for an urgency to de-escalate the situation [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=176.34s)]
*  They urged the parties involved specifically Israel to respond to the situation [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=182.5s)]
*  Specifically Israel to refrain from continuing their attacks and escalating the tension that is going to clearly [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=188.34s)]
*  Most likely drag the regional countries into this conflict if it doesn't get resolved very soon [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=197.3s)]
*  The interesting thing we have to note is that this airbase has been here since 1996 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=203.62s)]
*  It has a very long history in Qatar [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=209.22s)]
*  It was at that time when the Qataris spent a billion dollars building it and it is home to around [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=211.62s)]
*  Over 10 000 us personnel at the last figure that we have so it is the biggest one of the biggest airspace [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=218.34s)]
*  fields [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=226.02s)]
*  And military bases belonging to the u.s [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  But it is not the only one there are over 40 000 us troops in the middle east there are 19 bases across this region so [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=229.94s)]
*  Really most of them have been put on high alert [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=239.3s)]
*  So [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=242.42s)]
*  Carried out those attacks on the iranian nuclear facilities that towns for dohan esfahan early sunday morning [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=246.74s)]
*  Now dorsa i'm just going to inform our viewers that in the top corner of our screens now we're seeing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=254.66s)]
*  Debris that has fallen [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=260.82s)]
*  More minor f's I know I see it from one of those [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=266.26s)]
*  Interceptions and we're not quite sure whereabouts in qatar that is we'll try and get a location for you [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=269.3s)]
*  But well for our viewers, but we have talked a lot haven't we about the stars being fired over [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  Israel people having to go to shelters not necessarily [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=283.2s)]
*  Only because of the impact they might have if they're not intercepted but from falling shrapnel and here we are seeing exactly that in qatar [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=287.46s)]

*  Yes, I think initially people did not know what to do and then there were guidances provided [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=392.92s)]
*  The first thing people were told was to take shelter in the metro stations here or underground parking facilities [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=398.36s)]
*  Which there is no shortage of so people did get instructions and there has that has been the guidance from [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=404.76s)]
*  The local government is to ensure people receive the information that they need when they need it [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  But of course these were very traumatic scenes for the majority of people at qatar is home to about two and a half [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=416.68s)]
*  million people and in doha about [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  700,000 people call it home. So it is a significant number and this seriously [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=426.9s)]
*  Uh [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=432.94s)]
*  Disrupted the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=435.58s)]
*  Quiet that has been part of the daily life of most people in this country [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=437.66s)]
*  But many here are now hoping that this was it that there is no continuation of these launch towards [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  al-uday airbase here in qatar though. I just [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=448.94s)]
*  Uh, also, sorry [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=452.7s)]
*  I just wanted to give an idea from you as to what you felt when those explosions happened about an hour ago [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=453.74s)]
*  Because we certainly felt them here in the newsroom. There was a successive wave of explosions [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=459.98s)]
*  You could feel the shaking on the ground here in the studio. Hey, i'm a jason viewer. Just wondering how long until i die [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=465.74s)]
*  Okay, nothing is gonna I mean I can't guarantee it with an absolute certainty but [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=472.7s)]
*  things [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=478.38s)]
*  Do not happen to america. Okay and to americans [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=479.5s)]
*  They don't happen all that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=483.9s)]
*  Uh, they don't happen all that frequently just like israel gets to be as fun as it wants to because it has america backing it with its endless [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=485.42s)]
*  uh air defenses [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=493.18s)]
*  America gets to be as fun as it wants to all around the world because it has the most powerful military on the world in the world [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=495.5s)]
*  800 military bases can be anywhere around the world and strike, uh with with uh [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=503.26s)]
*  Severity if it wants to like it did with iran [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=509.82s)]
*  Okay, but most importantly america's proximity to the instability that it causes over there [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=513.1s)]
*  Shelters the american public from experiencing repercussions [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=520.5400000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's why you got pearl harbor you got [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=524.3000000000001s)]
*  9-eleven those are like the two instances of blowback where there was like immediate retaliation [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=528.38s)]

*  because there is a there is a [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=543.02s)]
*  Opportunity cost to all of this [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=545.72s)]
*  Every single dollar that's being spent waging over there is a dollar that could be spent on u.s soil to improve your life [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=547.82s)]
*  To improve your living conditions to make life a little bit more, uh [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=556.62s)]
*  Livable so when americans actually experience, uh the impact of all this bloodshed all this [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=561.1600000000001s)]
*  Uh, they see it over the course of multiple years. They see it over the course of decades [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=568.3000000000001s)]
*  right [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=573.1800000000001s)]
*  As far as like an immediate impact that you could have potentially experienced here [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=574.22s)]
*  If iran were to stop the straight of hormones [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=579.26s)]
*  Uh from from doing any sort of oil traffic [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=583.1800000000001s)]
*  20 of the the world's uh [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=587.58s)]
*  Oil passes through this uh this important choke point. Okay, if [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=590.38s)]
*  if iran were to actually, uh [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=596.2199999999999s)]
*  Mine the straight of hormones and stop oil from oil vessels from like passing through then you would experience [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=599.26s)]
*  Then you would definitely experience some impact prices would go up [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=605.8199999999999s)]
*  Gas would go up even though a a very tiny amount of gas [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=610.4599999999999s)]
*  That or oil that passes through the straight of hormones is oil that we end up [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=615.74s)]
*  getting [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=621.9s)]
*  Here in the united states of america, it would just like drive up the prices across the board because opec plus is a monopoly [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=623.26s)]
*  It's a cartel. They they set the they set the prices across the board and american oil and gas companies [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=629.18s)]
*  do not uh [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=637.18s)]
*  Do not actually increase its production or redirect some of its oil and gas back to the americans [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=639.66s)]
*  Back to the american market in an effort to stabilize american prices [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=645.8199999999999s)]
*  Because they take advantage of that oil [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=649.74s)]
*  Uh, they take advantage of the higher prices in general. They have not done so during covid [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=652.22s)]
*  They didn't do uh, they did not play ball all regards to how much [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=656.62s)]
*  uh [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=660.7s)]
*  Joe biden tried to force them to do so but they didn't do it [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  Because they also take advantage of the increased prices. It's beneficial for them. So that's one impact that you would see [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=666.62s)]
*  When people say we can pump a lot more oil if gas prices go up [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=672.78s)]
*  that's copium that is operating under the assumption that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=676.38s)]
*  The the oil and gas giants will actually [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=680.62s)]
*  compete [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=684.94s)]
*  With opec plus instead of take advantage of the increased prices. They have never done so so I doubt that they would do it now [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=686.46s)]
*  Did you where were you and what was your experience? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=693.1s)]
*  Well, I was at one of the local malls getting a coffee and I was waiting for a taxi [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=699.98s)]
*  One and then I heard so I was outside and I heard the sounds first and then I felt [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  uh the ground shake [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=709.9s)]
*  Under me and I knew that the attack had happened and it had started and I heard at least four [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=712.6999999999999s)]
*  explosions in the skies [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=718.78s)]
*  And then it was very difficult for people to understand what was happening people around me were asking me where what's going on? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=721.02s)]
*  What should we do? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=727.26s)]
*  And given that we have had some experience in this kind of situation in the past [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=728.54s)]
*  Um, I was a bit more calm than most people but I urged them to basically stay indoors not to be outside in open spaces [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=733.02s)]
*  um, but really it was it didn't last very long and then we got we started getting news and information [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=740.22s)]
*  From official sources here about what people should do and what had just happened [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=747.9s)]
*  The main question now is whether or not this is the end and most likely many [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=752.38s)]
*  Analysts believe that this is what iran intended to do and it was more of a show of force [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=756.62s)]
*  Not only to the americans that are based in the region and the officials in the white house and u.s [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=762.62s)]
*  President donald trump but also to the regional countries that are now in the firing line, of course [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=767.42s)]
*  And you know the iranians the last thing they want to do is to drag a country like qatar into this conflict [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=772.94s)]
*  But it is certainly a reminder that these u.s bases in the region [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=778.78s)]
*  Are now legitimate targets for iran and what it says is its sovereign right to defend itself against [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=783.34s)]
*  The israeli and american aggression on its own soil [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=790.46s)]
*  And this may well be the end of the attack. We we don't know that yet [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=794.14s)]
*  We do know that bahrain has closed its airspace and syria has [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=797.66s)]
*  Its main airbase there in syria is on high alert as our air bases in iraq [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=802.38s)]
*  We don't know what the next step is going to be what we do know though [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=807.18s)]
*  Is that the sense of security that qatar enjoyed it's 2.5 million people the 700 [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=811.9s)]
*  Thousand people in doha many of them expats from around the world the sense of security that they [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=818.3000000000001s)]
*  I was watching the interceptor from my window and cutter. I support iran, but it was scary as hell [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=824.46s)]
*  I can only think about the palestinian people and what they have been through for years. Yeah, it's um, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=828.3000000000001s)]
*  We'll see [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=833.1800000000001s)]
*  This seems this seems like um, this seems like it might be a big [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=834.54s)]
*  Big boon for the trump is a peace through strength president [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=839.74s)]
*  Okay iran's lack of of uh escalation like iran's lack of of presenting a significant deterrence [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=844.62s)]
*  At least for this [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=853.4200000000001s)]
*  At least for for this back and forth with america and iran [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=855.58s)]
*  Feels as though [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=861.1800000000001s)]
*  Maybe trump will pack this up. I don't know if he does this he will get a tremendous boost from this [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=862.86s)]
*  Okay, he'll say you see we showed our military strength [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=869.3399999999999s)]
*  Uh, we got a big w here. We violated iran's [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=874.06s)]
*  Numerous red lines. We violated iran's sovereignty and they didn't want the smoke and they couldn't do anything to us [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=877.98s)]
*  and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=885.42s)]
*  Now we have to stop is like we're going to tell israel to back down and israel will actually back down [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=886.54s)]
*  Well, if they will we'll see if if if there is a real ambition here [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=892.14s)]
*  If there is a real ambition here if this isn't just about destabilization [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=897.26s)]
*  If this isn't about destabilization if this is not about destabilization, this is where it'll end [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=902.14s)]
*  okay [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=908.62s)]
*  but [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=910.2199999999999s)]
*  Trump has so far used the negotiations process to basically [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=911.5799999999999s)]
*  Do whatever the they want they've used the negotiations process to continue [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=918.2199999999999s)]
*  doing more [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=924.06s)]
*  War [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=926.06s)]
*  Working towards [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=929.7399999999999s)]
*  Working, uh a a destabilization effort to be honest. I'm shocked the market didn't crash today [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=932.38s)]
*  I don't think wall street thinks iran is going to seriously retaliate. They're probably right to be honest [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=937.02s)]
*  I mean [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=941.5799999999999s)]
*  Iran signaled that their retaliation was going to be very limited [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=942.6199999999999s)]
*  A white house official told me that trump's goal now is to end and he's going to make it clear to israeli prime minister benjamin [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=946.9399999999999s)]
*  And yahoo we want a deal and don't want any more the official said [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=951.7399999999999s)]
*  Here is massad's very own barak ravid trump calls for ending [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=956.06s)]
*  Uh the after iran's retaliatory attack [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=959.9s)]
*  His story for axios israeli agent barak ravid reporting for axios [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=963.0999999999999s)]
*  How can we be sure he actually wants to end the conflict we have no we have no assurances man [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=975.5s)]
*  Trump's word means nothing [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=981.5s)]
*  America's word means nothing israel's word means something it means the exact opposite, okay [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=983.66s)]
*  America's word usually means the exact opposite as well. So we shall see [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=991.1s)]
*  We shall see [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=995.9s)]
*  from this point on [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=997.5s)]
*  from this point on [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=999.5s)]
*  if israel has uh [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1002.46s)]
*  More destabilization in mind for iran they will continue escalating the conflict which will of course provoke even [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1005.82s)]
*  more ballistic being lobbed in the direction of tel aviv [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1013.34s)]
*  And that is unsustainable for israel without I don't know america entering the conflict and redirecting [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1017.1s)]
*  uh the the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1024.14s)]
*  iranian [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1026.28s)]
*  military response [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1027.74s)]
*  at american targets instead [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1029.5s)]
*  Because if they're too busy defending themselves against like, uh american bombing campaigns [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1032.22s)]
*  That will be overwhelming they they won't be able to continue, uh successfully lobbing ballistic in the direction of israel [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1037.5s)]
*  So israel is the uh most significant player in this once again. This isn't true [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1044.9399999999998s)]
*  It's israel that wants to ceasefire most of all iran would be foolish to accept while they have the upper hand. This isn't true [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1050.6999999999998s)]
*  Israel it's israel that wants to ceasefire. They always do this. They pretend america is making them [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1057.34s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I also don't think iran has the upper hand here at all [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1062.62s)]
*  I think iran has shown once again that they literally do not have [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1066.86s)]
*  Uh the power to defend themselves they did the same thing to hasbolla [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1072.3799999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about? Where is hasbolla right now israel destroyed? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1077.26s)]
*  Southern lebanon they destroyed parts of beirut [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1083.02s)]
*  In an effort to do a decapitation strike. Oh you mean in 2006, okay? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1086.86s)]
*  Yeah, this is a little bit different than 2006 as it stands because look at hasbolla now [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1092.2199999999998s)]
*  Israel basically did a decapitation strike on hasbolla [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1097.02s)]
*  Killed a bunch killed so many civilians in the process reduced city blocks in lebanon into rubble. Okay? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1100.9399999999998s)]
*  and in the process [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1108.4599999999998s)]
*  all they got was was was [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1110.3s)]
*  Less deterrence and and more of an ambition to finally strike iran without incurring significant penalties [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1113.6599999999999s)]
*  If hasbolla had its pre october 7 striking capabilities right now [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1121.5s)]
*  Israel would be incurring [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1126.9399999999998s)]
*  significantly more damage [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1129.7199999999998s)]
*  I understand that israelis are talking about how they can't survive a war of attrition is true [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1131.58s)]
*  That's 100 true. You are absolutely correct on this. Yes, you are correct on this. That is why i'm saying [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1135.74s)]
*  Okay [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1143.82s)]
*  Do not misunderstand my statement here [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1144.6999999999998s)]
*  israel [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1147.26s)]
*  Clearly cannot continue withstanding ballistic missile strikes from iran [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1148.4599999999998s)]
*  Unless america also joins the bombing campaigns [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1153.9s)]
*  And starts targeting ballistic missile launchers and takes advantage of the air superiority that israel and america has created at least in certain parts of iran [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1160.06s)]
*  Okay, that's the reason why israel's goal in this [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1169.02s)]
*  In this equation is to bring america into the forefront [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1173.58s)]
*  Of the war with iran [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1178.0800000000002s)]
*  Is to forcibly bring america and the american military [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1180.0800000000002s)]
*  Into its war with iran [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1184.24s)]
*  Israel wants more involvement from america so that iran's attention is shifted away from israel [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1186.88s)]
*  Towards the united states of america israel wants a costly and endless [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1193.52s)]
*  military campaign against iran so that they can destabilize [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1198.8000000000002s)]
*  The the iranian government and turn it into a fail state. Do you understand? It's a matter of whether or not [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1203.28s)]
*  Trump is also invested enough in in israel's goals here [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1210.08s)]
*  If israel continues escalating its bombing campaigns [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1215.44s)]
*  And iran continues striking israel and punishing israel [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1218.72s)]
*  Okay, then either [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1223.28s)]
*  Either israel will have to stand down [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1226.56s)]
*  Or it will try to do its very best to bring america into the conflict again. I said this [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1228.56s)]
*  last week [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1236.56s)]
*  When we saw the iranian ballistic missiles [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1238.56s)]
*  Uh and and the amount that they were sending [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1242.1599999999999s)]
*  Uh the the amount of ballistic missiles that iran was sending [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1245.6s)]
*  Got smaller [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1249.04s)]
*  But the success rate [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  Got significantly higher [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1253.28s)]
*  The moment that I saw a shahed drone [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1256.24s)]
*  successfully strike [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1259.66s)]
*  An israeli residential building was the moment where I was like it's over [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1261.52s)]
*  a shahed drone with the the [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1266.0s)]
*  tamir interceptors and the the iron dome that israel has [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1269.2s)]
*  Should never be able to penetrate and should never be able to hit israel at all. That means even [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1273.92s)]
*  their most robust arsenal [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1280.48s)]
*  Of smaller ballistics or smaller missile systems that are normally tasked with [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1282.8s)]
*  intercepting with a super high interception rate [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1289.1s)]
*  missiles that are being lobbed over the gaza boundary or missiles that are coming in from [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1292.8s)]
*  lebanon those those [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1298.16s)]
*  those missiles normally make short work of the [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1300.4s)]
*  Slower moving drones that are coming in from iran [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1304.24s)]
*  They're intercepted in [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1308.64s)]
*  Over iraq airspace they're intercepted over jordanian airspace. They can be intercepted with helicopters [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1310.8s)]
*  and if it if it passes through all of those [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1316.72s)]
*  If it passes through all of those defenses, then iron dome makes short work of it. The fact that iron dome was letting [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1320.72s)]
*  Uh shaheed drones [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1329.68s)]
*  actually hit [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1331.84s)]
*  Israel proper actually hit tel aviv implies that even their tamir interceptors are getting depleted. This means that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1333.28s)]
*  Israel either has to move america into the forefront of this, uh [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1340.48s)]
*  military campaign so that iran is is too focused on defending itself against a much stronger [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1345.52s)]
*  Military or they have to stand down. Here's chris kunzler's video on this. I already saw this is a great video [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1352.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a very smart video that iranian [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1358.88s)]
*  I'm glad that chris also shaved his mustache. I'm the last person to talk about other people's facial hair, but I [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1361.92s)]
*  I think the mustache wasn't working that good [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1367.84s)]
*  Has anyone else noticed that in spite of the fact that iranian missiles are still hitting tel aviv and causing pretty major destruction [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1371.04s)]
*  I mean look at this photo from this morning [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1379.92s)]
*  We are not hearing much information about this and in many ways this is hardly surprising [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1382.56s)]
*  The initial reaction to iran's retails assault on them was pretty damning for israel [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1388.48s)]
*  Most people were showing absolutely no sympathy for israel and were openly celebrating iran's attacks [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1394.32s)]
*  And so the israeli government went out to ensure that people were not posting videos of the destruction [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1401.04s)]
*  failed missile [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1407.36s)]
*  Interceptions or impacts as a whole but there is also a very important reason that this is not being shown [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1408.62s)]
*  And this is because please watch this [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1415.76s)]
*  You really need to watch this iran is winning and it isn't even close iran is doing asymmetrical warfare [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1418.5600000000002s)]
*  Not imperial warfare iran is winning [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1423.52s)]
*  Physical damage is not only the damage being done. How are you so bad at understanding that iran is winning? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1426.24s)]
*  Okay chatter. Yeah, you're right [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1431.8400000000001s)]
*  You're right predictive history said this in april [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1435.44s)]
*  And they're correct. It's the it's the it's this one [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1439.68s)]
*  A chinese professor that is now going viral [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1444.24s)]
*  that talks about how iran is winning this iran is going to win this war or is going to [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1448.8799999999999s)]
*  inevitably [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1455.4399999999998s)]
*  Destroy israel's air defense capabilities [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1457.52s)]
*  To be fair you've fallen for the iran is running out of missiles this past week [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1460.24s)]
*  No, I didn't say that iran was running out of missiles [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1463.6s)]
*  I said that given the limited amount of ballistic missiles that they were sending iran's missile [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1466.6399999999999s)]
*  I said there is a suspicion [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1472.48s)]
*  There's a reasonable there's a reasonable statement to make here that iran's ballistic missile launching capabilities might have actually diminished [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1474.0s)]
*  Not to the same degree [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1481.36s)]
*  That israel was claiming where they were like, oh we destroyed all of their launchers [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1483.2s)]
*  We destroyed all the launches. I never said that their launchers are all destroyed or a third of their launches are destroyed. I'm saying that [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1487.28s)]
*  looking at the the [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1494.8s)]
*  Uh looking at the intensity of the strikes looking at the amount of missiles that they're capable of launching initially versus [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1497.36s)]
*  The amount of missiles that they were capable of launching as of like yesterday [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1504.24s)]
*  It's clear that their launching capabilities have diminished. That is true. That is not untrue, but why launch as many if they are hitting [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1507.84s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1516.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, if their defense systems have been eroded if israel's defense systems have been eroded [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1518.48s)]
*  Isn't it more opportune for them to launch 100 right now and do one major s one major retaliatory strike that basically [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1523.92s)]
*  Brings the the iranian retaliation to the severity of israel's counter strikes and israel's preemptive strikes [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1533.44s)]
*  What are you talking about? There is no reason there is no reason for iran not to launch 200 missiles that will successfully hit [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1541.44s)]
*  Israel now and risk massive american intervention [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1548.3999999999999s)]
*  America already did intervention. What are you talking about anyways continue? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1552.0s)]
*  Because the first few days showed israel clearly hides military infrastructure within the vicinity of civilians [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1556.1599999999999s)]
*  They have continually baselessly claimed that in gaza it is okay to violate international law over and over again [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1564.0s)]
*  Because hamas are evil and use palestinians as human shields and that's why people get killed [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1571.84s)]
*  Thank you open presence for the hundred gift of subs [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1577.8400000000001s)]
*  But when it comes to israel it was increasingly clear as many people have known [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1580.56s)]
*  That israel hides military infrastructure near civilians. This was noted by a senior journalist ori goldberg [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1585.52s)]
*  Just a few days ago and israel has a hit this by the way is also [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1592.88s)]
*  This was the first couple of days of operation true promise three [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1598.24s)]
*  The first couple of days of operation true promise three showed us with 100% certainty [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1602.88s)]
*  That israel's anti-air defense capabilities were directly slammed in residential neighborhoods [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1608.64s)]
*  Ironically enough once again proving the point that everything israel says about its enemies is pure projection [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1614.46s)]
*  okay [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1621.1200000000001s)]
*  Pure projection when they say oh hamas is launching missiles from hospitals [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1622.4s)]
*  It's israel that is literally using human shields. Okay, if that's the assessment if this is like, uh the the human shields meta [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1627.54s)]
*  israel showed anyone with two eyes that can see the initial strikes that were taking place and the bombings [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1635.3s)]
*  That that successfully struck uh areas of tel aviv that it was actually [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1642.82s)]
*  Anti-air defense systems that were being targeted and the anti-air defense systems were being deployed from side of tel aviv in crowded residential neighborhoods [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1648.16s)]
*  israel has [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1655.78s)]
*  Its base of command the massad headquarters in the middle of in the heart of tel aviv israel has military installations in [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1657.38s)]
*  residential neighborhoods israel has intelligence [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1665.3600000000001s)]
*  uh intelligence installations in the middle of [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1668.3400000000001s)]
*  Residential neighborhoods where other businesses are doing commerce this much is true. So yes, of course israel was once again projecting [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1671.7s)]
*  history of this in [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1680.9s)]
*  2008 jonathan cook published this article about hasbolla's attacks on israel and what he said is that the military sensor [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1682.48s)]
*  Prevents publication of a considerable amount of things [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1690.32s)]
*  But what was clear is that israel's practices were endangering civilians because they were planting military infrastructure [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1693.52s)]
*  Near them using them as human shields and these are the reasons that you have stopped seeing images of these attacks [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1700.8s)]
*  Because israel was losing control of the narrative it was showing that all the things they had claimed about palestinians [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1707.8400000000001s)]
*  Were actually true of themselves [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1714.8s)]
*  not only that [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1717.28s)]
*  but also [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1718.64s)]
*  But also israel kept showing successful strikes to garner sympathy in the global stage [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1720.5600000000002s)]
*  Thinking that this would actually once again make israel look like the victim and that failed [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1727.8400000000001s)]
*  Spectacularly it didn't even move people's attention one bit [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1734.78s)]
*  Partially because while they were in the process of getting bombed and then continuing to bomb iran one [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1740.16s)]
*  They killed more people and more civilians in iran than iran [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1745.68s)]
*  Killed in israel, of course and on top of that they never stopped their ethnic cleansing campaign in gaza [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1750.72s)]
*  They never stopped their ethnic cleansing campaign in gaza. They kept killing people at the humanitarian aid drops [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1758.0s)]
*  the gaza humanitarian foundation if you remember is a is yet another violation of international human rights and and [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1764.24s)]
*  The geneva conventions engaging in perfidy using aid and aid delivery mechanisms as a as a military installation [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1770.56s)]
*  So, of course there was no sympathy for israel. They never even got any sort of sympathy whatsoever [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1778.56s)]
*  If anything people were either very quiet about israel finally being struck after months and months of doing ethnic cleansing in gaza [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1784.88s)]
*  Or they were openly celebrating it [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1793.2s)]
*  so they didn't even get their pr goals, uh out of the the uh [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1796.0s)]
*  The successful strikes no matter how hard they tried obviously if you go to cnn if you go to to fox news [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  They were talking about how devastating this has been for the civilian population of israel how destroyed they are how scared they are all the stuff [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1807.2s)]
*  But that fell on deaf ears. I don't think this changed the dynamic for even the western world at all and there we are [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1813.28s)]
*  This is part of the reason why i've said we're going to be regardless of this back and forth with iran and and israel [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1820.96s)]
*  israel's ambitions are over [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1828.6399999999999s)]
*  The moment that the ethnic cleansing ends either by force or because israel finalizes ethnic cleansing project [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1831.6s)]
*  And I hope that's not the case, but that is the assessment of the likes of chris hedges and many others [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1839.12s)]
*  That the israeli zionist project is done [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1844.08s)]
*  Is done [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1847.6s)]
*  This is the last [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1849.6s)]
*  This is the last bastion, okay [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1852.08s)]
*  the last [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1855.9199999999998s)]
*  the last attempt at winning as much territory as possible and and forcing [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1857.4399999999998s)]
*  America's hand to join the battle to the best of their ability and try to to redesign the region under israeli control [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1864.9599999999998s)]
*  Okay [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1873.6s)]

*  Oh, you're joking. Okay shameful [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1893.0400000000002s)]
*  Israel is small [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1896.0800000000002s)]
*  Iran is big [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1897.92s)]
*  Because there was a lot of it over the weekend the surging tensions in the middle east after those u.s [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1900.0s)]
*  Military strikes on iranian sites on saturday and then overnight iran fired a new barrage of missiles [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1904.1599999999999s)]
*  Against israel and israeli warplanes launched fresh attacks inside iran [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1909.9199999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile the iranian government is vowing a quote decisive response to the american attacks on three of its nuclear sites [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1914.3999999999999s)]
*  How those attacks do satellite images of those facilities show bomb craters and significant damage [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1920.72s)]
*  But how about underground the u.s military is still assessing that question and the full effects [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1926.96s)]
*  We've got complete coverage and a look at what is next but we're going to begin with deborah patter. She is inside [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1932.0s)]

*  Good morning, tony. Well several countries across the middle east have criticized [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1940.48s)]
*  The u.s strikes on iran's nuclear sites calling for diplomacy [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1944.72s)]
*  Amid fears the war could spiral out of control now this as israel and iran [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1949.28s)]
*  continued to trade strikes [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1955.26s)]
*  This morning sirens warned of another wave of iranian missiles this one exploding in ashtot [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1957.9s)]
*  And just hours after the weekend's u.s strikes iran unleashed a barrage of rockets [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1967.42s)]
*  Devastating a huge residential neighborhood in tel aviv [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1974.44s)]
*  All that remained of this building were the hollowed out shells of apartments where people once lived [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1979.66s)]
*  There were no fatalities [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1986.62s)]
*  Israel has also not lit up its bombing campaign on iran [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1989.4199999999998s)]
*  And stout yeah, the ashtot attack was attack was on a plan do they know [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=1995.6599999999999s)]
*  Because it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial for israel to show how weak they are [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2000.06s)]
*  Uh, especially how weak their infrastructure is [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2005.98s)]
*  Just like they stopped talking about the hypha oil refinery that was successfully struck and was shut down [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2009.1s)]
*  For an extended period of time that only came after israel blew up the the oil depot in tehran, by the way [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2015.58s)]
*  Israel blew up the oil depot in tehran [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2022.9399999999998s)]
*  and then iran in retaliation blew up the hypha oil refinery [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2025.8999999999999s)]
*  And and took it out of commission israel hid that fact and the only reason why we found out about it is because [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2030.4599999999998s)]
*  other people had [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2036.78s)]
*  Filmed it on their phones while it was happening and the refinery was on fire [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2038.4599999999998s)]
*  And then also the the hypha oil refinery had to release a statement [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2043.26s)]
*  uh in uh in their [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2048.94s)]
*  They had to release a statement to their shareholders. Basically they were getting decommissioned [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2051.2599999999998s)]
*  Israel is also uh [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2056.7799999999997s)]
*  Successfully striking around the ports as well from what I understand [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2059.16s)]
*  So are not israel. Sorry iran is striking israeli ports, uh around the israeli ports as well [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2062.94s)]
*  So they have kept up tremendous pressure [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2069.34s)]
*  They've kept up tremendous pressure on israeli society. They've kept up tremendous pressure on the israeli economy [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2074.1400000000003s)]
*  Thousands of iranians rallied in tehran to protest israeli and u.s. Strikes [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2080.52s)]
*  The u.s. Has no right to tell us what to do said ali we must slap america hard [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2088.78s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister abbas arachi is in moscow today. This is irgc propaganda [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2094.7799999999997s)]
*  Please please please don't give them the platform or show this please these people are being paid by the irgc [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2101.66s)]

*  IRGC cbs mornings [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2112.04s)]
*  I guess is uh what the communist uh [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  communist [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2118.2799999999997s)]
*  Broadcasting service mornings in the pocket of the irgc for talks with president vladimir putin [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2120.5s)]
*  President trump. I thank you. Mr. Benjamin netanyahu has thanked the u.s [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2127.1400000000003s)]
*  For stepping in and offered prayers for president trump [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2132.92s)]
*  Saying he had driven out evil from the world [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2139.0s)]
*  Netanyahu has also flirted with regime change in iran [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2144.26s)]
*  It was already engaged in one we asked the former ambassador to the un gelad erdan if this was a fantasy [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2148.6800000000003s)]
*  it's not up to us to [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2156.6s)]
*  Top of the regime. It's up to the iranian people [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2159.32s)]
*  Senior israeli officials. Do you think showing the american audience that iranians are white would help reduce the bloodlust of some conservatives? Yes [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2163.48s)]
*  I think unironically [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2171.8s)]
*  As much as I get annoyed when people show like tehran and go look this is just like a european capital [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2173.8s)]
*  Like that is not the only reason why people should be uh worthy of dignity and humanity and survive [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2180.1200000000003s)]
*  And and not be bombed. Okay [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2186.28s)]
*  But yes, that does play a major role in the way like a lot of americans analyze the situation [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2189.0s)]
*  I'm not even kidding like you'll see i've seen so many posts like this [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2194.6000000000004s)]
*  Where where people just show tehran [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2200.44s)]
*  Like normal tehran some women are covered some women are not they go what the how is this possible? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2202.92s)]
*  Because that's how stupid the average american is and the average westerner literally thinks iranians are like living in huts [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2208.6s)]
*  And riding camels to work. Okay, that's also partially why the whole like this was iran before the revolution posts [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2216.52s)]
*  slap so hard for the dumbest americans where they think like [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2224.12s)]
*  Iran was only like a western adjacent nation under the shah as though iran didn't [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2227.4s)]
*  They never they don't even factor in what iran used to look like in the 50s [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2233.4s)]
*  For example iranians are more sophisticated and smarter than oslo you get shunned by your whole family if you're not a doctor engineer lawyer [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2238.2s)]
*  the iranian public is also more educated iranian women have [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2244.52s)]
*  uh [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2249.0s)]
*  More educational attainment than even american women do that's like the other side of the story that is like insane where people that [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2250.28s)]
*  That people that will turn around and be like iranian women are not allowed to leave their homes [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2255.72s)]
*  They're not allowed to get an education. It's so stupid. It's just wrong [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2259.8s)]
*  It's it's additionally dumb for an american to say that iran is a stem nation [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2264.36s)]
*  Okay, they are the most stem cell ass nation. You'll be shocked to find out palestinians broadly are also, uh [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2269.88s)]
*  incredibly educated as well in spite of living under a ruthless blockade in gaza and a ruthless and [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2277.38s)]
*  cruel and bloody apartheid for 77 years this does not mean that uh, this is not the the only [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2284.7599999999998s)]
*  metric of of worthiness for humanity for the record [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2292.8399999999997s)]
*  People think every single muslim country is a cross between isis throwing gay people off the roof and the taliban don't let women do anything [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2297.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's so goddamn annoying. It's so frustrating and it's also it's always [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2303.72s)]
*  The principle is always the same too. It works even harder because islamophobia is like this [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2309.08s)]
*  ever present a [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2314.12s)]
*  Normalizing force that makes people comfortable [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2315.8599999999997s)]
*  with this bigoted attitude [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2318.92s)]
*  but [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2321.24s)]
*  Ironically enough. It's always the same principle with america's adversaries, right? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2322.52s)]
*  like the example I always use [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2327.08s)]
*  is [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2329.7999999999997s)]
*  uh when the new york times wrote the new york times wrote an article about beijing [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2330.6s)]
*  And how they had this like new museum that they had, uh [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2336.7599999999998s)]
*  Created in beijing and they were saying like this white washes china's bloody history and I was like that's a museum [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2340.2799999999997s)]
*  That's every museum. Have you been to an american museum? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2347.24s)]
*  Like that's literally what museums do you're describing the the function of a museum? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2351.48s)]
*  in a country, but because it's a chinese museum you're like that's this is a [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2358.2s)]
*  unacceptable, this is uh, you know [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2364.02s)]
*  This is whitewashing, uh chinese history it's like yeah, no shit [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2366.34s)]
*  That's what every museum does that and also they they house a bunch of stolen artifacts for the most part [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2370.58s)]
*  Okay, and and [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2377.38s)]
*  I mean, I still love museums by the way. I'm not saying museums are bad in general, but like [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2379.78s)]
*  We we don't actually have like the same [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2384.9s)]
*  Metrics for our foreign adversaries and this is yet another example of this like [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2388.9s)]
*  Is the islamic republic of iran? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2392.98s)]

*  upon the the secular population of iranians [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2399.38s)]
*  Absolutely, and at times this has created real instability [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2403.36s)]
*  At times this has been a a threat to [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2408.18s)]
*  Its own power, right? This is correct. This is 100 correct [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2411.7s)]
*  But the solution to this is not bombing campaigns and forced military intervention [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2416.34s)]
*  And and a a puppet state that is uh implemented in the process that will play along with [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2421.7999999999997s)]
*  uh western ambitions in the region [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2428.9199999999996s)]
*  And in an effort to also justify its control over the society like the shah did create this ruthless force [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2431.8799999999997s)]
*  A torturous force like the savak, right? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2439.4799999999996s)]
*  That's not the that's not the solution. That's not how you liberate iran as a matter of fact [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2443.16s)]
*  bombing campaigns such as this one [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2448.2s)]
*  Only create additional instability that forces the public to focus on that [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2450.4399999999996s)]
*  focus on self-defense [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2455.96s)]
*  And it sets back the stage for any sort of civil struggle that might happen organically in these countries. You understand? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2457.96s)]
*  It's very very stupid [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2464.8399999999997s)]
*  To think that we can like bomb iran into [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2467.56s)]
*  Being a more woke and gay country. It's idiotic just like you can't bomb [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2470.8399999999997s)]
*  Georgia into being more woke. It's like you can't bomb america into being more woke [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2476.6s)]
*  You can't bomb iran into being more woke either [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2482.6s)]
*  That's not how this goes [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2485.48s)]
*  Told us the ball is now in iran's court. It can choose to end the conflict by negotiating a deal [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2487.6400000000003s)]
*  But if it retaliates against the u.s that could spark a wider war gail. Those are the fighters just [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2493.6400000000003s)]
*  Leaving israeli airspace now, let's go to weezha jang. She's at the white house [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2500.44s)]
*  We that's so trump is like come on it's time for peace i'm gonna tell israel it's time for peace as well [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2503.48s)]
*  Meanwhile israeli fighter jets congratulations world. It's time for peace israel's like nah, actually it's fine. We're not not time for us [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2509.72s)]
*  Yeah, I guess israel didn't get this memo a white house official told told me that [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2518.3599999999997s)]
*  Uh the goal, uh, the trump's goal now is to end the war and he's gonna make it clear to israeli prime minister [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2523.64s)]
*  Benjamin and yahu we want to deal and we don't want a new war. Hmm [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2528.12s)]
*  Interesting seems seems strange to me that that's not [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2531.64s)]
*  Seemingly that's not happening. How odd [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2536.04s)]
*  Anyway, as i've talked about there is no appetite [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2539.16s)]
*  From the american public broadly for war with iran [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2543.24s)]
*  right [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2548.04s)]
*  Not that it matters [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2549.3199999999997s)]
*  Because there is no democratic process [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2550.9199999999996s)]
*  There is no democratic process [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2554.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh when it comes to foreign policy foreign policy is uniparty all that matters is is our goals our ambition our interests [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2558.52s)]
*  and and the public's appetite [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2566.84s)]
*  For more war or less war is I mean it's good if the public is excited about more war like it like they were after 9 11 [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2569.7999999999997s)]
*  Having said that it's very clear that [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2577.7999999999997s)]
*  disinterest in war [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2580.92s)]
*  And anger and resentment towards more war is not going to stop this administration [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2583.0s)]
*  From doing whatever the fuck it wants to do [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2587.56s)]
*  Okay [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2589.4s)]
*  Here's the winner of nobel peace prize in iran says israel's attack on evan prison in tehran has created a horrific situation for the inmates [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2589.88s)]
*  The jail's hospital slash clinic has been destroyed injured prisoners are not being attended to and the regime is blocking families from getting news [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2596.12s)]
*  Most political prisoners are held in evan. So what happened? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2602.28s)]
*  What happened was yesterday israel struck? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2606.84s)]
*  Like a last night israel struck the evan prison [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2609.8799999999997s)]
*  Uh where a lot of the uh, a lot of the political prisoners of the islamic republic are being held [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2613.72s)]
*  They did that because they thought they could uh, they could force like uh, like a prison break basically, but of course you can't do that by bombing [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2619.3199999999997s)]
*  You can't do that by bombing the prison [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2627.08s)]
*  So the prison health facility has been destroyed prisoners remain in wards with heightened security conditions are being moved injured prisoners [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2629.08s)]
*  Have no place to be transferred and treated and due to war conditions [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2634.68s)]
*  They are not being transferred to hospitals outside the prison [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2637.3999999999996s)]
*  A number of prisoners have not yet spoken to their families and there are rumors that prisoners are being transferred to prisons around tehran [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2639.72s)]
*  And families are in fear [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2644.7599999999998s)]
*  And worry when prisoners are transferred in these conditions, we will not have accurate information about them [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2646.8399999999997s)]
*  We do not know how many conscripts were killed nor do we know how many of the families of prisoners who went to evine's [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2650.8399999999997s)]
*  Prosecutor's office to follow up on the status of their loved ones were killed [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2655.48s)]
*  The government is not providing information and we don't have accurate information either [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2658.3599999999997s)]
*  I call an international organization to work with the release of all prisoners in these war-torn conditions. So ironically enough given that [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2661.8s)]
*  israel's goal here is to cause further instability in iran [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2669.56s)]
*  by uh by forcing a prison break [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2673.48s)]
*  their only method to do so [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2676.52s)]
*  is [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2678.52s)]
*  by bombing [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2679.32s)]
*  From afar and of course bombing from afar instead of causing a prison break is only harming the political prisoners [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2680.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you want the political prisoners to stay in prison? No, that's not what i'm saying at all [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2687.56s)]
*  But it's once again a own goal by israel. That's do you not understand the point? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2692.6s)]
*  This is this is no different than israel being like don't you want the gays to be liberated in iran free them by what? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2697.56s)]
*  Killing them with bombs because that's what happens. Don't you want the gays in gaza to be liberated by what? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2704.2799999999997s)]
*  Being bombed and starved by the israeli, uh bombing campaign is that [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2711.7999999999997s)]
*  That's not gonna liberate them israel's goals here is not the liberation of anti-regime [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2716.12s)]
*  Dissidents and prisoners that are unjustly being trapped in avine [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2722.26s)]
*  It is to cause chaos and instability. Do you not understand? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2726.6s)]
*  Yeah notable that while trump is telling the media that he wants the end of the war israel's carrying out one of the most brutal attacks [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2731.8s)]
*  On around thus far. They're currently on their sixth or seventh wave of airstrikes [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2736.92s)]
*  Of the day [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2741.0s)]
*  Like do you think america should have bombed aushawitz by to to liberate aushawitz. Do you think that would have worked better? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2742.28s)]
*  What are we talking about? Hell? Yeah, brother. I got a hammer and everything's looking quite like a nail [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2748.2000000000003s)]
*  I got i got a hammer in my hand and everything looks like a nail to me. I'm american [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2754.1200000000003s)]
*  Actually was a bad example because they invaded essentially. Yeah [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2759.8s)]
*  They did they didn't bomb it. What are you talking about? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2763.6400000000003s)]
*  Exactly that is the the ussr's liberation of aushawitz came because they [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2767.2400000000002s)]
*  successfully [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2773.5400000000004s)]

*  Obviously, they would never be able to do that. They would get destroyed [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2782.76s)]
*  common a [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2786.9s)]

*  How many with another tweet this time in english trump just took a victory lap. I know we already covered it [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2799.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we covered it already [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2805.48s)]
*  Trump basically took the off-ramp [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2807.64s)]
*  israel seemingly has not gotten the message though [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2810.2599999999998s)]

*  We can't have you it was an amazing response. It was and we all know that's not true people inside don't but what do you think? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2825.0800000000004s)]
*  We'll get to be back with everybody. What what a weekend. Um, I believe joey is is largely right if not totally right [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2831.7200000000003s)]
*  Wait, what is this? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2838.1200000000003s)]
*  Senior advisor the IRGC commander in chief general jabari while we confront the americans [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2839.8s)]
*  We will simultaneously continue our own plans operations to suppress crushing to blur the vile child-killing criminal israel [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2843.88s)]
*  We will not stop hitting israel. We will respond independently to the u.s [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2850.76s)]
*  And that response is due to their attacks on our on our nuclear facilities and their malicious behavior [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2854.2000000000003s)]

*  They're literally doing the yemen method [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2863.7200000000003s)]
*  I just realized they're doing ansarallah. They're ansarallah posting [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2866.12s)]
*  This is what yemen was trying to do obviously to limited success because they don't have the same striking capabilities as iran does [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2871.32s)]
*  Clearly, but this is the yemen method. They're like listen america [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2879.7200000000003s)]

*  In two phases first with our drones, which I am familiar with and can say [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2910.92s)]
*  Uh, maybe even more precise and powerful than our missiles 40 of our drones were launched to hit the intended targets [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2914.6s)]
*  And today israel is in a situation where even after we launched around 20 missiles [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2919.64s)]
*  They were unable to do anything in response our 40 drones and 20 missiles struck exactly where we intended and caused severe consequences [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2923.64s)]
*  I say to you and the viewers but let me emphasize america's main assets in the region are not as ships or bases [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2931.0s)]
*  Those are highly vulnerable israel's he misspoke. He meant us [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2936.04s)]

*  Israel has realized it is losing and it must lose it must be destroyed [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2946.92s)]
*  It must be crushed the people of the region must be freed from this wicked criminal [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2950.04s)]
*  This is part of a broader strategic package we have with america as you mentioned earlier [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2953.48s)]
*  That's precisely why the americans have come to try to save israel, but they will not succeed and will suffer damage themselves [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2957.88s)]
*  The outcome of this story remains to be seen. I mean iranian generals talk a big game. Okay, ayatollah [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2964.04s)]
*  Uh hamenei also talks a big game. What matters is not what they say on television what matters is [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2971.0s)]
*  What matters is what they do [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2978.12s)]
*  but listen to my [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2980.68s)]
*  Listen to uh, uh my words at least or my assessment of this [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2983.64s)]
*  What is happening? The camera's being extra wonky today. I don't like it [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2988.44s)]
*  Okay, this might be a little bit better [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2993.24s)]
*  so israel's more offensive campaigns [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=2995.8799999999997s)]
*  with its air force right now [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3000.44s)]
*  Is happening because they have more offensive capabilities than they do defensive capabilities [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3003.56s)]
*  Israel is operating with the the best defense is a uh is an immense offense [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3011.56s)]
*  Attitude because the more they run out of ammo on their anti-air defense capabilities [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3019.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh, and and those are much much harder to re-up and re-arm [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3027.08s)]
*  because of how costly that is [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3033.0s)]
*  because these are sophisticated missile systems and they're expensive and and [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3035.56s)]
*  Especially the the big boys the ballistic missile [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3042.1s)]
*  defenses are much much more costly than the tamir interceptors even though the single tamir interceptor the [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3045.4s)]
*  price of a single tamir interceptors two hundred thousand dollars [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3052.12s)]
*  Okay, and those can't stop the ballistic missiles. You can deploy 20 of them if you want none of them actually intercept a single ballistic missile [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3055.4s)]
*  Especially not a hypersonic one [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3063.08s)]
*  So so basically because they don't have the capacity to play defense [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3065.88s)]
*  They have to continue playing [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3071.96s)]
*  Super hard offense and the more israel strikes iran the more iran continues to strike israel with increased intensity [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3074.2s)]
*  Israel knows they cannot survive a war of attrition without the without the americans playing a role a significant role [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3083.48s)]
*  And I don't mean just like a defensive role [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3091.16s)]
*  Because america has already been playing a defensive role in this and it's obvious that you know [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3094.12s)]
*  Ballistic missiles are still piercing through the iron dome the aero systems david sling and even the fad launchers that america sent [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3098.04s)]
*  Okay, if they can't defend why won't iran hit their air bases you think iran is not hitting their air bases iran is hitting their bases [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3104.9199999999996s)]
*  you don't see it because like their air bases are far away from [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3113.24s)]
*  Uh their air bases are far away from from the public eye and therefore [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3118.12s)]
*  Uh, their air bases are far away from the public eye and also their military installations [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3122.92s)]
*  So the israeli government does not allow any sort of filming of of impact sites on air bases an f-35 down by [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3127.4s)]
*  No, this is fake too, man. Stop [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3135.08s)]
*  What is [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3137.88s)]
*  This is correct. This is asman is correct [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3139.2400000000002s)]
*  If this this video [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3141.88s)]
*  I don't know where it's from. I don't know [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3144.6s)]
*  Uh, I don't know where this video is from and I don't think it's an f-35 [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3147.08s)]
*  The reason why I don't think it's an f-35 and I don't even know if it's from iran [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3150.8399999999997s)]
*  Is because if iran struck a f-35 successfully and downed it they would release photos [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3155.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay, they would release photos of it. They would put it on every poster [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3163.64s)]
*  This would showcase that america's latest gen fighter [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3168.52s)]
*  That is a multi-role [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3172.04s)]
*  Is a dud is a complete dud and I know this because they have successfully struck [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3174.2799999999997s)]
*  drones [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3180.8399999999997s)]
*  They've successfully struck and shot down israeli drones [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3182.12s)]
*  Why do I know that they've successfully shot down israeli drones because the moment that those israeli drones are shut uh struck and and [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3185.48s)]
*  successfully intercepted [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3193.8599999999997s)]
*  the iranian outlets will make a big show of it understandably [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3196.2799999999997s)]
*  And also israel will release a statement [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3200.6200000000003s)]
*  The israeli military command will release a statement saying oh our drone was struck [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3204.38s)]
*  It's fine. It's negligible. They have no [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3209.26s)]
*  Uh, they have no uh information that they can derive out of this drone [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3212.6200000000003s)]
*  It's not a big deal bro serbia shot down one b2 bomber in the 1990s and they made a whole ass song about it [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3216.78s)]
*  Yeah, israeli just are mostly using standoff air launch missiles to avoid air defenses. It wasn't a b2. It was a f117 [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3222.38s)]
*  Yes, that's the that's the one that um [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3230.54s)]
*  That's the one that chris hedges was talking about right f117 nighthawk. It wasn't a b2 bomber [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3233.9s)]
*  No b2 has ever been shot down. It was an f1. Oh my god [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3238.7000000000003s)]
*  I have so many plane autists and so many missile autists in the chat respect respect to all the chatters that instantly [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3241.1800000000003s)]
*  F117 my beloved the f35 wreckage is also a [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3248.46s)]
*  tremendously important a potential f35 wreckage is a is a [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3253.6400000000003s)]
*  Tremendously important wreckage dude the amount of intelligence that you can give to russia and china off of that is so insane [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3257.58s)]
*  It's worth numerous dong fang missiles. Okay [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3264.94s)]
*  I don't know how many dong fang missiles you can get in in response to a the wreckage [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3268.46s)]
*  Of a f35. Are you kidding me? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3274.7s)]
*  Unlimited dong fang missiles [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3278.36s)]
*  To iran [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3281.34s)]
*  for for a crumb of intelligence [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3283.2599999999998s)]
*  To offer the chinese government or the russian government russia would finally russia would send every s 400 they have [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3286.64s)]
*  to iran [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3294.7999999999997s)]
*  Lifetime supply of dong fang missiles all of the dong fang missiles for you, sir [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3296.3999999999996s)]
*  It's such a massive deal when we dropped one off to vincent in the south china scene in 2023. Yeah [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3300.56s)]
*  the only thing that i've seen [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3306.72s)]
*  The only thing that i've seen so far is just like ai shit about the f35 [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3308.8799999999997s)]
*  Far as new minister of comms is saying that after they shot down a drone they discovered it was using the american iridium satellite network [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3313.46s)]
*  Iridium was initially funded by saudi bin laden group. Yeah, I saw that too and also saved from bankruptcy by the dod in 2000 [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3318.98s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that as well [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3326.3399999999997s)]
*  um [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3328.1s)]
*  There's also some interesting some uh washington post releases, which I suspect is a release from masad [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3328.8199999999997s)]
*  So I assume this is like more propaganda the israel allowed this to be released [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3334.98s)]
*  The washington post published an audio file in which masad agents contact 20 irgc commanders and give them 12 hours to flee iran [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3339.62s)]
*  Or they and their families will be killed which of course is also a war crime by the way [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3344.82s)]
*  Like openly admitting that you're going to kill people's children and their families like you're going to kill civilians is insane [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3349.3s)]
*  This is a recording of a call that took place between an israeli intelligence operative and a senior iranian general on june 13th [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3357.7000000000003s)]
*  The voice of the israeli intelligence operator operative had been digitally altered an audio recording obtained by the post [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3363.78s)]
*  The post prepared its own translation of the conversation and removed the audio [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3369.14s)]
*  Remove the voice of the iranian general to avoid identifying him [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3372.9s)]
*  Hello commander, he says hello. He says hello [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3378.34s)]
*  Can you hear me and you are i'm calling from a country which two hours ago sent salami bagheri and uh shamkhani to hell [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=3386.18s)]

*  Because if you remember when operation true promise 2 was happening there was a bus stop, uh attack that took place [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4092.32s)]
*  Simultaneously that was an iranian operation for sure [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4098.46s)]

*  Exploding the element of surprise she says this strikes at over 100 sites in the first 12 hours including significant senior military officials [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4241.92s)]
*  civilian scientists several university professors including the president of azad university in tehran [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4247.68s)]

*  She calls it a psychological as well as a tactical campaign aimed at inducing [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4255.92s)]
*  Fragmentation or loss of control and yet within hours iran began to reconstitute his defenses a miscalculation [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4259.58s)]
*  She argues shattered israel's assumptions. Let's take a look talk to you [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4264.72s)]
*  But give us your analysis of what we're seeing unfold with this u.s [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4268.48s)]
*  Israeli war against iran the timing of it and what you see as the agenda at play [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4273.04s)]
*  Um, I mean you start with a with a pretty um, um, accurate and comprehensive [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4280.08s)]
*  um [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4288.08s)]
*  Analysis of what has happened and I just want to I guess add to that and let me start by this point that it is [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4289.92s)]
*  Very important to recognize that we are at a historic inflection point [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4297.44s)]
*  Um in history one that is very much rooted in october 7th [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4303.04s)]
*  anti-colonial operation of al-aqsa [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4308.9400000000005s)]
*  Which has essentially set the motions [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4311.84s)]
*  Of the forces that are going to shape and are shaping the very formation of the new world order [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4315.360000000001s)]
*  And both specifically globally but also specifically in west asia [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4321.360000000001s)]
*  Um [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4326.56s)]
*  so the israeli regime appears to be executing a three-phase operation or plan against iran and [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4327.68s)]
*  Unlike its prior aggressions, you know in yemen in syria and lebanon [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4337.280000000001s)]
*  And of course the ongoing genocide in palestine this aggression is [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4342.08s)]
*  encountering a radically different material conditions, um, hence the [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4346.56s)]
*  Um different forces that we're seeing at play [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4352.4800000000005s)]
*  And i'm going to go through um the three phases that I think um have unfolded or unfolding [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4355.36s)]
*  um, and maybe we can we can [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4361.4400000000005s)]
*  Discuss that together [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4365.04s)]
*  Uh, and the very first ways obviously was of what you what you explained [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4366.56s)]
*  Uh, the operation was very much designed to target the commander structure [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4371.04s)]
*  And inflicted wide-spread terror on civilians by exploiting the element of surprise [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4376.160000000001s)]
*  and this phase was successful for the most part in my opinion because [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4382.64s)]
*  While iran was at the negotiating table as you mentioned [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4387.120000000001s)]
*  There was a coordinated wave of strikes targeting iranian civilians [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4392.0s)]
*  Residentials and military sites as well as nuclear facilities in in in natanz in the first in the first round of its [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4396.540000000001s)]
*  Of strikes that are on there and were on their iaea safeguard, right? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4403.84s)]
*  um, so the victims of the first day's [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4409.4400000000005s)]
*  attack including [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4412.8s)]
*  significant [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4415.1s)]
*  senior military officials civilian scientists we had a university we had several university professors including the president of [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4416.4800000000005s)]
*  azad university in tehran one of the prominent universities in iran and and women and children [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4425.6s)]
*  And they were overwhelmingly located in residential neighborhoods [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4432.24s)]
*  Many were killed in their homes. The attack was took place in the middle of the night and many were killed [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4436.719999999999s)]
*  With their families sleeping in the middle of the night [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4443.36s)]
*  And while several high-profile assassinations as I said, um [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4447.28s)]
*  Wherever assassinated five out of 12 that they aimed to assassinate [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4453.5199999999995s)]
*  Um were killed in in the first night [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4458.740000000001s)]
*  and [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4462.18s)]
*  the [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4463.38s)]
*  um [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4464.820000000001s)]
*  Intent was to paralyze iran's commander structure and in a still a mass sphere through the targeting of civilians [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4465.780000000001s)]
*  And in the first few hours [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4472.900000000001s)]
*  Iran's air defense was also compromised significantly. Um, that was the [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4475.3s)]
*  That for sure was the most sophisticated aspect of the of the massada operations [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4481.46s)]
*  like that, uh, I would say that in and of itself is like [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4486.76s)]
*  that wasn't even like the uh, uh, the act of terrorism that the the also sophisticated but an act of terrorism that was the the [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4490.76s)]
*  The bombing campaigns from the beepers [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4499.72s)]
*  um [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4502.36s)]
*  The fact that they were able to deeply penetrate [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4504.12s)]
*  The irgc and deeply penetrate iranian society so they could actually have a drone building facility in the heart of tehran [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4506.6s)]
*  is [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4515.5599999999995s)]
*  Insane and once they were able to dismantle some of the air forces [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4516.679999999999s)]
*  Then they turned around and and bombed all these people then they came in with the violence and and it [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4520.599999999999s)]
*  It limb which which limited the capacity of of the state to defend their airspace [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4526.839999999999s)]
*  And as a result of that, um over 100 strategic sites [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4533.24s)]
*  And civilian objects were hit within the first six to 12 hours, I believe and um [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4538.679999999999s)]
*  Significant damage was done [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4546.0199999999995s)]
*  so the objective of of [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4548.839999999999s)]
*  The the attack was not only tactical militarily, but it was also [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4551.879999999999s)]
*  Psychological, right? So it was very much to induce this fragmentation of loss [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4556.179999999999s)]
*  of control [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4563.0s)]
*  um, and what was significant and I think um, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4564.44s)]
*  Arguably unprecedented was was the fact that iran, uh was able to observe the [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4568.599999999999s)]
*  The attack and so incredibly quickly [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4575.48s)]
*  um [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4579.16s)]
*  Return retain its structure and come back to an offense mode [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4581.32s)]
*  And this was partly a miscalculation of israel. Um, it was the depth of iran's revolutionary structure [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4588.04s)]
*  um and [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4595.96s)]
*  Within hours within six hours, I believe six seven hours the command was restructured [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4597.5599999999995s)]
*  Air defense was restored and offensive capacity was activated [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4603.419999999999s)]
*  And it was less than 24 hours [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4608.7s)]
*  If not, it was like 12 hours that the first round of attacks of iran in self-defense [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4610.78s)]
*  Um was launched, right? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4617.5s)]
*  um, and the first round were [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4620.139999999999s)]
*  Uh firm they were uh [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4623.0199999999995s)]
*  Calibrated and they were targeted. Um at important military objectives [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4625.96s)]
*  Um, and they also passed through it's very significant to note that [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4631.42s)]
*  The fact that the hits were and are continuously successful [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4635.82s)]
*  Um in occupied territories, um is due to the fact that it goes through the missiles go through [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4640.7s)]
*  Multi-layered interceptions with the most advanced military equipment of the collectivist, right? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4646.679999999999s)]
*  The first layer is probably a starts in in one of the arab reactionary regimes jordan probably [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4652.0599999999995s)]
*  In terms of intelligence and it goes through until it hits the target so there are multi-layered [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4658.06s)]
*  levels of of [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4664.3s)]
*  Interceptions that these missiles pass [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4666.28s)]
*  and um, you know iran developed this um [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4669.66s)]
*  Doing so, um, it completely disturbed the israeli strategic assumptions and revealed that [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4675.82s)]
*  the readiness of the state [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4681.9800000000005s)]
*  That has spent decades especially preparing for this moment, especially after the um western-backed iraqi [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4684.54s)]
*  Invasion of iran between 18 [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4692.78s)]
*  um [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4696.0599999999995s)]
*  With just like with yemen [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4697.74s)]
*  A strike [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4702.139999999999s)]
*  in the nah is [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4704.0599999999995s)]
*  Uh is is going to be costly of course in terms of the civilian, uh casualties [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4706.78s)]
*  but [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4712.56s)]
*  the society's attitude towards that sort of thing is I think very different than a [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4713.52s)]

*  The appetite that they have for [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4739.78s)]

*  Is very very different than uh what the iranian society or what people in yemen can withstand [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4752.099999999999s)]
*  Not to say that like iran and yemen are the same. They're not because iran is also [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4758.5s)]

*  Endless bombing campaigns than even the people in yemen are [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4768.34s)]
*  Because all the people in yemen have known is death and destruction from western forces and western-backed militias [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4771.54s)]

*  the position given the position of of iran on the global stage like there is [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4787.54s)]
*  More of an understanding that this is a a strike that's happening that didn't have to happen if iran for example [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4793.14s)]

*  To a detriment to iran and iranian safety and security, but I think all of that [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4830.820000000001s)]
*  was was [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4836.820000000001s)]
*  showing [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4839.12s)]
*  Like what what that was showing to the public was that iran was not willing to [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4843.06s)]
*  Bargain with its citizens lives [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4847.54s)]

*  in the eyes of its [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4855.0599999999995s)]
*  public [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4856.66s)]
*  They did not [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4857.62s)]
*  They basically didn't [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4859.0599999999995s)]
*  Poke the beast if you will they didn't poke the beast at all and then the beast still came for them [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4862.339999999999s)]
*  Which is precisely why I think [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4869.54s)]
*  I think [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4871.86s)]
*  Israel was not able to take advantage of the initial [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4873.0599999999995s)]
*  Destabilization that they thought they would get they didn't poke the bear and the bear still came for iran [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4877.36s)]
*  and then all of a sudden people recognize like [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4882.74s)]
*  You know, this is this is outside of the islamic republic's control. This is not something that they brought [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4885.38s)]
*  uh to [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4893.0599999999995s)]
*  There's not something that they brought to us. That's what I think. That's why I think it's like, uh in spite of the negative [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4895.0599999999995s)]
*  Feelings that a lot of iranian society, especially secular [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4902.0199999999995s)]
*  forces within israel and iranian society felt towards the government [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4905.78s)]
*  in this amount of [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4910.099999999999s)]
*  instability [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4912.16s)]
*  Anyway, let's see what jeffrey's is saying donald trump and his actions [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4913.78s)]
*  Which do not appear to be consistent with the united states constitution [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4919.78s)]
*  Takes unilateral offensive military action without seeking the approval of the united states [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4924.9s)]
*  congress [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4932.339999999999s)]
*  the use of military force [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4934.179999999999s)]
*  Which is offensive in nature [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4937.86s)]
*  Must be approved by the house and the senate that's according to the constitution. It's not optional [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4941.299999999999s)]
*  Donald it's not the framers of the constitution actually gave congress the power to declare war for a reason [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4950.74s)]
*  I'm losing my mind because if you don't talk about the real issue here [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4958.26s)]
*  This is just seasoning. This is a problem not the problem [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4963.86s)]
*  the problem is [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4969.78s)]
*  Allowing israel to run its dick all over every orifice of american [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4972.08s)]
*  american foreign policy [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4977.38s)]
*  The problem is going to war with iran at the behest of israel a problem in the process is doing it [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4978.98s)]
*  Unconstitutionally it's so strange that these guys think [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4985.360000000001s)]
*  That there is an unlimited amount of resentment that they could tap into [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4990.02s)]
*  right now [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4995.3s)]
*  and an [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4996.74s)]
*  impossible impossible to defend decision made by the trump administration [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=4998.24s)]
*  and these dipshits are basically taking the dumbest most like rule abiding [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5003.22s)]
*  aspect of this process they're they're mad about the process in which [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5009.54s)]
*  These strikes were conducted while simultaneously giving credit to why those strikes should have been conducted to begin with [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5014.74s)]
*  By saying iran must never have a nuclear weapon if you say that [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5022.099999999999s)]
*  Then you don't understand why people voted for trump to begin with nobody gives up about the process open presence [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5028.179999999999s)]
*  Thank you for the hundred get this up people care about going to war with iran and potential retaliation from iran [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5034.259999999999s)]
*  They don't care that it was done unilaterally. I mean i'm sure people care about that. It was done unilaterally as well [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5041.46s)]
*  But like that's not the main concern here [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5046.58s)]
*  Trump does everything unilaterally [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5052.1s)]
*  He doesn't give a shit even things that he could get across through congressional approval [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5054.74s)]
*  He still does on his own to prove a point. I'm not saying you shouldn't bring up [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5059.3s)]
*  the [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5064.98s)]
*  Nationality of this okay, that is definitely an important point to bring up [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5066.4s)]
*  But you shouldn't only focus on that spontaneously [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5072.799999999999s)]
*  Offering credit to why these campaigns must happen [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5076.5599999999995s)]
*  By taking trump's framing and running with it [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5081.12s)]
*  the framing that even [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5084.96s)]
*  Our intelligence communities did not agree with in their initial assessments, but of course [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5087.44s)]
*  Hakeem jeffries is saying this because he is also bought and paid for by apac democrats have [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5094.24s)]
*  a unique opportunity to present themselves as anti-war for ones they have a unique opportunity to also [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5100.88s)]
*  Take away some of the people in trump's base that are maybe in the margins that thought [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5109.28s)]
*  That they were voting for an anti-war candidate that clearly is not invested in anti-war at all [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5115.84s)]
*  But instead of taking advantage of this opportunity even with a cold calculated cynical approach [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5121.36s)]
*  They can't let go of their other ambition, which is to one defend israel's interests at all costs [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5127.04s)]
*  and two [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5132.72s)]
*  Uh at the behest of defending israel's interests at all costs bomb iran [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5133.92s)]
*  So the american people through their elected representatives would have the opportunity to debate the issue [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5138.32s)]
*  And make some decisions [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5145.76s)]
*  As it relates to what's in? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5148.32s)]
*  The best interest and the national security of the american people donald trump and the administration chose to ignore [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5150.5599999999995s)]
*  the constitution [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5157.44s)]
*  And so they're going to have to come before congress and explain their justification for an offensive military strike [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5159.679999999999s)]
*  against iran [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5168.0s)]
*  It is mind-boggling how bad [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5170.08s)]
*  This response is because it's such a gimme [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5172.639999999999s)]
*  This is as big as a gimme as being like I want to ceasefire in gaza [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5176.16s)]
*  just saying those words [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5180.96s)]
*  and i'm willing to stop israel from getting weapons to to [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5183.5199999999995s)]
*  To get this ceasefire in gaza and the democrats couldn't be bothered to make that simple statement [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5187.36s)]
*  And they lost the elect [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5194.16s)]
*  I cannot understand [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5202.639999999999s)]
*  The u.s. Attitude how insane they are and I also especially do not understand [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5204.8s)]
*  Why so many democrats like visible democrats on twitter? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5210.4800000000005s)]
*  Democratic party supporters rather are going along with this like false narrative [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5214.320000000001s)]
*  They're fantasizing about like kamala harris being a great peacekeeper somehow [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5218.72s)]
*  It is obvious to me that democrats do not want to be anti-war at a time when there is tremendous resentment against war [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5222.4800000000005s)]
*  Even by trump's own base a good article about this because they're talking about [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5229.280000000001s)]
*  Making a comparison to reagan's invasion of granada well before you were born [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5233.200000000001s)]
*  Reagan's invasion of granada and it was it was it was not sanctioned. It was quick [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5238.8s)]
*  very very few casualties if any [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5245.360000000001s)]
*  And didn't cost much [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5249.280000000001s)]
*  This will cost a tremendous amount of money and are we thinking that congress is actually going to [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5251.200000000001s)]
*  Engage in an appropriation to make this happen [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5257.6s)]
*  I think you bring up such an important point that I just want to add to real quickly which is democrats right now [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5259.52s)]
*  Can literally put aside what they feel about iran and whether iran and no one is here justifying or defending iran's actions [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5264.240000000001s)]
*  But they can at least stand up for the rule of law in this country and say the president cannot start a war [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5271.360000000001s)]
*  Without the approval of congress and and laser focus the conversation on saying do not start a war [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5276.88s)]
*  Without the approval of congress and yet they've they seem to have completely [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5282.64s)]
*  Abandoned that principle and say well he should have congress has abandoned that principle for decades [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5288.219999999999s)]
*  But we're talking about the politics of what the democratic leadership should be doing instead of americans looking at tucker carlson [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5294.08s)]
*  Steering ted cruz or steve bannon and saying wow i can't believe these are the people who are saying hey [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AC6r6IFaOw&t=5300.48s)]
