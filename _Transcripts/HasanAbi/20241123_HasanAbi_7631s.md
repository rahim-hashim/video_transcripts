# Gacha Drama And The Korean Gender Issue | Hasanabi Reacts to Moon Channel
**HasanAbi:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY)
*  Before we wrap up our got to drama story. Let's finally talk about what life is like in modern South Korea [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's thank you. Oh my god, but no [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6.92s)]
*  No, he's back to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=10.56s)]
*  No [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Dude this guy bro [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=15.36s)]
*  Stop. He said let's talk about modern Korea and went back to neoconfusionism [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=18.6s)]
*  Let's do that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=30.0s)]
*  It's in the midst of a very bitter civil war one that you might not even realize exists and no [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm not talking about the conflict with North Korea real life lores offices down the hall to the right [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=39.08s)]
*  The civil war I am referring to is the South Korean gender war a conflict between [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=45.08s)]
*  Korean men whom the women in this conflict might call male chauvinist or misogynists and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Korean women whom the men in this conflict might call [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=55.36s)]
*  Now Mooney I can hear you say we have gender war in my country too [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  Why the feminists and the chauvinists are constantly going at it on the internet [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=62.08s)]
*  South Korea is different the gender war there has escalated to the point of physical violence [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=65.96s)]
*  Terroristic behavior and even is this real or is it anti-korean propaganda? No, I think this is real dude at least like [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=72.36s)]
*  Listen all I'm gonna say is this you wouldn't have a movement like the 4b movement, which is like [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  a bunch of women saying like we're not even interacting with men at all if this was not a very [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  Glaringly obvious very real and like uniquely bad problem [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=91.76s)]
*  Cuz like a lot of Americans after the Donald Trump election victory [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=97.28s)]
*  Went on tik-tok and we're like, oh, let's do our own version of the 4b movement and I don't think it'll stick [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=103.12s)]
*  Partially because a shit ton of women in America are also obviously very misogynistic [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=110.16s)]
*  There is a racial dynamic at play here as well [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=115.72s)]
*  You know 55% of white women still voted for Donald Trump [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  That's something you got to remember [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  And outside of that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=128.68s)]
*  Outside of that, I just think that it's like it's bad but either people are [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=133.8s)]
*  Oblivious to how bad it is like women and men are oblivious to how bad it is or [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  It's nowhere near as bad as it is in South Korea from what I understand like these guys [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=144.2s)]
*  like think of the worst type of person that you know, they're just like and hates women and wants to do like and shit and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=149.32s)]
*  Maybe you don't know a person like that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  But like think about the worst person that you see online, right? The type of person that like hails [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  What's his face is like a hero the the the gentleman or whatever the name was. God damn it [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  The was his supreme gentleman everyone's saying tectone no, I'm talking about Elliot Roger, okay [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=169.28s)]
*  Yeah, Elliot Roger like people that think he's a hero for killing a bunch of people at UCSB [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=178.4s)]
*  I feel like I feel like in Korea. There's like it's more permissible to be that outwardly in cell [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=186.88s)]
*  Even political upheaval [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=195.4s)]
*  Even political upheaval and the tension in Korea don't just say white women. Why are you doing that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=197.88s)]
*  No, I'm saying that like there is a shit ton of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=203.28s)]
*  amongst women in America like the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump also [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=207.0s)]
*  White women make up the majority of women. So, you know [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=212.72s)]
*  Between chauvinists and feminists is so substantial that even the tiniest bump can cause an eruption [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=217.16s)]
*  This is the story of one such an eruption a new front in the war between men and women in Korea started over something almost [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=223.72s)]
*  Unbelievably trivial that thing being gotcha game art in case you don't know gotcha games are oh my god mobile games [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=231.48s)]
*  That oh my god right after the right after the I'm gonna die [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=239.24s)]
*  this coming right after we watched the Sean video about fucking grums and how like [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=243.92s)]
*  American gamers and Western gamers like constantly talk about booba and video games. Oh my fucking lord, dude. Oh god [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=249.76s)]
*  She she save us even though you make so much gotcha. Oh my god. I just realized she is not gonna save us [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=257.0s)]
*  He's making gotcha as a weapon [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=263.58s)]
*  He's making gotcha games as a weapon. Oh my god, dear leader G you have unleashed [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=265.92s)]
*  Such a devastating tool upon [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=272.4s)]
*  Every capitalist nation on this planet. Oh my god [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=275.24s)]
*  But implement a randomized vending machine mechanic or gotcha mechanic [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=279.68s)]
*  So named for the sound a Japanese toy capsule vending machine makes when you turn its crank in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=284.16s)]
*  Gotcha games you pay in-game currency, which can sometimes cost real money and you receive [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=289.8s)]
*  Well something that's something very often being a character or character skin that you can then use in-game [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=295.42s)]
*  The very notion that mobile gotcha games could lead to political upheaval is absurd [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=302.12s)]
*  How does a society as sophisticated and wonderful as Korea's arrive at a point where animated waifus can result in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=307.16s)]
*  Terrorism this conflict has deep winding roots in Korea and we're going to try to approach this topic with a nuanced perspective [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=314.8s)]
*  To do so we'll explore both current events and historical context both his story and hers story in order to understand why little sees [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=322.32s)]
*  Can cause such big trouble stop sending me the BBC semen extraction video, please [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=330.6s)]
*  I'm not gonna watch it. Okay [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=336.24s)]

*  That's brilliant org on Gila they give her the five gifted subs smart when you could be [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=390.82s)]
*  Brilliant our story begins in February of 2023 with a small but rapidly growing indie game studio called project moon [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=397.26s)]
*  No relation if you don't play mobile gotcha games [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=404.58s)]
*  You might know project moon from their games library of ruina a card battler somewhat akin to slay the spire and the bottom [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=407.76s)]
*  Corporation a rogue light that plays like a combination between fallout shelter and dwarf fortress with an SCP foundation like setting and a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=414.18s)]
*  difficulty slider locked to masochistic [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=421.22s)]
*  Project moons earlier games were standouts amongst their competitors for two reasons [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=424.14s)]
*  The first reason was project moons unique art style, which was simple but very sleek and stylized [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=428.72s)]
*  The second reason was the lure project moons games are built around grim but fascinating stories [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=434.58s)]
*  Which together create a project moon universe of sorts [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  And so when project moon announced that it was producing a horror role-playing gotcha game for mobile devices [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=444.18s)]
*  There was a surprising amount of enthusiasm [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=449.58s)]
*  Gotcha games are notorious for being cash cows [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=452.86s)]
*  But usually gotcha games are published by big players in the industry like miHoYo, Psy Games or Nexon [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=455.22s)]
*  Creating a gotcha game that players will actually enjoy and spend money on is quite an endeavor [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=461.38s)]
*  It's literally like creating an MMO not just any team can do it [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  But project moon is not just any team and they did indeed release their gotcha game [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=470.7s)]
*  Limbus company to very positive reception fans of project moon were well over the moon with [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=475.98s)]
*  Limbus company and they promoted it far and wide with whispers of the game's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=482.94s)]
*  Surprising depth and unique art reaching even the dark festering routos of Western gotcha reddit [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=486.94s)]
*  Limbus company exploded in popularity far exceeding the expectations of project moon [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=492.5s)]
*  I would know I fell for the hype myself and tried it back in early 2023 [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=497.72s)]
*  The game is a little bit like darkest dungeon mixed with project moons former game in library of ruina [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  Which I also happened to play I determined back then that the game was neat but too involved for me [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=507.56s)]
*  I just didn't have the time to play [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=513.36s)]
*  Evidently not everyone shared in my sentiments limbus company's player count grew and grew and grew [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=515.52s)]
*  Prior to limbus company's release project moons highest ever player account for a game was in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=522.4599999999999s)]
*  2021 when library of ruina briefly saw a peak player count of roughly 7,000 players [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=528.02s)]
*  by April of 2023 [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=533.54s)]
*  limbus company reported roughly [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=535.66s)]
*  260,000 players and a revenue of 1.8 million dollars within just two months of release as per [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=538.8199999999999s)]
*  TV [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=547.32s)]
*  MMO bite goes on to say that limbus company's launch was only a modest one coming in at [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=548.32s)]
*  15% of what ever soul another gotcha game launched to just three months prior [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  But ever soul was published by cacao games [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  Which is a subsidiary of cacao a South Korean internet giant that reported an annual revenue of five point eighty nine billion dollars in [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=560.72s)]
*  2022 limbus company taking home 15% of whatever soul launched to is an extraordinary achievement for an entity as small as [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=569.88s)]
*  Project moon however this smallness this relative inexperience came at a cost for project moon [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  Their diehard fans the ones that had promoted the miss company everywhere knew the score their expectations were tempered with the knowledge that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=584.84s)]
*  Project moon is a small indie death and that problems with the game would be resolved slower than a larger more [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=592.16s)]
*  Experienced to deaf team might manage the new players though well they were much less understanding [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=598.48s)]
*  gotcha devs are usually from big companies and those deaf teams can gauge the expectations of players more accurately and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  Respond to complaints more quickly than a small inexperienced indie team like project moon can [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  The new players missing the context that the old players had were upset [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=616.6s)]
*  I'm legitimately shocked at how this is going to turn into the gender war, but I guess we needed to understand [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=620.2s)]
*  Like gotcha games and and you know that their expectations [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=626.24s)]
*  How they play a formative role in balance changes were slow [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=630.28s)]

*  Their expectations were tempered with the knowledge that project moon is a small indie death [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=640.0s)]
*  And that problems with the game would be resolved slower than a larger more experienced to deaf team might manage [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=644.6s)]

*  Project moon you see has an unstated anti-lewd stance their characters can be attractively designed sure [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=657.24s)]
*  But they make it a point to avoid egregious fan service meaning sexualization and so when project moon announced boo [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  No fan service boo woke woke got him, dude. The player crashes and reloads that in a few frames. I think [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=671.36s)]
*  That limbus company would be adding to swimsuit characters for the summer season [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=677.56s)]
*  The older players weren't expecting anything lewd, but the new players the overwhelming majority of players were expecting [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=680.5999999999999s)]
*  What every gotcha offers for summer swimsuit characters fan service lots and lots of highly provocative prurient fan service [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=686.04s)]
*  One of the two summer characters was a male character named summer Sinclair [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=692.76s)]
*  He wore swim trunks a collar and not much else whereas the female character released was summer Isha [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=696.8399999999999s)]
*  And she wore a skin tight diving wetsuit ish males usual outfit is a suit and tie and so the wetsuit is quite fan [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=702.12s)]
*  Service II the skin tight nature of a wetsuit to the focus on the characters body [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=708.2s)]
*  It's all heavily sexualized and this is for a company which has a history of avoiding such sexualization [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=711.4s)]
*  But this wetsuit was not revealing enough for the new players who were expecting the usual what happened next shook the entire korea [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=716.44s)]

*  It started small just some grumblings on various korean forums by disgruntled players [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=735.88s)]
*  But these grumblings like a tiny snowball at the top of the snow-covered mountain rolled along collecting additional grievances as they went [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=740.12s)]

*  On august 5th korean air flight 801 took off from seoul en route to guam [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=846.5200000000001s)]
*  The aircraft a boeing 747-300 was in good working order [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=851.48s)]

*  The journey across the pacific ocean progressed without any apparent issue as the flight approached guam [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=879.64s)]
*  However, it encountered a storm which obscured the plane's final destination antonio b. Juan pat international airport from sight [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=884.2s)]
*  In aviation lingo these weather-related problems are called imcs instrument meteorological conditions conditions in which one has to fly by flight instruments [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=891.16s)]
*  Instead of utilizing sight you may be familiar with the incident that follows perhaps [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=898.92s)]
*  You've already read a version of this story in malcolm gladwell's book outliers. Think anyone else's words to you [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=903.0s)]
*  Let's read the pilot's words together into a play-by-play [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=907.48s)]
*  This is the intra cockpit communication transcript taken from appendix b of the national transportation safety board's aircraft accident report [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=910.68s)]
*  At 1521 utc the first officer notifies the captain that the condition at guam is no good [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=916.84s)]
*  The captain acknowledges this by stating that it rains a lot as the descent continues the first officer asks the captain [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=922.04s)]
*  Don't you think it rains more in this area here? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=928.04s)]
*  The captain doesn't respond to the questions. He makes further statements and the first officer answers simply yes [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=930.4399999999999s)]
*  At 1526 just five minutes later the flight engineer notices that something is wrong. He asks about guam's condition [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=935.96s)]
*  At 1527 the flight engineer then states that the weather radar has helped us a lot to which the pilot responds [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=942.36s)]
*  Yes, they are very useful at 1529 the captain states [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=947.5600000000001s)]
*  We should be getting onto the route to which the flight engineer responds. It is rising instead [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=951.4000000000001s)]
*  The captain answers in the affirmative. Yeah, you are right [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=956.2s)]
*  10 minutes later the first officer discovers that their incoming runway's glide slope instrument landing system appears unresponsive [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=958.9200000000001s)]
*  He beers to make a statement about it, which is then corroborated by the flight engineer who asks aloud about 30 seconds later [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=965.0s)]
*  Is the glide slope working glide slope? Yeah, the captain replies. Yes. Yes, it's working [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=970.4399999999999s)]
*  The flight engineer can only utter in response a baffled. Ah [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=975.7199999999999s)]
*  so [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=978.76s)]
*  Another voice interrupts, but it's unclear who it is. We can presume it was the captain he asks [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=979.64s)]
*  This video has nothing to do with gender wars lamount. No, I think it's going to tie itself to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=984.4399999999999s)]
*  this is uh, you know remnants of of [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=989.8s)]
*  Sexism and misogyny and how quickly people can fucking whip up a hate campaign surrounding like not having their needs [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=993.3s)]
*  Met that not having their misogynistic needs met [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=999.96s)]
*  this is a story about uh korean culture [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1002.52s)]
*  and uh not speaking back to your um [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1006.12s)]
*  like not speaking back as a subordinate and then [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1010.0400000000001s)]
*  This will then yeah. Oh see. Yeah korea is a hierarchical confucian society confucian society [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1013.1600000000001s)]
*  And then he is yeah [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1019.72s)]
*  He's just he's just giving you certain key aspects of korean culture and how they arrived at this situation [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1020.84s)]
*  If the glide slope is working to which the first officer replies not usable [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1027.72s)]
*  Finally the captain acknowledges that since today's glide slope condition is not good. We need to maintain a 1440 [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1031.72s)]
*  Please set it an unknown voice. Presumably the first officer replies with a simple [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1037.4s)]
*  Yes, the flight engineer jokes that the guy working here probably was a gi in korea before remember this line for later [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1041.4s)]
*  The captain responds a simple affirmation the crew then goes through their landing checks [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1047.56s)]
*  But about one minute later the captain asks again isn't glide slope working and then notes [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1051.8799999999999s)]
*  wiper on [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1056.84s)]
*  Nobody responds to his query this time the flight engineer merely replies. Yes wipers on [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1057.96s)]
*  Not even a minute later the first officer asks not in sight the captain replies [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1063.48s)]
*  Oh, yes, the first officer then states let's make a missed approach the flight engineer confirms not in sight [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1067.56s)]
*  The first officer reciprocates the statement not in sight missed approach the flight engineer says go around the captain says go around [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1073.16s)]
*  And then there's silence save for the ground proximity warning system calling out numbers [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1080.76s)]
*  50 40 [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  30 [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1088.44s)]
*  20 at 142 guam local time korean air 801 slams into the side of nimitz hill just three and a half miles away from the airport [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1089.4s)]
*  Of the 254 people aboard 229 perish [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1097.72s)]
*  Let me ask you something about what we just read does that conversation seem fitting for an imminent plane crash? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1102.1200000000001s)]
*  Why doesn't the first officer take more direct action? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1107.32s)]
*  Why doesn't anyone tell air traffic control what is going on? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1109.56s)]
*  How is it possible that the first officer and flight engineer can directly see what is happening and yet apparently fail to even utter [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1112.28s)]
*  A protest as the captain charges the plane directly into a hillside [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1117.9599999999998s)]
*  The words in the transcript are translated into plain english [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1122.04s)]
*  But there is an additional layer of context required to understand how this plane crash happened and that is cultural context [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1124.52s)]
*  Korean culture is extremely hierarchical more so than china more so than even japan when the first officer asks the captain [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1131.1599999999999s)]
*  Don't you think it rains more in this area here? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1137.64s)]
*  He is trying to respectfully communicate to his superior an elder in age with more flight hours, bro [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1139.96s)]
*  That's i'm not gonna die over manners. Yeah, that is pretty fucking wild [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1145.48s)]
*  I stopped watching for two minutes is the video still about misogyny. It's just giving you [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1149.56s)]
*  Oh my god chatters are so tick tock brain bro. Let this fucking guy cook dude [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1154.1200000000001s)]
*  He's literally he's he's he's teaching you some aspects of fucking korean culture first and foremost, okay? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1159.8s)]
*  He's contextualizing how korea became so fucking misogynistic [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1166.92s)]
*  That the area therein has more rain and that they should try to avoid it [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1170.68s)]
*  When the flight engineer chimes in later stating that the weather radar has helped us a lot [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1174.36s)]
*  This flight engineer is also trying to relay a suggestion to change course and avoid the weather conditions [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1177.8799999999999s)]
*  When the first officer and flight engineer discover the glide slope isn't operational the first officer mutters something about it [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1183.08s)]
*  And the flight engineer asks the captain if the glide slope is working [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1188.68s)]
*  This is a suggestion to the captain that the glide slope is in fact not working and that he should check it [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1191.6399999999999s)]
*  But the captain responds that it is working [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1196.28s)]
*  Which is his statement to the flight engineer that the flight engineer needs to keep to his role and have some respect [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1198.36s)]
*  The flight engineer replies with a baffled. Eh, so [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1204.2s)]
*  Knowing that the captain has realized his disrespect has issued a condemnation and has declined to check the glide slope instrument [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1207.24s)]
*  As a measured response to insubordination the captain satisfied with the behavior of the first officer and flight engineer finally checks the glide slope instrument [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1214.04s)]

*  This communicates that the decision to work around the glide slope is his decision [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1225.72s)]
*  The flight engineer then makes a joke the guy working here probably was a gi in korea before a grunt [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1229.3200000000002s)]

*  The flight engineer says go around and the captain finally cracking acknowledges that he will indeed go around [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1267.8s)]
*  But it is too late. There is no panic. There are no further words spoken [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1273.96s)]

*  Determined that the probable cause of the korean air flight 801 accident was the captain's failure to adequately brief and execute the non-precision approach [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1293.48s)]
*  And the first officers and flight engineers failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain's execution of approach [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1300.1200000000001s)]

*  Hierarchical society more so than in japan more so than in china one's age status family and gender determine one's role in society [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1312.34s)]
*  Although korea offers the appearance of a politically progressive modernized country underneath the veneer of glitz and glam beneath the inesfree toner [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1320.28s)]
*  There exists a deeply conservative society. You might be familiar with the japanese system of honorifics in japan [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1327.1599999999999s)]
*  The more neutral honorific san is commonly used to address a hierarchical equal or an individual whom you are not yet familiar with akin to [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1332.76s)]
*  Mr [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1338.6s)]

*  A teacher addressing a student for example is a social dynamic in which one sometimes might not use an honorific [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1358.8400000000001s)]
*  In your own group of close friends or towards your immediate family [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1363.72s)]
*  You might also be liked not to use honorifics as it feels natural to do so amongst the people you're most comfortable with [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1366.28s)]
*  But it is not this way in korea in south korea the use of honorifics even in informal situations is quite normal [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1370.92s)]
*  If you spend any this type of incidence is happening many times in korean pilots involved is actually pretty crazy [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1376.44s)]
*  The government came in and gave special training to the pilots to ensure this type of power conflict doesn't happen anymore [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1380.92s)]
*  The type of exchange here also occurs between korean pilots and non-korean pilots that cause miscommunication in those plane crashes [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1385.48s)]
*  What the fuck the amount of time living in korea and getting to know korean people [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1390.52s)]
*  Inevitably you will be asked how old you are as your age is critically important in determining the deference [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1394.34s)]
*  You are expected to provide to other people and the deference you receive even amongst your friends [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1399.0s)]
*  You might not even use a person's first name out of deference in a friend group [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1403.72s)]

*  You might have noticed that it's very hard to get them to break the habit of hyunging and opying [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1416.68s)]
*  The expectations of hierarchy in korea are very strict even by east asian standards [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1420.92s)]
*  Why is that how did this happen and what does any of this have to do with gender wars in gacha games? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1425.96s)]

*  Self-respecting korean man would make something this subservient to the interests of feminists, especially not an artist who works on gacha art, right? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1454.8200000000002s)]
*  As such this artist must be a woman and unlike other gacha artist women who happily draw what they are told to draw or better [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1461.8000000000002s)]

*  Like they they have decided that the real villains are actually women part of that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1828.84s)]
*  I think the contributing factor to that probably is also the military draft that is um a direct [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1833.32s)]

*  and uh the goal there is to at least fix some of the underlying material problems so that it's easier to [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1899.8s)]
*  You know change society dramatically in a way that in a way that ensures [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1907.6399999999999s)]

*  As confucianism crept into korean politics and culture vis-a-vis china starting as early as 372 ad with the founding [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  Of the confucian tehok school in the kingdom of gogoryo and continuing through the unified silla period in the year [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2006.1999999999998s)]

*  Confucian schools like these became the preeminent places of learning in korea and confucianism established itself as a dominant philosophy to buddhism [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2015.3200000000002s)]
*  The influence of buddhism in korea reached its apex during the goryo dynasty [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2023.16s)]
*  Not to be confused on youtube streaming is over later goryo kings such as king sun jong seeing confucianism's centralizing power [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2026.44s)]
*  Suppressed the practice of buddhism in favor of confucianism [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2033.3200000000002s)]
*  This trend then exploded during the joseon dynasty where confucianism was elevated to the official ideology of the state [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2036.44s)]
*  But the confucianism of the joseon dynasty adopted was of a very specific school known as neo confucianism [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2041.8799999999999s)]
*  Now neo confucianism developed in i'm gonna think you were talking about it with a bit too much confidence [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2047.6399999999999s)]
*  Like you know 100 what you're talking about. I mean, yes, some of the things i'm talking about are are [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2051.56s)]
*  You know universal like and I do know a little bit about korean history [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2057.16s)]
*  It's not like I said, I didn't know anything about korea. What the fuck [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2060.84s)]
*  I'm just adding some feedback of what I do know, which i'm sure he will address in a second [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2064.52s)]
*  Anyway, god what is wrong with you guys man? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2068.44s)]
*  Which had also become the dominant ideology in tang china just as it was in korea and japan [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2072.52s)]
*  This is going to be an extreme simplification, but where buddhism teaches self-cultivation for the individual purpose of enlightenment [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2077.56s)]
*  neo-confucianism purports that self-cultivation should not merely be a means to individual enlightenment [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2083.54s)]
*  But also a mechanic by which one can contribute to a harmonious society. It's not just you. It's not just me [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2088.76s)]
*  It's us and we must achieve harmony together now neo-confucianism had a lot of benefits for china and korea [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2094.04s)]
*  It was a more rational ideology than buddhism and its focus on the practical matter of statesmanship as opposed to personal spiritual enlightenment [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2100.1200000000003s)]
*  Led to the establishment of more schools of learning as opposed to temples of worship and the uplifting of ethics as a guiding principle [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2107.1600000000003s)]
*  Of family and government but neo-confucianism was not without its strawbacks and issues in the underlying philosophy of neo-confucianism [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2113.7200000000003s)]
*  Led to subsequent reformist thinkers such as yang mingzi who developed for example the philosophical principle of i think therefore i am [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2120.54s)]
*  Over a century prior to renee decart yang mingzi is considered one of the great masters of confucianism in china and japan [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2127.1800000000003s)]
*  It's even been said that yang mingzi's teachings heavily inspired the japanese philosophy of bushido [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2133.5s)]
*  But these reforms never really made it to korea and yang mingzi does not hold the same prestige in korea as he does in china [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2138.06s)]
*  Or japan why well it's because the korean state threw itself wholeheartedly into neo-confucianism [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2143.26s)]
*  So much so that it developed its own independent schools of neo-confucian thought separate from what was emerging in china [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2148.72s)]
*  Where china had yang mingzi korea had yi huang known better perhaps as togye and yi also known as yogo [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2154.8799999999997s)]
*  togye and yang mingzi were contemporaries they lived at the same time period the early 1500s if you watch the video I made on christian games [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2161.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you recall how american calvinists puritans were so deeply entrenched in their beliefs that their calvinism failed to develop as dutch calvinism did [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2168.72s)]
*  How american protestantism branched away from protestantism at large and thus failed to develop neo-calvinist theology as a counterweight to calvinist puritanism [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2175.6s)]
*  Korean neo-confucianism developed very much in that same vein as ming dynasty china evolved its neo-confucianism thereby arguably [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2183.84s)]
*  Softening the strict hierarchical systems that come with neo-confucianism korea doubled down [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2191.18s)]
*  Yeon Sun-li a lecturer at the department of philosophy at seoul national university states in his work yi huang and yi's interpretation of the taiji tu su [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2196.56s)]
*  Focusing on their theories of lee chi quoting the traditional work annals of the joseon dynasty [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  Yi huang took to heart that china lost its tradition of dohac or authentic neo-confucianism [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2208.16s)]
*  In other words yi huang the preeminent korean neo-confucianist scholar utterly rejected chinese developments and ideology in favor of a pure [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2214.08s)]
*  neo-confucianism you may have noticed that I never described what [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2222.3s)]
*  neo-confucianists actually believe outside of their emphasis on hierarchy and I haven't done this because it wouldn't make any sense to you at all [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2224.86s)]
*  It's like trying to read and understand hagel before reading can't but worse by a factor of centuries [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2230.56s)]
*  Let me read you a snippet from the article we just discussed to give you an example [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2235.04s)]
*  Zhu Xi claims that the wuji and the taiji are not separate things [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  He interprets the above phrase as formless, but with lee. Okay. I think there's too much context now, bro [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2240.96s)]
*  I swear to god he's he's he's doing too much context. Okay, this is crazy [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2246.1600000000003s)]
*  And describes it as the substance what is above form skipping ahead [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2251.44s)]
*  Whereas the wuji and the taiji mean the same thing the taiji and the ying yang are to be clearly distinguished [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2255.28s)]
*  In other words, they are explained as belonging respectively to lee and chi. I'll stop there. You get it [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2259.4399999999996s)]
*  I haven't explained neo-confucianism in full because I can't but what I can tell you is that neo-confucianism puts an enormous emphasis on [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2265.2s)]
*  Hierarchy as a stabilizing force of societal harmony. Yi Huang, the korean master we discussed who felt that Ming China had lost true [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2271.74s)]
*  neo-confucianism was himself critiqued by Yi Yi also known as Yulgok. Yi Yi felt that a more physical more material approach to [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2277.98s)]
*  Confucianism was necessary. Self-cultivation knowing oneself one's place one's capacities are directly relevant [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2283.74s)]
*  to proper administration [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2289.4399999999996s)]
*  In other words Yi Yi's teachings deepened the physical bonds between the state and confucianism [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2290.96s)]
*  Not unlike in japan and china a rigid social hierarchy emerged in korea bro went back to the big bang [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2295.68s)]
*  To be like let me explain the context of how we [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  We arrived at the nation state of korea to begin with like that's crazy [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2304.7999999999997s)]
*  He's like you can't you can't address anything until you talk about the theory of evolution like he went [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2309.2s)]
*  He's like let's go back a little bit in time and and a little bit is like literally [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2314.72s)]
*  The year eight, okay. That's not a little bit man [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2319.92s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2324.24s)]
*  No, there is a [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2325.6s)]
*  372 ad [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2327.1s)]
*  A caste system of sorts in which the king sat on top followed by civil leaders and military officers then learned peoples laborers, etc [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2328.4s)]
*  Unlike china and japan, however, this system was more rigid in its execution [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2335.52s)]
*  This formal system was abolished in 1894 [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2340.08s)]
*  But the underlying hierarchical nature of korean society was deeply embedded into the korean psyche and unlike in china or japan [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2342.3199999999997s)]
*  There would be no uprooting of this hierarchical system through a century of conflict with the west [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2349.04s)]
*  China had the opium wars and the self-strengthening movement and the boxer rebellion and much more which did a lot to reduce the influence [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2353.68s)]
*  Of confucianism over china and much of that on the chinese side was intentional attempts to westernize [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2358.56s)]
*  Likewise in japan, you had yeah, he said the wetsuit isn't really compatible with my view of lee's neo-confucianism [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, this is leftist memes be like let me take you to a time back when [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2368.98s)]
*  Commodore perry the bohshin war the meiji restoration, etc [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2373.22s)]
*  Which eroded the influence of confucianism in japan, but you will note of course that confucianism was never eradicated strict adherence to confucian hierarchy [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2375.86s)]
*  And customs remains in both china and japan to this day [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2383.2999999999997s)]
*  One of these countries is literally communist and yet still has confucian hierarchical values built into its society [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2386.66s)]
*  Korea is both the most historically confucian state while also having had the least erosion of that confucianism through external or internal intervention [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2392.4199999999996s)]
*  And it was japan and not a western power that interfered most in korea's modern cultural development [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2399.8599999999997s)]
*  Although korea itself was arguably forced out of its isolationism by surprise surprise the united states [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2405.54s)]
*  Let me explain the koreans called shin miangyo the western disturbance during the shimi year in [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2411.46s)]
*  1866 an american merchant ship called the ss general sherman steamed up the taedong river and attempted to illegally force the koreans to trade [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2417.78s)]
*  After some miscommunication and ignored demands the koreans dispatched a naval contingent to destroy the american sh- [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2425.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2431.0600000000004s)]
*  westerners did that a whole lot [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2431.86s)]
*  Including the other example that he was giving about japan ship and executed the sailors aboard in a punitive mission [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2433.7000000000003s)]
*  As the koreans thought that the american ship was actually a french ship look [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2438.9s)]
*  It's a long story the naval contingent was like something out of age of empires two nine fire ships and a turtle ship [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2442.66s)]
*  This fleet successfully brought down the ss general sherman and the sailors were captured by civilians on the shore and executed [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2448.58s)]
*  A few years later in 1871 the americans dispatched a small fleet to investigate the missing ss general sherman [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2454.2599999999998s)]
*  The koreans had a strict law at the time that no foreign ships could sail up the han river [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2460.5s)]
*  The americans requested access to the han river to ostensibly investigate the general sherman and when the koreans said no [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2464.3399999999997s)]
*  The americans peacefully and cooperatively turned around and left [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2469.62s)]
*  No, just kidding. Of course the americans ignored the order and steamed up the han river [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2473.2999999999997s)]
*  The koreans opened fire but didn't do much damage perhaps intentionally [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2477.3799999999997s)]
*  So the u.s then demanded an apology for violating korea's sovereignty as is tradition [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2480.5s)]
*  The united states gave the koreans 10 days to apologize and when they didn't because why would they the americans opened fire and moved [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2484.8999999999996s)]
*  To capture the fortress of guanxiang garrison after a substantial naval bombardment the americans deposited roughly [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2490.1s)]
*  650 sailors and marines who marched on the fortress capturing it [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2495.8399999999997s)]
*  The americans fielded the remington rolling block carbine the koreans fought back with primitive matchlocks [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2498.98s)]
*  At the end of the conflict the americans had suffered three killed and 10 wounded and had killed [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2504.3399999999997s)]
*  243 people by the american estimate and around also fucking classic [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2508.24s)]
*  350 people by the korean estimate the americans then attempted to persuade the koreans to negotiate again for trade which they naturally declined [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2512.3999999999996s)]
*  As korean reinforcements began to arrive the u.s fleet realizing it was outgunned left for china on july 3rd [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2519.3799999999997s)]
*  But the brazen american attack had inspired a nearby rising power a power that was trying to copy western tactics and technology and ideology [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2524.74s)]
*  As much as it possibly could that power being japan japan inspired by the american attack and remembering how their own [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2531.54s)]

*  Six in order to purposefully provoke a korean response before then issuing a blockade of the region with their navy and demanding an unequal trade [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2557.54s)]
*  Treaty under these familiar terms ones that they learned from their own encounter with the united states [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2563.86s)]
*  Give us what we want or be subject to incredible violence [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2568.58s)]
*  And the koreans complied signing the first of many unequal treaties with japan [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2571.86s)]
*  This unequal treaty paved the way for other nations to force trade upon korea and before long just like in china [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2576.1s)]
*  Just like in japan modern direct conflict with traditional confucian systems of government [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2580.74s)]
*  But unlike in china or japan that process was cut fatally short [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2584.8999999999996s)]
*  Tensions were rising between china and japan and the consequences of massive trade inflow through unequal treaties in korea had led to political [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2589.14s)]
*  Turmoil and famine in korea proper the conflict between neo confucians and the uncontrolled influx of western values and technology [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2595.22s)]
*  Was also reaching a fever pitch which erupted into the donghak peasant revolution donghak means eastern learning [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2601.7799999999997s)]

*  The last king of the joseon dynasty requested aid from china to suppress the rebellion [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2613.3s)]
*  The japanese fearing that they would lose influence sent their own soldiers without korea's consent as the rebellion came to an end korea demanded [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2617.62s)]
*  The immediate departure of japanese soldiers which the japanese refused in july of 1894 japan made its move occupying the royal palace in seoul [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2624.26s)]
*  And taking king gojong prisoner before july had even ended the japanese had replaced members of the korean government with pro-japanese [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2631.62s)]
*  puppets the sino-japanese war was about to begin and the russo-japanese war loomed over the horizon [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2637.22s)]
*  But the annexation of korea by imperial japan was already underway. Yeah, imperial japan is is [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2641.8599999999997s)]
*  wild just an [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2648.74s)]
*  unstoppable maddening force of [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2651.12s)]
*  Evil all across the all across the the the far reaches of japanese empire [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2654.02s)]
*  korea did not get to experience a meiji restoration or a self-strengthening movement from beginning to end as it simply didn't have [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2659.8599999999997s)]
*  The time the american attack occurred in 1871 the japanese forcing open korea occurred in 1876 [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2666.1s)]
*  And by 1894 less than 20 years after being forced open for trade korea was already under threat of annexation by japan [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2672.26s)]
*  In the year 1910 japan formalized its annexation of korea with the signing of the japan korea annexation treaty [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2680.26s)]
*  The japanese occupation of korea was brutal the suffering of the korean people [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2687.3s)]
*  Unimaginable the horrors of the occupation are beyond the scope of this video [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2692.96s)]
*  But i'll leave some reading in the description for you if you'd like to learn more [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2696.98s)]
*  One of the most grotesque of japan's inflections upon korea was the systematic eradication of korean culture [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2699.86s)]
*  The japanese banned the korean language replacing it with japanese they attempted to eliminate the use of korean names [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2706.1s)]
*  They tried to change the very fabric of korean history so as to assimilate the korean people more easily [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2711.14s)]
*  But as is evident the japanese did not succeed in eradicating korean culture [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2716.82s)]
*  The japanese attempt at cultural eradication actually caused the koreans to entrench their culture to preserve it by any means [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2720.74s)]
*  Necessary as such korean culture thrives to this very day brighter than ever with each korean generally quite proud of his or her [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2728.64s)]
*  Cultural heritage and eager to share it with the world just as korean culture at large survived japanese annexation [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2735.7s)]
*  However, so too did korean neo-confucianism and although the influence of this neo-confucianism deteriorated very substantially under japanese rule [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2741.3s)]
*  It was never completely quashed for all of their imperialism and westernization the japanese imperial government was deeply hierarchical [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2748.8199999999997s)]
*  With its own legitimacy tied inseparably to bushido. You will recall that neo-confucianist philosophy had a lot of influence on bushido [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2756.1s)]
*  Bushido built upon the foundations of neo-confucianism and imperial japan was built on bushido [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2763.7799999999997s)]
*  As such neo-confucianism and specifically korean puritan neo-confucianism became deeply internalized in korea to a much greater extent than it did in china or japan [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2769.8599999999997s)]
*  Citing here the root ledge handbook on east asian politics south koreans believe their country not only as closer to china than japan [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2778.66s)]
*  But in administrative culture and familism more confucian than china [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2784.98s)]
*  And indeed in post-war korea this strict adherence to hierarchy was utilized in a big way to reign in the people [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2789.8599999999997s)]

*  Rules about hierarchy. That's it. That entire process is basically reduced to what I just explained [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=2822.1800000000003s)]

*  Obviously, it's not like the same level. It's not the same severity [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3029.7s)]
*  but [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3034.2599999999998s)]
*  if society is like routinely [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3035.22s)]
*  If society is like routinely undermining you and you are just experiencing tremendous amounts of oppression and there is seemingly no way out of it [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3038.5s)]
*  Then yeah, you're gonna inevitably be like, okay, i'm just not even being around men [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3046.74s)]
*  That's not entirely true as it doesn't explain zealous martyrdom in the context of which I explain it [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3051.14s)]
*  It does make sense. Okay, you're you're comparing it to like [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3057.22s)]
*  Like a fucking incel doing a school shooting, okay [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3062.1s)]
*  And then killing themselves. That's not what i'm talking about. Not all terrorism is a is a final act [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3065.7s)]
*  coming from a [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3071.78s)]
*  You know moment of desperation and wanting to it's not always going to be [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3073.22s)]
*  Uh, there's not always going to be a shit ton of logic involved in this [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3077.14s)]
*  Okay, most korean women don't know what the 4b movement is is severely blown out of proportion. Most korean women don't even like it [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3080.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't necessarily care about the 4b movement as much. I know that's like the the highlight or the high note [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3086.1800000000003s)]
*  It's the it's the tip of the iceberg that everybody pays attention to [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3092.7400000000002s)]
*  that still doesn't change the the gender war dynamic that very much seemingly exists in korea and is like [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3096.34s)]
*  Born out of the the underlying inequalities [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3103.2200000000003s)]
*  You notice how in three-fourths of the region the women are moving further and further steeply in direction [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3109.46s)]
*  But in south korea look a wide ideology gap is opening up between young men and young women in countries across the world [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3113.06s)]
*  Holy fuck look at the men just [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3119.06s)]
*  straight up [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3121.7799999999997s)]
*  Falling off the cliff dude. Oh my lord [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3123.38s)]
*  like I think [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3126.82s)]
*  The the 4b movement is a is a manifestation of all the anger and resentment that people feel when they when they feel like the systems [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3128.02s)]
*  Have completely cast them aside [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3134.34s)]
*  Understandable considering you have an incel president in south korea [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3136.4s)]
*  Um [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3140.26s)]
*  but uh having said that there is still very much a major problem here [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3141.54s)]
*  And I think the systems are more important to to hyper focus on rather than the way women have decided to fight against it [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3146.7400000000002s)]
*  If that makes it or some women have decided to fight against it [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3154.34s)]
*  Anyway, let's continue important new patch which remastered the game's angelic tailor is beautifully animated and terribly cute [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3157.06s)]
*  But it would soon find itself at the very center of a new crisis [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3162.9s)]
*  The korean gacha men is still on high alert due to the recency of the ishmael wetsuit incident [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3165.7799999999997s)]
*  Discovered a few frames of animation in which angelic buster appeared. How's my favorite anti-semitic doing hating the jewish people today? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3169.86s)]
*  First of all, why the fuck do you have a favorite anti-semitic? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3177.54s)]
*  Cry more red wave i'm worn out from smiling today [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3181.38s)]
*  Bro's a fucking trump supporting right winger and he's over here trying to fucking call me an anti-semite. This is what i'm gonna do to him [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3184.82s)]
*  Okay [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3191.7s)]
*  This I like this. This is cool. Hey, hey chatter. This is you. Okay this right here. This is sick [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3192.66s)]
*  Yeah, go piss your bed to own the lives, dude [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3200.02s)]
*  You're to be making the pinching symbol of megalia the little c [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3202.8199999999997s)]
*  You can see it for one frame in the intro of the animation and once more later as angelic buster is spinning [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3206.1s)]
*  A firestorm erupts and a similar song and dance occurs [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3210.8999999999996s)]
*  This briefly visible pinching motion must be the work of a radical feminist as like they talk about misandry as a serious subject [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3214.18s)]
*  Oh my god, oh my god, they're so cooked bro. Korean media is so cooked. Oh my god [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3220.58s)]
*  People are unironically talking about misandry. Oh my god. Be a man be a man be a man be a man be a man be a man [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3226.98s)]
*  be a man be a man [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3233.2200000000003s)]
*  Only a radical feminist would include this dog whistle this anti-male hate speech slur in an animation [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3238.1s)]
*  All eyes were on the animation studio that created the trailer studio popo rii also known as studio root [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3245.2200000000003s)]
*  And as the chauvinists dug deeper looking into studio popo rii's past animations something became very clear [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3249.86s)]
*  The hand pinch signs were everywhere in korean games ranging from maple story to blue archive from epic 7 to dungeon fighter [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3255.54s)]
*  Where studio popo rii was there too was the pinch the first target that the angry mob lashed out at was [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3262.42s)]
*  Nade the vocalist for the song in the animation [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3267.94s)]
*  She had retweeted old tweets that were in support of kim jae-yong back in 2016 [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3270.74s)]
*  Which was enough to paint her as a misandrist a man hater, but nare didn't draw anything [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3274.8199999999997s)]
*  She was a vocalist not an animator. So someone else put the pinch into the animation, right? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3279.54s)]
*  Well, the next target was a woman named taeso an animator and team leader at studio popo rii [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3283.86s)]
*  She had an old tweet in which she stated that she would never stop being a feminist even though she'd had her social media [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3288.1s)]
*  Accounts blocked for being offensive towards men. She stated further that she will always continue to be a feminist stealthily and subtly [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3293.2999999999997s)]
*  Most damning of all she also liked a tweet that was critical of limbus company's firing of vel mori [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3300.42s)]
*  Nexon and studio property were inundated with angry complaints and as was the case with nexon where women are getting fired for being remotely [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3306.5s)]
*  Pro-feminist that country is cooked. It's crazy. Why are you all right with chat spamming such hurtful resume as korean men [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3314.42s)]
*  You know the context yet. You still encourage it chat is mostly white. It is literally promoting racism false stereotypes [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3321.38s)]
*  Wait, what this right here is not about korean men. I'm calling a fucking right-wing american republican [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3327.86s)]
*  You know using this to make fun of a right-wing american. Yes, the pinching thing is racist. Wait, what? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3335.78s)]
*  No, i'm saying he has a little dick the fuck. Are you talking about why are you why are you getting mad? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3341.38s)]
*  What the fuck? Why is that racist to say someone is a little little ass dick? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3347.78s)]
*  What the fuck am I am I misunderstanding something the issue also is that south korean netizens have started doing these witch hunts against any and all women [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3352.42s)]
*  Who they consider to be feminists gotten to a degree where being called a feminist can result in a woman being fired and even shunned [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3359.78s)]
*  From their communities or workplaces even some women only causes of being threatened to becoming co-ed when they have always been historically women only [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3364.66s)]
*  Oh my god, not defending him, but it's an asian stereotype. Okay [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3371.38s)]
*  Okay, this is crazy. Hey guys guys [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3375.94s)]

*  Korean people's penises. What the fuck? Oh my god chatters got made you made the chat and what chatters got mad [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3383.14s)]

*  Is an anti-feminist conspiracy theory that originated in south korean claims [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3405.38s)]
*  There's a deliberate plot to spread and promote misandry through hand gesture imagery [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3408.5s)]
*  It asserts that radical feminism groups have propagated the hidden message to mock small penises bro is it's got his own wikipedia page [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3412.1s)]

*  Kim chung sup the director of maple story at nexon held a live stream press conference in which he reassured the angry maple story players that [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3625.94s)]
*  We will never allow a culture that publicly expresses hatred towards others and those who enjoy such a culture to defame [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3633.86s)]
*  On november 26th studio pupuri published its own apology in which it appeared to admit fault and offered the angry mob exactly what it wished for [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3641.06s)]
*  Complete and utter capitulation and validation of their claims of foul play the target of the mob's anger [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3648.34s)]

*  But what you make of it is what matters? Okay, like when I talk about divorced dads, there's a shit ton of men who are divorced [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3686.8999999999996s)]

*  Okay, and and numerous other people like kane west exuding divorced dad energy uncle sam on the other hand does not [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3711.2200000000003s)]
*  And the same goes for having a small pp [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3718.5s)]
*  Okay [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3721.1400000000003s)]
*  Same goes for the difference between a manlet and a short king [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3721.86s)]
*  The way it works is that men can say imagine making fun of a woman's body totally lacks broader social analysis [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3725.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but they do make fun of women's bodies. What the fuck after this is about instituting control over what women can and can't do [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3730.82s)]
*  Or can and can't say [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3736.9s)]
*  Including but lot not limited to it's not even fuck what you want to say about women's bodies [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3738.9s)]
*  Which they do all the time. It seems like they won't even let women be like i'm a feminist [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3744.34s)]
*  That's like way worse than even objectifying women or telling women what they can and can't do [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3749.46s)]
*  They're now saying you can't even think that you are equal. What the fuck it's in your dating sim 2. Wait, what? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3754.5s)]
*  Oh my wait, what is this website? Did you just find a [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3765.38s)]
*  Is this an in-cell website? They're saying they're claiming that this is actually secretly. Hey, yo [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3769.0600000000004s)]
*  Hey, yo, this shit is crazy [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3775.6200000000003s)]
*  God damn i'm learning so much looking on further promotional videos [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3779.2200000000003s)]
*  This apology was deemed insufficient though as tasa was not outright fired studio pupuri was accused of a false placation [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3782.98s)]
*  An angry mob allegedly went to their offices taking pictures and spying on their employees [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3789.1400000000003s)]
*  The situation was getting dangerous and studio pupuri could do no more without risking their safety [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3792.9s)]
*  On november 27th studio pupuri issued a second apology and stated that the animator in question taso would not be fired [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3797.3799999999997s)]
*  But would instead resign this apology and the firing was quickly retracted, but it was too late [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3803.14s)]
*  Yeah, the getting canceled for being a feminist is way worse and being objectified. Lola [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3808.66s)]
*  You can look but don't take my rights away. No, i'm just saying like it's one step above that. You know what I mean? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3811.7799999999997s)]
*  like they've moved beyond being like [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3817.54s)]
*  What women can and can't wear? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3820.18s)]
*  Which still comes back to like obviously women being servile and and being considered like less than men [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3822.9s)]
*  But but now they're like you also can't even advocate for your equality [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3828.34s)]
*  Like that's insane [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3832.7400000000002s)]
*  The damage was done. You can imagine what happened next [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3834.82s)]
*  Oh [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3837.86s)]
*  Bro the oh my god, they're blurring it they're blurring it on tv like as in it's it's hate speech. Oh my god [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3859.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh my god chat. This is literally like this is like if if there was like enough [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3866.8199999999997s)]
*  people that were just willing and able to to [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3873.38s)]
*  Go out the bat for flat eartherism and then they they said that like it's ableist if you fucking I don't know [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3877.7799999999997s)]
*  Attack us for believing the earth is flat and then they just like forced their will upon the broader society [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3885.54s)]
*  And then everyone had to just basically like you had to censor the globe you had to start [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3892.02s)]
*  Teaching that the earth was flat like this is the most insane thing i've ever seen. It's crazy [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3896.5s)]
*  Once again, the controversy was so severe that it made korean national news a much more in-depth segment this time [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3912.74s)]
*  On november 30th a week after the angelic buster trailer was released three days after taesoo's resignation an incredibly unsurprising discovery was made [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3918.82s)]
*  After a media investigation it was reported that the animator who drew the controversial angelic buster scenes was a man in his 40s [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3926.98s)]
*  Quoting now a major newspaper kyeon hyang shin moon's article maple index finger storyboard drawn by a man [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3934.26s)]
*  As a result of coverage by the kyeong hyang shin moon on the 30th [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3939.78s)]
*  It was confirmed that the original storyboard for the video in question was handled by mr [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3942.98s)]
*  A a male animator in his 40s from a company other than studio popuri mr [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3946.82s)]
*  A was an additional manpower sought due to the urgent deadline presented by nexon [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3951.6200000000003s)]
*  Basically everyone involved in this animation [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3956.26s)]
*  It turns out was male and industry officials found that it was impossible for a malicious edit to have occurred adding a controversial frame [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3957.7000000000003s)]
*  But that didn't stop the harassment and the kyeong hyang shin moon confirms that mr [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3964.1800000000003s)]
*  A the artist and mr b the male supervisor in his 50s were both harassed over their involvement [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3967.7000000000003s)]
*  But just like with vel mori it didn't matter anymore to the men that taesoo had nothing to do with the finger pinch in the angelic buster trailer [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3973.2200000000003s)]
*  If studio popuri has a feminist working in their midst one who has a stated intention to do feminist things [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3979.3s)]
*  Nothing that they say can be trusted the women staged protests in front of nexon's offices and the men retaliated with threats of violence on social media [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3984.82s)]
*  Studio popuri's employees were harassed endlessly allegedly receiving threats and hate messages and even having their personal information shared online [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3991.38s)]
*  Daesoo herself also had her personal information and phone number leaked to the public by angry men [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=3998.1800000000003s)]
*  She became a bro. This is literally collective schizophrenia. Okay, it's so fucked dude if i'm [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4002.5800000000004s)]
*  Bro, no disrespect to anybody, but if i'm dprk and I hear about this i'll be like nah, dude, we're not fucking [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4009.5400000000004s)]
*  The the demilitarized zone just got fucking [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4016.7400000000002s)]
*  A mile longer. Okay. I'll be like no [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4020.1800000000003s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4023.7000000000003s)]
*  What the fuck there this is crazy victim of cyber bullying in the form of sexual harassment and death [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4025.8599999999997s)]
*  No unification over some retweets and allegations surrounding art [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4031.3799999999997s)]
*  She didn't actually draw once again an innocent woman had been targeted and an entire company had been brought to heel over something painfully [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4034.8999999999996s)]
*  Trivial a few frames of a hand gesture in an animated trailer with no bad intentions behind it [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4041.22s)]
*  But unlike the ishmael swimsuit incident this time the drama broke containment [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4045.7s)]
*  The angry men turned their attention to other games and as many of them came from the gacha game community [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4050.1s)]
*  Their targets were disproportionately gacha games. They began tearing apart every single animated trailer every frame of art searching for the megalia pinch [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4054.1800000000003s)]
*  Dude, this is the problem. Okay, you give these fucking freaks an inch an inch [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4061.1400000000003s)]
*  And they will take a fucking arm. Okay [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4067.3s)]
*  Like that's the issue. You can't let institutions cave and capitulate the fucking freakish monsters [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4071.06s)]
*  Especially when they have not logically arrived [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4077.84s)]
*  at their positions [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4081.1400000000003s)]
*  There is no valid movement here. This is completely fucked. That's it. All you do is is galvanized these people [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4083.2999999999997s)]
*  I feel like i'm going insane watching the the news unfold. Okay, it's like it's like yeah, what do you what do you expect, dude? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4090.8999999999996s)]
*  What do you fucking expect when you normalize this kind of behavior? These people are just gonna be like, oh, yeah [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4097.219999999999s)]
*  We gotta we gotta kill we gotta scalp. They're just gonna keep going after women more because because there is no [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4101.54s)]
*  Real oppression that they're fighting if there was a valid oppression that they were struggling against [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4108.099999999999s)]
*  Once that oppression was tackled [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4113.780000000001s)]
*  Then they would stop that's usually how this works. That's why in the aftermath of the abolition [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4115.9400000000005s)]
*  of slavery [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4122.9800000000005s)]
*  The violence did not come from newly freed black men and women it actually came from the clan [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4124.5s)]
*  Which formed as a way to restore the racial hierarchy historically speaking when the oppressed people [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4131.54s)]
*  Actually overcome their oppression through violent struggle, okay, they don't reinforce [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4139.7s)]
*  a new [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4146.339999999999s)]
*  A new dynamic or a new hierarchy of oppression. They're just like, okay cool. Now we're free like that's it great [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4147.78s)]
*  I love that but on the inverse of this if there is no real oppression and no real struggle [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4155.379999999999s)]
*  And you are simply building a momentum or or movement off of pre-existing [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4161.0599999999995s)]
*  dynamics [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4166.639999999999s)]
*  Okay pre-existing methods of of mechanisms of oppression [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4167.7s)]
*  Like misogyny in a patriarchal society when you give them an inch when institutions bend to their will they're gonna do more [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4171.7s)]
*  Yeah, this is like this is like caving to the qanon freaks and being like [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4179.22s)]
*  Universal studios wanted to apologize. Uh, yes, you are right. Tom hanks is a pedophile. We're very sorry for [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4184.74s)]
*  Putting forward the pedophile tom hanks for being in the movie, you know [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4192.34s)]
*  What do you think that would have if universal studios came out and said that [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4196.66s)]
*  What do you think would happen? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4200.58s)]
*  They'd be like, oh, you know who else a pedophile every single person look at this message board [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4202.18s)]
*  We found even more pedophiles and very naturally they found many such pinches [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4206.34s)]
*  The dev teams of those games were subjected to similar harassment until they too capitulated [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4210.9800000000005s)]
*  Editing or removing any instance of art with a possible finger pinch from the korean bird [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4214.74s)]
*  That's so funny. They're like every time if you have a woman on screen to have to do this god forbid [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4218.42s)]
*  Look at this. This is the way they branded it in korea [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4224.26s)]
*  Did this in league of legends? Yeah, I I saw we already covered it briefly versions of their games making concessions in order to avoid further harassment [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4227.62s)]
*  and violence [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4234.9s)]
*  Some dev teams such as the one at neoez's brown dust 2 even acted preemptively removing any art that could even potentially resemble the megalian sea [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4236.099999999999s)]
*  Before negative attention found them. I know what most of you are thinking. This is insane. This is crazy [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4243.46s)]
*  First these men ride it over a wetsuit and now they're forcing dev team after dev team corporation after corporation to apologize and capitulate [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4248.82s)]
*  Over anything even vaguely resembling an index finger and thumb forming a c a position. No, man. This is not masculinity [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4255.38s)]
*  Being volatile you're wrong. This is 100 [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4263.54s)]
*  Like a completely fucked dystopian society. It's a it's a powder keg. Also the pope strikes again [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4268.1s)]
*  He's doing the pinch and he's hamas. I'm telling you dude. This is this like this only happens if if [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4274.9s)]

*  The volatility of masculinity is incorrect. There's plenty of fucking masculine societies where it doesn't get to this level at all [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4286.82s)]
*  There's plenty of toxic masculine societies [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4292.179999999999s)]
*  America has toxic masculinity [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4294.98s)]
*  America much like most of the world is a patriarchal society [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4297.38s)]
*  This level of this this is mania you have to look to you have to look at like you have to look at the underlying [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4302.12s)]
*  material [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4309.08s)]
*  Issues in which need I remind you is the resting position of the hand and is thereby virtually unavoidable [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4310.360000000001s)]
*  It's easy to look at a situation like this and feel dumbfounded as we will see even other gotcha playing men sharing similar prurient [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4317.56s)]
*  Interests and culturally adjacent countries like china and japan by the extremism of the korean men [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4323.22s)]
*  But in truth the anger being vented the frustrations being expressed towards project moon and val morey and studio poppari and taiso [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4329.48s)]
*  They aren't really about swimsuits or finger pinches or heat symbols [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4336.68s)]
*  Before we wrap up our got a drama story. Let's finally talk about what life is like [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4341.08s)]
*  In modern south korea. That's thank you. Oh my god, but no [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4346.12s)]
*  No, he's back to the fucking no [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4351.64s)]
*  God damn dude [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4355.16s)]
*  This guy bro [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4357.24s)]
*  Stop [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4359.48s)]
*  He said let's talk about modern korea and went back to neo-confusionism [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4361.16s)]
*  Fuck I was like, thank god finally [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4366.599999999999s)]
*  Especially neo-confusionism if society is dysfunctional if society is unharmonious if it is discordant [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4369.639999999999s)]
*  Some part of the system some level of the hierarchy must be responsible for that discord [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4376.44s)]
*  Think back to our korean airlines story from part one if the glide slope instrument is broken [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4381.16s)]
*  It must be a gi on the ground who is responsible in confucian society if disharmony arises [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4386.52s)]
*  Ideally whichever level of the hierarchy is responsible for said disharmony is moved back to the righteous and harmonious course [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4392.2s)]
*  By the level of hierarchy directly above them employees are corrected by their bosses children by their parents [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4398.52s)]
*  So it's confusionism paired up with with uh patriarchy. Is that what it is? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4403.96s)]
*  So like women are inherently the lower rank than men [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4408.44s)]
*  So they're these guys are all just blaming. Uh, the women in the cast is them because women technically are [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4412.28s)]
*  You know underneath them in the caste system. Is that what it is? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4417.639999999999s)]
*  If the higher level fails at doing that the level above them then has the responsibility to take over [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4421.0s)]
*  If each layer continues to fail eventually the emperor steers the entire ship of society in the direction that can bring it back to harmony and order [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4426.12s)]
*  Hopefully integrating any necessary social change in the process but in an extremely neo-confusion [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4433.0s)]
*  State a status quo can emerge which so strongly emphasizes harmony in order that it rejects social change causing society to stay [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4438.839999999999s)]
*  We wanted one question answered, but we're gonna leave with a minor in korean gender studies [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4445.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no ethnic minorities to blame so they target women instead. Yeah, I guess america is so confucianist [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4450.2s)]
*  In the way that they look for [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4456.599999999999s)]
*  A permanent underclass that they can blame stagnate when the top of the hierarchy is especially it is kind of like american-wide [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4458.919999999999s)]
*  Supremacy bureaucratic or incompetent or corrupt or self-serving [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4465.16s)]
*  Disorder gets enveloped by obfuscation and the underlying problems never get fixed [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4468.12s)]
*  The problem becomes enveloped mired in nonsense and misinformation and moving goal posts and bureaucracy [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4473.0s)]
*  At the end of all the fighting and mess social harmony is pulled back into its place without the requisite social change [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4479.0s)]
*  Such that the underlying issues do not get solved [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4485.24s)]
*  This behavior goes down the ladder from the top the top of the hierarchy does this to the middle and the middle does this to [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4487.96s)]
*  We clearly need to import more america soldiers take the pressure off korean women brother. I'm not lying to you when I say this [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4493.0s)]
*  That is how they got here. Okay, that's what I think that's what made the [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4499.400000000001s)]
*  The the situation is so volatile to begin with [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4505.56s)]
*  Okay [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4509.240000000001s)]
*  That's a part of the problem. I think [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4510.120000000001s)]
*  Each following crazy is part of this is that despite all this sucker at a female president before america in the lead of the other in [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4512.68s)]
*  The confucian manner these issues don't go away though. They're still enjoying the video about more context about neo-confucianism [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4518.28s)]
*  Bro, bro had to bring it back, dude [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4525.639999999999s)]
*  He had to bring it back to neo-confucianism [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4528.44s)]
*  We gotta talk about the hann river. I'll have you recall in my former video where the american boats were riding up the hann river [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4531.48s)]
*  fuck [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4539.0s)]
*  There they merely build intention if each time a conflict arises it is suppressed again without resolution [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4540.679999999999s)]
*  The tension and subsequent conflict grows larger and larger and larger [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4547.24s)]
*  Until it eventually breaks out of the control of the state of the society entirely of the top of the hierarchy and into open civil [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4551.08s)]

*  I always go back to that one famous japanese yale economist who was like I have a solution to japan's aging like to japan's capitalism crisis [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4835.4s)]
*  Let's kill every old person that is unironically what he said [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4843.56s)]
*  And you want to know what's really crazy about that? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4848.2s)]
*  Japanese youth heard that and was like that's an incredible idea [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4851.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4856.52s)]
*  They literally were like oh my god [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4857.56s)]
*  Finally someone came up with a fantastic solution [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4860.42s)]
*  that [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4863.88s)]
*  Is fucking insane. Okay, that's insane [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4865.08s)]
*  That had to be hyperbole no, no, no, no, that's not hyperbole at all. I'm not even remotely exaggerating. There is a famous [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4869.64s)]
*  japanese [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4878.12s)]
*  economist [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4879.48s)]
*  I think or he was a sociologist. I'm not entirely sure what it was but [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4880.68s)]
*  Oh, here it is with the fucking cool-ass glasses a yale professor suggested mass suicide for all people in japan [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4884.5199999999995s)]
*  What did he mean? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4890.12s)]
*  Yusuke narita says he's mainly addressing a growing effort to revamp japan's age-based hierarchies still [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4891.48s)]
*  He has pushed the country's hottest button [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4897.08s)]
*  Yeah, but no, you don't understand the craziest part isn't that he suggested this okay like or he had the audacity [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4899.08s)]
*  To dream. Okay [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4907.72s)]
*  The craziest part is people heard it and were like that's a banger idea [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4909.4800000000005s)]
*  But he wasn't joking. He wasn't memeing. He was just straight up like, you know [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4915.0s)]
*  Let's just kill some of these old motherfuckers like and and the japanese youth heard that and said we hear you [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4918.2s)]
*  That sounds like a great idea [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4924.68s)]
*  They proposed another recently. Oh, I saw this one ban on women marrying after 25 this bizarre proposal to boost the birth rate in japan [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4926.76s)]
*  Japan's noted writer and conservative party leader naoki hyakuta [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4934.360000000001s)]

*  He said that to boost the nation's birth rate women should be banned from marriage after the age of 25 and from removing [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4943.56s)]
*  And from removing their uterus post the age of 30. I swear to god, dude. Listen listen [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4948.92s)]
*  Mark fisher cooked [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4955.24s)]

*  we can [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4959.0s)]
*  We can imagine the end of the world before we imagine the end of capitalism [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4960.28s)]
*  It is easier to imagine the end of the world [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4965.56s)]
*  Than it is to imagine the end of capitalism [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4969.8s)]
*  Okay, these people are just like staring down the barrel of a gun and going fuck it dude. I got no other options [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4973.24s)]
*  Let's just kill old people or they're looking at the situation and going let's just you know [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4980.12s)]
*  forcibly [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4985.14s)]
*  Impregnate every woman under the age of 35 or under the age of 30. That's fucking insane [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4986.2s)]
*  Yeah, he did. He just straight up said [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4993.0s)]
*  Yeah, he did he said women have their uterus removed after the age of 30 not allowed to go to school after 18 unable to marry after [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=4998.28s)]
*  25 [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5004.5s)]
*  Fuck it. Just kill him after 40 if they haven't given birth [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5005.64s)]
*  Like what are we doing? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5009.96s)]
*  Okay, we've moved so far beyond the the problems [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5012.28s)]
*  Facing our minimum is these different societies hyper competitive and one who is lower on the hierarchy [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5017.32s)]
*  Which in confucianism should be most people have to overcome both that competition and the enormous advantages of the privileged people in korean society [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5022.6s)]
*  To get anywhere or be anyone if you watch the jrpg video [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5029.88s)]
*  You might recall that japan's economy is controlled in large part by megan conlomorets with enormous political power called the keiretsu [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5033.4800000000005s)]
*  In south korea the situation is even more severe the chaebols are very much like the keiretsu [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5039.16s)]
*  They are thick webs of interwoven business relationships, but even more exclusive. Yeah, this is why I say south korea is like fucking [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5043.8s)]
*  well, it's one company that owns everything but it's like [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5050.4400000000005s)]
*  Six families that the chaebol chaebols own basically every aspect of the economy and [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5054.52s)]
*  And it is is so fucking cooked. Oh my god [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5061.64s)]
*  They're they're fucking they're living in a in a techno feudalist dystopia already [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5065.48s)]
*  As many of them are families built quite literally in the confucian style [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5070.12s)]
*  The top 10 chaebols in south korea account for nearly 60 percent of the country's gdp [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5073.4s)]
*  Another nearly 25 percent is accounted for by the remaining 50 some odd chaebols altogether 80 to 85 percent of south korea's gdp is controlled by about [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5077.96s)]
*  64 families to give you an idea how [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5086.68s)]
*  Preposterous these numbers are when the united states broke up standard oil, you know rockefeller the octopus [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5089.879999999999s)]
*  Well standard oil accounted for only 1.7 percent of the u.s gdp at the time of its breakup in 2022 [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5095.4s)]
*  Samsung's revenue by itself was a little over 20 percent of south korea's gdp [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5102.5199999999995s)]
*  The margin of error in the estimate is larger than standard oil's entire percentage [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5107.639999999999s)]
*  And in spite of the vast wealth here the money is not trickling down for most young people [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5112.2s)]
*  There is simply not enough opportunity to go around and the best that one can look forward to is to work at a chaebol [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5117.08s)]
*  Perhaps and be treated like a wage slave. The system is untenable and unsustainable [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5122.52s)]
*  You have to have the best grades the most handsome or beautiful appearance the most socially corrected demeanor in order to compete for an ever [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5126.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I forgot about this. Okay, so [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5132.68s)]
*  Remember what I talked about the aesthetic [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5135.16s)]
*  That is in korean society [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5138.28s)]
*  Earlier I check and correct me on this if i'm [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5140.28s)]

*  Beauty standards and whatnot and how fucking crazy it is [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5174.52s)]
*  Someone could correct me on this if i'm wrong [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5177.72s)]
*  We need a historical context dude. I will fucking I will melt you [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5180.36s)]
*  Okay, I will send you I will send you into orbit if you ask me about confucianism one more fucking time [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5183.96s)]
*  Okay, we're not going to do 45 extra minutes on neo confucianism in south korea [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5188.76s)]
*  Someone could correct me if i'm wrong this but I think in south korea you put your fucking photo on your cv, right? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5193.96s)]
*  Like they make you put your photo on your resume, right? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5199.72s)]
*  I was shocked when I found out that like I think in Japan as well. That's so weird [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5202.12s)]
*  The first shrinking slice of the pie the common people are desperate as we've seen prior governments have promised [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5207.4800000000005s)]
*  Crackdowns on the chaebols have promised economic reform which never [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5214.12s)]
*  Materialized in a meaningful way due to how deeply the chaebols have sunk their roots into the south korean political apparatus [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5217.06s)]
*  Attempting to so much as touch those roots has had massive economic consequences and meaningfully disarming the chaebol [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5222.6s)]
*  Loki that shit would have helped me honestly because i'm [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5227.64s)]

*  Chaebols at this point could hoist all of south korean society along with them worse yet consider korea's problem with age [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5250.76s)]
*  Remember what I said in part one about how hierarchy is powerfully determined by your age [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5257.24s)]
*  How you'll be asked how old you are to determine where you belong in the pecking order [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5261.400000000001s)]

*  Well young koreans don't just have to put up with that dynamic at work [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5269.08s)]
*  They have to endure it in every facet of their lives korea has fewer and fewer young people and an enormous elderly population that places [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5272.2s)]
*  massive expectations often in conflicting ways on young men and young women [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5279.32s)]

*  Korean young people that have been thrust into an impossible situation [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5305.8s)]
*  Their incredibly confucianist society has been captured by the chayballs [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5308.5199999999995s)]

*  Population christmas tree turned into a fucking upside down pyramid. Hmm [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5398.36s)]
*  hmm [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5403.32s)]
*  Hmm [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5405.0s)]
*  Perhaps the the one group of people in the millions that were fucking routinely shitting on have something to do with that. I don't know [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5405.879999999999s)]
*  Expectations are both higher and they were able themselves to carry the expectations of korea's ultra-confucianist demands upon their backs [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5413.299999999999s)]
*  But you you are stuck in an era of stagnation [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5420.12s)]
*  You are one cog in an enormous machine competing against countless other cogs for a pittance of coin [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5422.68s)]
*  And ambitiously a shred of respect of self-worth of belonging [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5427.96s)]
*  But instead of respect you are awarded with disrespect for your efforts disrespect from your elders disrespect from your peers [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5431.96s)]
*  disrespect even from your [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5439.46s)]
*  Subordinates every year hundreds of thousands of korean young men like yourself are conscripted against their will into the military [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5441.24s)]
*  If you choose not to serve you might face jail time future employers might refuse to hire you if they see you didn't do [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5447.8s)]
*  Your time in the military these two years are treated less like actual time in the military and more like a hazing ritual [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5452.92s)]
*  Cruel and grueling for absolutely no good reason [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5458.12s)]
*  Once you get out of the military you then have to return to civilian life and find jobs that can support a whole family [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5460.84s)]
*  On your own you have to run the gauntlet and wear the suits and suffer the indignity of slave-like labor [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5464.6s)]
*  And that's the best case scenario for you if you aren't born into a position of privilege [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5469.56s)]
*  If you aren't born into such a position of privilege [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5473.4s)]
*  Where you can't leverage your family's resources or prestige or network [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5475.48s)]
*  Then you must carry all of these expectations as well as a 10 ton weight of societal [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5478.76s)]
*  Wow, it's a good thing we don't do this. I mean we do we do do this in many respects [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5483.24s)]
*  But you have to understand like it's it's much more dire. I think the income inequality economic inequality income inequality is much more dire [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5488.04s)]
*  And also on top of that they have you know mandatory conscription it's just like in america [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5497.32s)]
*  The neoliberal beacon of prosperity [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5503.0s)]
*  There's always the fallacy of choice here. Okay, it's hellish [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5506.2s)]
*  It's a it's a nightmare scenario and we have a lot of people that we uh, you know put in our crosshairs [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5510.12s)]
*  We have other enemies other societal villains that we can always point to to look down upon and push aside [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5516.04s)]
*  We do it on the virtue of white supremacy in many instances [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5520.919999999999s)]
*  And I think that there is like a finite amount of bigotry [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5524.839999999999s)]
*  That everyone has it's like the trump battery phenomena, right? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5528.94s)]
*  We only have like only so much bigotry that we can for we can focus on at any given moment [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5533.18s)]
*  so [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5539.9800000000005s)]
*  our bigotry spectrum [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5540.78s)]
*  In a nation full of immigrants and in a nation where like, you know people talk about trade issues gay issues [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5542.62s)]
*  yada yada yada [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5547.9800000000005s)]
*  Is is maybe a little bit more focused on all these other [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5549.58s)]
*  Subgroups instead of just women it seems like it seems like in south korea. They're like [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5553.900000000001s)]
*  They've they've well defined [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5559.5s)]
*  their anger and frustration directly [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5562.46s)]
*  towards just women in general [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5565.66s)]
*  whereas [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5568.38s)]
*  We're too racist to be as misogynistic [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5569.58s)]
*  If if that makes sense, we're too [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5572.780000000001s)]
*  Xenophobic we're too racist. We're too islamophobic. We're too homophobic to to also hyper focus on on women [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5575.24s)]
*  We still do a healthy number, you know, we still do a healthy bit of women hate around these parts [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5581.74s)]
*  Okay, don't don't make a mistake. Don't [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5587.0199999999995s)]
*  Don't get it confused [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5590.14s)]
*  You know some more than others, but I would say that our bigotry is spread too thin like a real [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5592.22s)]
*  jack-of-all-trades master of none type situation whereas [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5599.66s)]
*  I think the the korean men have specked into radical misogyny [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5603.74s)]
*  and they have become [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5608.7s)]
*  Expert like, you know tier tier one operators of of being [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5610.38s)]
*  Misogynistic so much so that they're now talking about misinjury [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5615.1s)]
*  South korea needs a hasana channel to hate of the incels and protect the women [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5618.22s)]
*  Yeah saying that after america elected a rapist felon over a woman is crazy [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5621.34s)]
*  Okay, see that's a great fucking take we elected a rapist felon over a woman [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5625.74s)]
*  But why he said he was going to mass deport? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5632.7s)]
*  20 million immigrants, okay [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5636.84s)]
*  20 million immigrants, you know [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5640.46s)]
*  You think if south korea did an israel type thing where they start conscripting women, too [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5644.46s)]
*  Would that alleviate the gender war because for all of its crimes the apartheid state doesn't have a gender war issue [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5647.9s)]
*  Maybe probably not though [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5652.78s)]
*  Because I think the incels that also simultaneously want women to be conscripted because i've heard that before [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5655.02s)]
*  Would probably will probably be like bitches can't fight dude [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5660.46s)]
*  Ha these broads they can't fucking fight israel does have a rape war issue. Yeah, that's also true. There's like [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5664.7s)]
*  Israel has its own version of gender war shit [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5671.820000000001s)]
*  Shame and having not all of these expectations are levied on men and none are levied on women women seem to have it so easy [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5674.780000000001s)]
*  They just have to also I don't think you want to train the entire female population [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5680.22s)]
*  In in hand-to-hand combat and because I feel like I feel like they're gonna start beating ass. You know what I mean? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5684.62s)]
*  Maybe it's not [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5690.7s)]
*  Dude [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5692.54s)]
*  Seeing seeing the way that shit has you know, she's seen the way the shit has unfolded in south korea [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5693.5s)]
*  I don't know if you want [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5699.58s)]
*  All of the women to be able to do hand-to-hand combat. Maybe it's the best idea. I don't know [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5701.5s)]
*  Maybe it is, you know equalize the field women about to do an autumn waffen [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5706.78s)]
*  But for you know radical misandry look good and stay quiet and cook the meals [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5710.86s)]
*  That's all that society expects of them and they can't even do just that while we men are expected to do everything else [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5715.0199999999995s)]
*  To provide for the family to build a generational wealth to pay for the dates to pay for the places the women live and the clothes [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5720.46s)]
*  They wear and the food they eat to serve in the military against our will all while being [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5724.700000000001s)]
*  Disrespected by everyone around us by the elderly who don't understand why we aren't doing as well as they did by foreigners who don't understand [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5728.84s)]
*  The expectations our society places on us and by our own women who seem to expect more from us [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5735.34s)]
*  Than what we can provide and accuse us of crimes that we aren't committing something must be wrong [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5740.9400000000005s)]
*  The system is failing us because the pieces aren't in the right place. What could it be? I don't know man [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5745.5s)]
*  I feel like I feel like if it's not a crime a lot of the stuff that we've seen from the fucking radical incels out there [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5749.82s)]
*  Claiming that women are doing a radical misandry. I think that should be a crime even if it wasn't maybe they should be [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5757.66s)]
*  crimes [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5764.78s)]
*  From where i'm standing it seems like it is a crime [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5765.9s)]
*  It needs to be dealt with somehow [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5769.18s)]
*  The people are supporting it to the government the sons are supporting it to them [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5771.26s)]
*  I know he's talking about the insult perspective the younger are also there is validity to what they're saying for the record [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5773.9s)]
*  I like all jokes aside. This is something that I was talking about as well where [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5778.54s)]
*  like this is this is precisely what I was mentioning when I said like [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5783.82s)]
*  This doesn't this kind of attitude doesn't just come out of nowhere. Okay, people don't just like learn [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5787.74s)]
*  It's not because south koreans watch like a shit ton of andrew tay videos, okay? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5793.9s)]
*  If anything some of these dudes could teach a thing or two to entertain about how to properly be a misogynist [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5798.46s)]
*  but there is validity to a lot of the the [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5804.3s)]
*  Anger and resentment that south korean men feel [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5807.9s)]
*  It's just being misdirected as always against someone else that they have [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5811.34s)]
*  Uh that they're considering is like beneath them [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5816.14s)]
*  It's a case of punching down [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5819.18s)]
*  um [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5821.42s)]
*  People get mad at me and say hasan why do you you know compare everything to america? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5822.38s)]
*  But like I live here and also my audience is a majority american [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5825.9s)]
*  so [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5831.58s)]
*  It's no different in in thinking that like your haitian immigrant neighbors are eating your cats and dogs and stealing your social safety nets [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5832.54s)]
*  And stealing your rent in fucking springfield, ohio [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5839.42s)]
*  when your town is in a state of disrepair because [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5843.18s)]
*  There's no there's no adequate job prospects for you [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5846.62s)]
*  And there's no adequate housing for you [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5850.38s)]
*  and of course [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5853.26s)]
*  In that process you're just like looking for someone to blame for why you feel the way that you feel you're looking for [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5854.54s)]
*  someone [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5861.18s)]
*  um [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5861.98s)]
*  You're looking for solutions and i'm sure that there are plenty of people in south korea just like in [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5862.94s)]
*  uh [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5869.0199999999995s)]
*  North america there are plenty of people who will point the finger of blame at those who were [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5869.66s)]
*  Even more underserved than you supported it to their elders [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5875.259999999999s)]
*  But the women they want more they expect more and they offer disrespect instead of appreciation for the suffering [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5878.86s)]
*  We must endure on their behalf. Why do the women insist on piling more onto us? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5884.459999999999s)]
*  We cannot take anymore our backs are breaking we are at the point of madness [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5889.900000000001s)]
*  We cannot tolerate a single straw further not one more step and so every step every encroachment also this kind of [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5893.74s)]
*  This kind of division amongst gender [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5900.46s)]
*  like [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5902.78s)]
*  Having any sort of division within the working class is only beneficial for one group [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5903.58s)]
*  And in south korea, they have a name is chaebols, right? Like those who benefit from sitting at the tippy top of society [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5908.46s)]
*  Will of course sit back and be like great they're fighting each other instead of fucking fighting us awesome [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=5916.54s)]

*  Of this guy he's goading in south korea labor force participation by women is nearly the lowest among oecd countries [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6160.62s)]
*  But the gender pay gap in south korea is not amongst the worst. It is the actual worst amongst all oecd countries [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6167.42s)]
*  duke university's journal of korean studies reports that in korea in 2020 the median earnings of women working full time was 32 percent lower than [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6173.42s)]

*  Women in korea hold only 10 percent of managerial positions in the private sector when the average for oecd countries is 30 percent [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6185.98s)]
*  And perhaps most seriously of all a disproportionately high number of women work in precarious jobs that pay low wages and provide few employee benefits [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6192.22s)]
*  Little job security and limited labor rights, which you've seen firsthand as a result of your protests when the women except for gran [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6198.86s)]

*  They aren't protesting a swimsuit or a hand signal either [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6208.86s)]

*  They want to be able to engage in the same free speech that you do without being fired or forcibly resigned or harassed [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6220.06s)]
*  actions and intentions [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6225.34s)]
*  And ultimately the end result is if the women are allowed to work and have labor protections and have a better fairer wage [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6227.18s)]
*  Your burden your expectations become lighter because you no longer have to be the sole breadwinner [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6232.06s)]
*  You don't have to be the one that always gets a high paying job to cover the cost of two people because now the women [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6236.54s)]
*  Can also get a job and you can have two medium paying jobs reducing the burden on everyone [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6240.700000000001s)]
*  But I know it's not that simple. That's not really a solution at all. Is it what good is having two jobs if everyone still suffers [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6245.26s)]
*  There are greater far more insidious systematic problems [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6251.34s)]

*  It won't be easy to solve these issues [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6261.58s)]

*  State of south korean society. That's not what i'm saying the insecurity of men does play a major role [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6668.3s)]

*  politics the president that came after roe moohyun you will recall was the former ceo of hyundai engineering and construction which nowadays has [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6691.58s)]
*  Been absorbed by hyundai motor group the core of the many spin-off companies that together compose the complex web which constitutes the hyundai che ball [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6698.0599999999995s)]
*  Lee myung bak was no political newcomer [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6704.78s)]
*  He had served as the mayor of seoul in 2002 and given roe moohyun's unpopularity at the time and the ongoing investigations into alleged corruption [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6706.86s)]
*  Lee myung bak was able to take the presidency in a landslide [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6714.139999999999s)]
*  His platform was simple. He promised to reform and reinvigorate the economy to strengthen relations with the united states and to deal with north korea [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6717.98s)]
*  Almost immediately after taking power though lee proceeded to negotiate a controversial free trade agreement with the united states and pushed for [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6724.7s)]
*  Privatization of public companies like his predecessors [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6730.54s)]
*  He conceded ground to the che balls and to the united states and built his power off of economic legitimacy [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6733.26s)]
*  But lee was no reformer at heart. He was of the che balls and by the che balls and for the che balls [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6739.1s)]
*  He was their man in the chair now. Look, I know i've simplified korean politics to an extraordinary extent [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6743.26s)]
*  These leaders are more than just walking corruption scandals [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6747.9s)]
*  There's a ton of political nuance that i'm not touching upon because they're outside of the scope of this video [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6750.06s)]
*  But as you will see corruption runs very deep in the south korean government and continues to do so to this very day [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6753.74s)]
*  Lee's presidency came and went and though allegations of corruption emerged and they never went anywhere [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6758.54s)]
*  It wasn't until 2018 in the wake of another corruption scandal [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6762.62s)]
*  Which we'll soon get to that lee myung bak was investigated and eventually arrested and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on charges of corruption [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6765.42s)]
*  Reuters reported at the time that the seoul central district court found lee guilty of embezzlement of about 24.6 billion korean won [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6772.22s)]
*  About 21.77 million dollars from a private auto parts maker headed by his brother [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6777.900000000001s)]
*  And he also accepted bribes from korea's largest che ball samsung and from other capital interests as well [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6782.38s)]
*  But lee's corruption pales in comparison to that of his successor the first female president of south korea and the first female head of state [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6787.82s)]
*  At east asia park geon-hee [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6793.42s)]

*  Now park was already a well-known politician in south korea prior to her becoming president [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6817.0199999999995s)]
*  I leave me on bach the former president in their party's last primaries [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6820.62s)]
*  And so her name was already very well established amongst the voting public and particularly in the conservative gmp party [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6823.34s)]
*  If you don't recognize the name park geon-hee. Oh color me surprised. It was a conservative woman [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gktfNY4C4UY&t=6828.0599999999995s)]
