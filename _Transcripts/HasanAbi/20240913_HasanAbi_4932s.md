# The Secret Behind Trump And Laura Loomer | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI)
*  You've never, she's never brought it up in bed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=0.0s)]
*  So I've never heard of it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3.6s)]
*  If she brought it up in bed, I'd know about it, but she doesn't. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=5.2s)]
*  Her pillow talk is the best. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=8.92s)]
*  Her pillow talk does not feature 9-11, which of course was tragic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=10.96s)]
*  That is looming on everyone's minds. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=21.76s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=24.52s)]
*  Damn, the way he's talking about Laura fondly. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=25.52s)]
*  Laura, I don't control her. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=51.44s)]
*  She's a fiery woman. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=53.92s)]
*  I can't control her even if I wanted to. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=56.0s)]
*  Believe me, folks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=58.72s)]
*  She's so fiery. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=60.6s)]
*  She's so fiery, Laura. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=63.02s)]
*  She's a real, real fierce woman, kind of like Evita. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=65.6s)]
*  Evita, my love. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  She's a free spirit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=73.68s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=74.68s)]
*  She's a free spirit. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=75.68s)]
*  She's a free spirit. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=78.36s)]
*  She's fiery. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=79.88s)]
*  She's a passionate woman. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=81.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I can't tell Laura what to do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=82.92s)]
*  Laura is a supporter of a lot of supporters, but I so I don't know what exactly you're [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=85.12s)]
*  referring to. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=90.28s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=91.28s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=92.28s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=93.28s)]
*  Laura is a supporter. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=94.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=95.28s)]
*  She is. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=96.28s)]
*  She is a strong person. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=97.28s)]
*  She's got strong opinions and I don't know what she said, but that's not up to me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=98.28s)]
*  She's a supporter, please. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=102.0s)]
*  This goes against your narrative of being ace. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  No, dude, he's still ace. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=106.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=108.72s)]
*  He's still ace. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=109.72s)]
*  I stand by that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=110.72s)]
*  Also briefly, briefly for the sake of, you know, having a funny moment. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=111.72s)]
*  I don't know what he sees in Laura Loomer, not to come across like Marjorie Taylor green, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=116.96s)]
*  who is like very obviously jealous because Trump has like a slot for at least one ugly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=122.84s)]
*  woman that doesn't fit the standard of the women that he surrounds himself with. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=128.6s)]
*  And like, it's clear to me that Marjorie wanted to be that like freakish demon looking woman [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=133.3s)]
*  by his side and Trump completely sidestepped her and went to Laura instead. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=139.16s)]
*  I don't know what he sees in her. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=144.12s)]
*  I don't know, but they're fighting and it's really funny that they're fighting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=145.92s)]
*  On your plane. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=150.32s)]
*  A lot of people do. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=151.32s)]
*  It's a very big plane. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=152.6s)]
*  Come on, Laura is an ugly dude, bro. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=154.08s)]
*  Laura Loomer is not ugly because there's a different category. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=156.52s)]
*  Okay, that's it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=160.64s)]
*  Like that's the only reason because like saying that she's ugly would not fit the term. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=162.44s)]
*  She is in the Marjorie Taylor green category. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=167.48s)]
*  Okay, which is like a different thing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  It's just like a it's not like it doesn't read as human. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  You're like, oh, I've seen this before. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  This is a hard to look at type of situation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=181.6s)]
*  And I think like, I think this is just something that you see normally in like, I don't know, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=184.6s)]
*  like horror movies or something like she's scary. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Theory would be the term to describe her physical appearance. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=194.44s)]
*  She made remarks about your opponent. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=199.04s)]
*  She also espoused conspiracy theories. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=201.04s)]
*  Chatters. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=203.8s)]
*  You don't need to be that quick. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=204.8s)]
*  Okay, there's one, two, three, four chatters that had immediate links ready to go in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  chat. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=214.28s)]
*  Ain't nobody wants to see Laura Loomer that much man. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=215.28s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=218.24s)]
*  I am personally trying to I'm personally trying to avoid seeing Laura Loomer while talking [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=219.24s)]
*  about her and you're like, no, let me prove let me prove that she's ugly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=224.16s)]
*  We know man. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=228.08s)]

*  It's about 9-11. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=230.08s)]
*  Do you disavow those remarks? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=231.08s)]
*  Well, to see what the remarks are. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  You're telling me for the first time we're here about we're here discussing the destruction. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=235.72s)]
*  That's so dumb. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=241.0s)]
*  Media is so stop talking. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=242.0s)]
*  Stop talking about Laura Loomer's 9-11 remarks. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  She's done so much worse. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=247.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=248.76s)]
*  I don't know why they're like, oh, she said it was an inside job. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=249.76s)]
*  One, a ton of Americans also believe it and two, it's the exact type of sentiment that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  is like vague enough that you can actually show conclusive evidence. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=258.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=262.96s)]
*  Like, there's enough there's enough like lack of cooperation amongst intelligence agencies [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=263.96s)]
*  and the fact that like the hijackers were trained on US soil. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=269.4s)]
*  The fact that Osama bin Laden was personally also trained by the America State Department [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=273.44s)]
*  at the time when he was a revolution or sorry, an counter-revolutionary fighter against the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=281.56s)]
*  USSR like please. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=288.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=290.24s)]
*  Stop being a truther. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=291.24s)]
*  I'm not I'm not saying like George W. Bush did 9-11 personally. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=292.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's not what I'm saying at all. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  But the idea but the idea that like what do you call it? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=300.4s)]
*  Like that that is one of our worst statements when it's like there are depend defensible [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=304.08s)]
*  aspects of that sentiment that you can point to real historical evidence is silly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm not like a jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams kind of guy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=319.08s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying at all. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=320.08s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=321.96s)]
*  I think is personally to to hyper focus on that when there's like a million other things [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=323.12s)]
*  that are way worse that she has done in the past week. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=329.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=333.08s)]
*  It's like pointing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=334.08s)]
*  Adolf Hitler by bringing up that he was ashe cheeks at painting. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=336.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=341.0s)]
*  Like I feel like that's not the worst thing he did. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=342.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=344.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=345.4s)]
*  Don't call call me crazy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=346.4s)]
*  I feel like his art is bad objectively but like that's probably not the worst thing that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=347.68s)]
*  he did. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=352.92s)]
*  You know, I feel like there's a list out there of significantly worse things that he did. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=353.92s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's like saying OJ Simpson was a bad tipper. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=359.0s)]
*  Of San Francisco and California by a person this 9-11 truth is embedded painting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=362.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=368.48s)]
*  And when we're talking about Laura Loomer, the Adolf Hitler comparison is not, you know, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=369.48s)]
*  is not a ridiculous comparison to make obviously in terms of like Hitler's magnitude of evil. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=374.56s)]
*  Yes, but it's in the same direction. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=381.36s)]
*  We are talking about a person who has called herself a white nationalist. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=383.62s)]
*  What the oh my God. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=389.44s)]
*  Isn't she Jewish though? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=390.44s)]
*  Yes, it doesn't matter. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=391.96s)]
*  So is Stephen Miller and he's a Nazi too. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=394.08s)]
*  It's running for president. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=396.96s)]
*  So I don't even know what you're talking about. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=398.12s)]
*  I do know that she may have said something based on what you're telling me, but I don't [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=399.96s)]
*  know what she said. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=404.84s)]
*  Yeah, they should. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=405.84s)]
*  The media should ask about this. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=406.84s)]
*  Your eyes look so good. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=407.84s)]

*  Love it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=412.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=413.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=414.84s)]

*  which of course was tragic, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=603.68s)]
*  but the silver lining was that the Trump Tower [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=606.0s)]

*  was the tallest. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=656.52s)]
*  And then when they built the World Trade Center [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=658.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=701.52s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you... [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=702.3599999999999s)]
*  No, I will, maybe Springfield. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  Maybe Aurora, maybe both. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=706.52s)]
*  We'll go there. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=707.36s)]
*  I can say this. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=708.1999999999999s)]
*  We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=709.52s)]
*  Large deportations. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=714.1999999999999s)]
*  We're gonna get these people out. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=715.72s)]
*  We're bringing them back to Venezuela. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=716.88s)]
*  You know, he told Biden he's not accepting anybody. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=718.96s)]
*  He's gonna deport the Haitian migrants to Venezuela. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=721.72s)]
*  Nice, man. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=725.4s)]
*  Good stuff. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=727.16s)]
*  Here, if you needed further evidence that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  he don't give a... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=730.12s)]
*  About what he's talking about. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=730.96s)]
*  Also they're legal. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=732.0s)]
*  The Venezuelans in Aurora are legal. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=733.36s)]
*  They have TPS. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=735.64s)]
*  So do the Haitians in Springfield. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=736.76s)]
*  They have TPS. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=738.52s)]
*  They moved all their criminals, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=740.12s)]
*  not all of them, but the rest are moving in now. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  They emptied their jails in Venezuela, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=744.64s)]
*  emptied their criminals, emptied the nests. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=746.6s)]
*  They call them nests of bad people. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=748.76s)]
*  They're all now in the United States [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=750.64s)]
*  and they're now taking over cities. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=752.24s)]
*  It's like an invasion from within. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=754.02s)]
*  And we're gonna have the largest deportation [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=756.16s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=758.44s)]
*  And we're gonna start with Springfield and Aurora. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=760.2s)]
*  The mayor of Springfield, Ohio, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=764.32s)]
*  the police chief, the Republican governor of Ohio, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=765.72s)]
*  have all debunked this story about people eating pets. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=768.08s)]
*  And now there are bomb threats at schools [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=770.44s)]
*  and kids being evacuated. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=772.24s)]
*  Why do you still spread this false story? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=774.2800000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=776.4000000000001s)]
*  The real threat is what's happening at our border. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=777.24s)]
*  Because you have thousands of people being [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=779.2800000000001s)]
*  by illegal migrants coming in and also dying. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=781.0s)]
*  You have women dying as they come up. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=784.4000000000001s)]
*  They're coming up in large groups. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=787.6s)]
*  We call it a caravan. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=790.2s)]
*  I think I came up with that name, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=791.44s)]
*  because 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=793.32s)]
*  And you have large numbers of women. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=796.44s)]
*  He said he came up with the name caravan? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=798.4s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=801.08s)]
*  And being in those caravans coming up to this country. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  And then when they get here, they can go into the country [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=805.08s)]
*  and they end up being sex slaves and everything else. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=807.96s)]
*  Those are your real problems, not the problem that you're [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=814.08s)]
*  Mr. President, on American News, a quick question. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=814.9200000000001s)]
*  So you just said that you'll carry out [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=815.88s)]
*  the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=817.2s)]
*  How are you going to have, for example, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=820.0s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom or officials in sanctuary cities [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=822.16s)]
*  comply with that? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=824.8s)]
*  Well, you know, if you [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=826.16s)]
*  I like that for One America News, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  the problem isn't like mass deportation of, you know, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=830.24s)]
*  it's One America News chatter. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=834.36s)]
*  She's not asking the question of logistics to be like, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  this is cruel and unusual. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=839.9599999999999s)]
*  She's just saying, here will be some hurdles for you. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  How do you see, here will be some hurdles for you. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=844.88s)]
*  Like woke ass Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=847.6s)]
*  How will you overcome said hurdles? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=850.6s)]
*  You go to the people of California, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  they don't want to have sanctuary cities anymore. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=855.24s)]
*  They're tired of sanctuary cities. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  Sanctuary cities are really blocks that protect bad people [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=859.0400000000001s)]
*  from deportation and other problems. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=863.12s)]
*  And they're going to do it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=866.16s)]
*  And our federal government has tremendous power, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=867.44s)]
*  but we're not going to let [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=870.36s)]
*  He did answer the school bomb threat question. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=871.9200000000001s)]
*  He said, it doesn't matter. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  He said, that's not a problem. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=875.5600000000001s)]
*  The real problem is the migrants. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=876.96s)]
*  Okay, he did. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=879.52s)]
*  He answered it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  He's saying it don't matter that schools get bomb threats. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=882.24s)]
*  It don't matter if like a couple of Haitians [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=885.04s)]
*  are like in the process or whatever. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=886.88s)]
*  What matters is the migrants, which by the way, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=888.6s)]
*  remember, this is the type of that was the reason [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=891.8000000000001s)]
*  why everyone was very frustrated with Donald Trump [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=894.6800000000001s)]
*  in the four years of his administration. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  Cause he would do stuff like this all the time. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  And his fan base went crazy. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=902.04s)]
*  This is something that Americans need to be reminded of. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=903.76s)]
*  But because the Democratic Party [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=907.48s)]
*  is such cowardly little babies that they won't invoke that. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=908.88s)]
*  Like they won't even use this [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=913.12s)]
*  as an electorally beneficial front [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=914.48s)]
*  because they are completely captive [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=916.96s)]
*  on the immigrant agenda [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=919.9200000000001s)]
*  because they also went with a right-wing immigration bill, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=921.52s)]
*  an anti-immigrant bill, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=924.16s)]
*  which agreed to the underlying premise [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=925.64s)]
*  that immigration is a problem for national security. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=929.96s)]
*  When you do that, it's very hard for you to go back on that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  And then they double down and then they triple down [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=939.48s)]
*  and then they quadruple down. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=941.48s)]
*  So now we're stuck. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=943.12s)]
*  Good stuff. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=945.24s)]
*  Great stuff. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=946.32s)]
*  Let states even like California, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=947.2800000000001s)]
*  even though I know it's largely sanctuary state essentially, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=950.08s)]
*  but we're not gonna let that happen [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=954.12s)]
*  to the people of California. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  They want these people out. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=956.88s)]
*  They're just as scared as everybody else. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=958.52s)]
*  The people of Ohio are scared. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=960.36s)]
*  Doug, you are so wrong, especially about California. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=962.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=968.16s)]
*  That is so crazy that there's like, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=969.0s)]
*  oh yeah, people in California love, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=970.76s)]
*  like they hate migrants. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=972.36s)]
*  What are you talking about, dude? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=974.4399999999999s)]
*  There's a reason why nobody ever talks about [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=977.04s)]
*  the border crisis in California [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=978.88s)]
*  because it's not a problem at all. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=980.76s)]
*  It's so, yeah, dude, people in California [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=982.6s)]
*  wanna deport themselves. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=984.48s)]
*  They hate it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=985.56s)]
*  Peace. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=986.4s)]

*  The people of Colorado, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=989.64s)]
*  you have a governor there who's very weak. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=990.88s)]
*  He doesn't know what to do. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=992.48s)]
*  And he doesn't wanna talk about it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=993.6800000000001s)]
*  A lot of it, as per your question, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=994.88s)]
*  they don't wanna talk about what's happening. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=996.32s)]
*  They say it's so bad for the city. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=998.2s)]
*  Let's not go public. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=999.6s)]
*  Let's live with it for a little while. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1000.64s)]

*  You know what we're experiencing now [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1006.2s)]

*  by far, not even close. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1082.44s)]
*  And there are companies leaving [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1084.76s)]

*  to our country. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1090.8s)]
*  And one of the reasons I'm doing this today [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1091.96s)]
*  is to let them know you're not gonna have to leave [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1094.6s)]
*  because we're gonna take care of the problem. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1097.4s)]
*  They have a tremendous crime problem. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1099.44s)]
*  Like if you're in Los Angeles, look at the crime numbers. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1101.28s)]
*  And then you have the FBI lying about the numbers, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1103.84s)]
*  saying the numbers went down. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1106.0s)]
*  But anybody with common sense [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1107.32s)]
*  know the numbers are through the roof. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1108.72s)]
*  I didn't know they were as high as they are. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1110.04s)]
*  But think of it, how good is a person [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1111.44s)]
*  from a government agency that would release the numbers [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1113.68s)]
*  when they saw that I was unfairly targeted by ABC? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1116.84s)]
*  And you could say by the FBI with false numbers. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1121.6s)]
*  So I have great respect. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1124.04s)]
*  I have to find out who that person is or who that group is, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1125.52s)]

*  Go ahead, one more. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1128.8s)]
*  North Korea, Kim Jong-un, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1129.68s)]

*  with our adversaries? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1139.8000000000002s)]
*  I'll be able to make phone calls [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1141.4s)]

*  Crime is down as fake. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1152.92s)]
*  Why? Because I made it up. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1155.24s)]
*  I just decided, look around. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1157.0400000000002s)]
*  The vibes are- [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1158.72s)]
*  I will never forgive the Democratic Party [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1161.48s)]
*  for completely being captive to the whims of this madman [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1163.52s)]
*  and allowing the conversation on immigration [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1167.2s)]
*  to reach this boiling point. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1169.72s)]
*  Just completely, completely dropping the ball [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1171.4s)]
*  in the most, like, in such an evil fashion. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1175.92s)]
*  Just letting the entire conversation be dominated [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1180.3600000000001s)]
*  by this piece of- [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1185.0s)]
*  especially when it directly gives them [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1186.24s)]
*  an electoral advantage. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1188.92s)]
*  And beyond that, this is not even an issue [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1190.68s)]
*  that is like Israel, okay? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1193.32s)]
*  This is not an issue like Israel. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1195.68s)]
*  This is literally just- [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1197.16s)]
*  There isn't big donors that are actively pumping [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1199.32s)]
*  the Democratic Party to be like, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1203.48s)]
*  shut the fuck up about migrants. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1204.72s)]
*  They all rely on migrants. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1206.64s)]
*  That is just pure incompetence. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1209.08s)]
*  There is not even a material reason for them [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1210.88s)]
*  to actually not counter on this message, okay? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1213.36s)]
*  The actual reason for why the Democratic Party [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1217.32s)]
*  is not countering on this message [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1219.76s)]
*  is because they're tied to this right-wing immigration bill [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1221.24s)]
*  now, deliberately. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  And I said this months ago, right before October 7, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1226.24s)]
*  when Joe Biden unveiled his immigration proposal, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1229.76s)]
*  the only reason, the only reason why [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1232.7199999999998s)]
*  they are refusing to communicate, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1235.8s)]
*  the only reason why they are refusing to communicate [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1238.56s)]
*  on the anti-immigrant sentiment [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1241.36s)]
*  coming from the Republican Party [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1243.6s)]
*  being objectively insane, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1246.76s)]
*  more insane than it was before, somehow, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1249.76s)]
*  is because they are locked in. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1252.84s)]
*  They're locked in on the anti-immigrant slant themselves [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1255.0s)]
*  because they saw polls, they saw polls that said [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1257.52s)]
*  like 60% of Americans want, you know, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1260.24s)]
*  the 60% of Americans want mass deportation [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1264.1999999999998s)]
*  and they got terrified. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1266.8799999999999s)]
*  At least with Israel, at least with Israel, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  there's like a significant, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1271.0s)]
*  a significant powerful force that they can point to, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1274.04s)]
*  to be like, we're fearful that they're gonna launch [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1278.16s)]
*  massive opposition against us. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1280.76s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous regardless, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  those fears are unwarranted. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1285.32s)]
*  When it comes down to it, like fixing the housing market, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1287.08s)]
*  they can point to all the homeowners that'll be pissed off [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1290.72s)]
*  that their housing prices are going down. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1293.44s)]
*  I still think it's ridiculous [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1295.3600000000001s)]
*  and they should do the right thing on that front as well. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1296.56s)]
*  But this issue, as it pertains to the right-wing sentiment [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1299.48s)]
*  that Donald Trump is expressing about migrants, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1304.92s)]
*  is completely unacceptable. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1307.44s)]
*  It's gotten worse than 2016 and worse than 2020 [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1309.8s)]
*  and they're not even saying anything about it [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1314.08s)]
*  because they're trapped. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1316.92s)]
*  They locked themselves into this weird ass position [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1318.44s)]
*  and anyone with more than three brain cells [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1321.88s)]
*  could have seen this being a major problem. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1326.0s)]
*  When you go right, they're gonna go more right. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1329.52s)]
*  You can't win that argument. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1332.48s)]
*  Mass, you cannot outflank the Republican party on, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1334.0s)]
*  and even if you could, the question is, should you? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1337.08s)]
*  I mean, you did, I know, I've been saying this for months. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1339.76s)]
*  I mean, I've been saying this for years, technically. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1342.88s)]
*  Say this, but it wasn't long ago. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1345.92s)]
*  He said, the only way you're gonna solve the world problem [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  is Trump has to be president again. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1349.68s)]
*  And I don't say it, I didn't say it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1351.88s)]
*  I sort of would be embarrassed to say it, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1353.6s)]
*  but he said everybody was afraid of Trump. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1357.04s)]
*  He said China was afraid, Russia was afraid, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  North Korea was afraid, everybody was afraid. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1361.3999999999999s)]
*  We had no wars. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1363.52s)]
*  We defeated ISIS in four weeks [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1365.12s)]
*  and they said it was gonna take five years, right? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1368.08s)]
*  Generals in Washington. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1370.56s)]
*  I went there and met a great general [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1372.3999999999999s)]
*  and some great people and I said, go to it. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1374.1999999999998s)]
*  And he took them out in four weeks, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1377.36s)]
*  100% of the ISIS caliphate. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1379.3999999999999s)]
*  I flew there, I flew to Iraq. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1381.3999999999999s)]
*  To the field and they took them out [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1383.6s)]
*  in a very short period of time, short order. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1385.6399999999999s)]
*  We have a great military, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1388.48s)]
*  but you know a great military needs a leader. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1389.6799999999998s)]
*  If you don't have leaders, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1392.04s)]
*  then you end up with Afghanistan. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1393.32s)]
*  The worst withdrawal from a country in the history. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1395.1999999999998s)]
*  Look, I've gotten to know great people. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1399.6399999999999s)]
*  I went to Arlington at their request. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1401.6s)]
*  And I stood and I was with them for hours. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1404.36s)]
*  And I stood with them, they did a ceremony [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1406.76s)]
*  and then they asked me if I'd go down [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1408.7199999999998s)]
*  to the graves of their children. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1410.0s)]
*  They called them their children [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1411.4399999999998s)]
*  and they always will be their children. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1412.6399999999999s)]
*  And there were tears all over as they should be. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1414.16s)]
*  And they said, sir, could you take pictures with me [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1417.16s)]
*  by the grave of my son? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1419.6s)]
*  What the, a family of four in Rochester, New York [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1422.24s)]
*  was just by an illegal immigrant who came from Puerto Rico. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1424.76s)]
*  Does he think Puerto Rico is not an American territory? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1427.36s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1430.68s)]
*  Anyway, we'll look back at the new thing that they, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1432.92s)]
*  listen, anytime an undocumented migrant [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1435.32s)]
*  or someone who is suspected [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1437.24s)]
*  of being an undocumented migrant, as in Brown, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1438.4s)]
*  does anything, you're gonna hear about it [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1441.12s)]
*  from this day onward, okay? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1443.04s)]
*  And if there's nothing going on on that front, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1446.36s)]
*  then they'll just make up like they did [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1449.2399999999998s)]
*  with the, they're eating cats and dogs. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1450.84s)]
*  Have you ever met a single conservative [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1452.8s)]
*  that knows Puerto Ricans have US citizenship? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1454.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't, Democrats don't even know that half the time. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1456.1999999999998s)]
*  In one case, a daughter, and I said I'd love to. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1458.9199999999998s)]
*  And I took pictures with them for a while [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1462.76s)]
*  and then I left and that was it. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1464.76s)]
*  And I got home and I got a call from the people [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1466.08s)]
*  in the campaign, sir, the Biden people are saying [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1468.6s)]
*  that you did this for publicity. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1471.6399999999999s)]
*  If people knew how hard it was to get there, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1473.1599999999999s)]
*  because I was coming. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1475.48s)]
*  I'm gonna be real chief. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1476.44s)]
*  I learned that when you just said it. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1477.44s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1479.52s)]
*  God damn, dude. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1480.36s)]
*  Yeah, we know their priorities are, you know, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1481.96s)]
*  not exactly there. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1484.9199999999998s)]
*  When a registered Republican tried to assassinate him [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1487.08s)]
*  and they just shut the cup about that immediately. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1490.56s)]
*  But you know, if a person who even may [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1493.32s)]
*  may not be undocumented does something, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1497.1999999999998s)]
*  God forbid that very same thing [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1499.6799999999998s)]
*  that like American citizens do 10,000 times over, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1502.8799999999999s)]
*  then you'll hear about it for weeks. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1506.52s)]
*  We have no way of examining. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1508.28s)]
*  Most people have no way of examining this [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  from the lens of like individuals, okay? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1514.0s)]
*  They don't look at it and go, okay, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1516.6799999999998s)]
*  this is like a criminal, like it happens. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1518.36s)]
*  And I hope that justice is served in a swift manner. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1521.04s)]
*  No, they go, all right, this is how they all are. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1524.04s)]
*  And because they're all illegal, okay? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  Then you find out they're not illegal, okay? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  Because they have TPS, Temporary Protective Status. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1531.08s)]
*  So they have paperwork so they can work on US soil. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1533.3999999999999s)]
*  Then they go, okay, but we don't want them legally either [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1536.24s)]
*  because their IQs are low or some other. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1538.9199999999998s)]
*  That's what the problem is, okay? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1541.76s)]
*  It is this supremacist attitude that they have. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1543.76s)]
*  It's, for those of you wondering, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1547.48s)]
*  my CNN docu-series, Misinfo Nation comes out on Sunday. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1549.8s)]
*  Of these comments from Trump. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1555.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, let's start with the California thing. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1557.12s)]
*  I mean, it simply is not true. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1558.44s)]
*  He was saying if the votes were counted fairly, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1559.6s)]
*  he would win California. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1562.52s)]
*  As you rightly point out, obviously Ronald Reagan [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  in 1884 won, George H.W. Bush won in 1988. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1566.3999999999999s)]
*  Since then, a Republican has not won statewide. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1569.76s)]
*  And he will not either. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1571.96s)]
*  He knows that, but it's just one more way to amplify his, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1573.6399999999999s)]
*  really has been a frustration for him [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1577.6399999999999s)]
*  about the popular vote. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1579.68s)]
*  I think that's what he's talking about here. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1581.0s)]
*  Obviously California, the largest state, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1583.2s)]
*  and it contributes to his losing the popular vote. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1586.1200000000001s)]
*  But beyond that, I think the more important thing is [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1589.64s)]
*  if he goes to Springfield, Ohio, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1592.4s)]
*  that confirms what we were talking about earlier, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1594.28s)]
*  he's trying to keep immigration alive, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1596.24s)]
*  front and center in this campaign conversation. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1598.8s)]
*  He believes that that is something [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1601.8s)]
*  that can sort of gain ground. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1603.68s)]
*  He's not trying to keep immigration alive, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1605.8s)]
*  front and center. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1607.64s)]
*  He's trying to help migrants, okay? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1608.92s)]
*  The real principle behind this kind of movement [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1610.96s)]
*  and messaging is to basically whip up a racialized frenzy [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1614.0s)]
*  against the migrant population in this country. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1620.16s)]
*  And considering that these are not undocumented migrants, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1623.3600000000001s)]
*  but instead documented refugees [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1626.48s)]
*  with temporary protective status that happen to be black, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1629.4s)]
*  it's very obvious that they do not even want [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1633.1200000000001s)]
*  the documented migrants to be here. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1635.4s)]
*  They just don't want, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1638.16s)]
*  they need an outgroup, that's it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1640.1599999999999s)]
*  They need an outgroup to radicalize against. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1642.12s)]
*  Two bomb threats, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1644.3999999999999s)]
*  they had to close two schools in Springfield, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1645.2399999999998s)]
*  they had to close down City Hall. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1647.08s)]
*  That he was unable to do at the debate, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1648.8s)]
*  but imagine all that would do for that town of Springfield. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1651.12s)]
*  Let's bring in Donnie O'Sullivan [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1655.08s)]
*  to the conversation as well. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1656.6799999999998s)]
*  And on the topic of Afghanistan, Donnie, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1658.4399999999998s)]
*  and then you can leap off on whatever fact check [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1661.6399999999999s)]
*  you see of import on this, because there is a lot. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1665.28s)]
*  He said, and seemed to indicate that there were 18 months [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1667.84s)]
*  in his presidency where there were no casualties [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1671.08s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1674.84s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1676.24s)]
*  This was a period of time that actually spanned [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1677.08s)]
*  his presidency and Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1679.76s)]
*  But he also seemed to rebuff suggestions [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1682.56s)]
*  that he had politicized the deaths [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1684.72s)]
*  of American service members [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1687.6s)]
*  by then going on to politicize the deaths [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1690.48s)]
*  of US service members saying, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1694.36s)]
*  just as if Kamala had shot them with a pistol in her hand. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1696.12s)]
*  Brianna, I mean, I think just taking all of that [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1700.8799999999999s)]
*  press conference and what we've heard [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1704.0s)]
*  through the last few days, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1705.52s)]
*  I mean, we're really through the looking glass here [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1706.6s)]
*  when it comes to, you know, you mentioned schools [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1708.72s)]
*  in Springfield, Ohio being shut down [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1711.6799999999998s)]
*  because of these conspiracy theories. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1713.6s)]
*  One thing that did stand out to me there [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1716.3999999999999s)]
*  towards the end of what we took from the press conference [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1718.56s)]
*  was he was asked about whether he would start [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1722.8799999999999s)]
*  posting again regularly on ex, formally Twitter. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1725.52s)]
*  Of course, he was kicked off ex, off of Twitter [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1728.9599999999998s)]
*  after January 6th. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1732.08s)]
*  He's now back on the platform thanks to Elon Musk, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1733.84s)]
*  but he isn't posting regularly. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1736.04s)]
*  I think that highlights something important here, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1738.32s)]
*  which is easy to get lost in all the developments [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1741.12s)]
*  that is happening is that the role of Elon Musk [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1745.3999999999999s)]
*  has in all of this, right? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1747.76s)]
*  Because Laura Loomer, who most Americans [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1748.76s)]
*  probably have not heard of until this week, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1751.6s)]
*  she was effectively canceled. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1754.44s)]
*  She was kicked off Twitter years ago. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1756.4s)]
*  Musk brought her back. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1760.6000000000001s)]
*  She now has millions of followers. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1761.92s)]
*  Her posts are going viral all over the world. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1764.24s)]
*  She has become and been made relevant in part [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1768.3600000000001s)]
*  by Elon Musk, and of course, you can see [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1771.96s)]
*  over the past few weeks all the other ways [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1774.2s)]
*  that Musk has been helping Trump actively promoting posts [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1775.6000000000001s)]
*  and also hosting discussions with him. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1779.76s)]
*  So I think that's just one thing to mention here. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1782.8799999999999s)]
*  And just back to the idea that Trump doesn't know [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1786.9199999999998s)]
*  really what Laura Loomer is about, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1791.8s)]
*  you don't have to dig hard for these posts. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1794.52s)]
*  I mean, it's literally, every second post [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1798.4399999999998s)]
*  is something toxic, is something hateful from Laura Loomer. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1802.9199999999998s)]
*  Daniel Dale, I mean, you've followed Trump [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1807.84s)]
*  and some of these dubious claims better than most. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1811.3999999999999s)]
*  What did you take from that press conference? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1814.1999999999998s)]
*  I thought you all did fantastic fact-checking, truly. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1816.9599999999998s)]
*  You barely need me on this panel anymore. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1819.56s)]
*  The California claim is absolute. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1821.1999999999998s)]
*  Fact-checking is accurate. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1822.04s)]
*  I think, it was great. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1823.52s)]
*  But the California claim is bonkers. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1825.52s)]
*  It's one thing to say I would have won a Pennsylvania [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1827.3999999999999s)]
*  if the count was honest. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1829.8799999999999s)]
*  The count is, of course, honest in swing states too, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1831.4399999999998s)]
*  but he lost California by five million votes, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1833.84s)]
*  about 30 points. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1836.24s)]
*  So even under the wildest imaginary conception [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1837.24s)]
*  of voter fraud, election fraud in this country, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1840.2s)]
*  that's still bananas. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1842.52s)]
*  He said again, as he usually has, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1844.3600000000001s)]
*  that ISIS was defeated in four weeks during his presidency. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1846.4s)]
*  In fact, the ISIS caliphate, or so-called caliphate, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1849.48s)]
*  was declared liberated about two years into his presidency. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1851.8000000000002s)]
*  He spoke of supposedly thousands of people [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1855.0s)]
*  being by migrants under Biden-Harris. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1857.8000000000002s)]
*  There have been some homicides [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1860.0400000000002s)]
*  in which undocumented people are accused. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1861.76s)]
*  I don't have a precise number, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1863.8400000000001s)]
*  but it is nowhere near thousands. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1865.16s)]
*  I do. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1867.24s)]
*  How do you not have a precise number on that, Daniel? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1868.08s)]
*  Your whole thing is fact-checking. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1870.24s)]
*  The number is 26. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1872.24s)]
*  In the fiscal year 2024, the number is 26. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1873.84s)]
*  It's kind of wild that when I brought this up [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1877.6399999999999s)]
*  to a American politician, Ro Khanna, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1880.12s)]
*  he was shocked by the number. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1884.6s)]
*  And if you remember my conversation with Ro Khanna, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  I was like, why are the Democrats [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1888.8799999999999s)]
*  not just constantly talking about this? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1890.6s)]
*  Overall homicides and manslaughter in this country [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1893.48s)]
*  is like around 20,000, okay? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1895.84s)]
*  Undocumented migrants contribute 29, like two nine. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1898.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1901.8s)]
*  He said accused, not convicted. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1902.64s)]
*  What are you talking about, dude? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1904.16s)]
*  You could just accuse, okay. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1905.56s)]
*  I accuse every ever committed on migrants. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1907.92s)]
*  I guess then that's fine. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1911.2s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1912.68s)]
*  Where did the 29 number come from? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1914.28s)]
*  It's not 29, it's 25, I think. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1915.68s)]
*  It's the Customs and Border Patrol. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1917.72s)]
*  .gov. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1919.92s)]

*  We have to prioritize our own people [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1933.04s)]
*  and those who actually have a place in the US, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1934.32s)]
*  not people who don't have jobs, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1935.84s)]
*  who don't have anywhere to go, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1937.04s)]

*  That's really interesting copium [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1943.52s)]
*  because Springfield, Ohio, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1944.96s)]
*  that we're talking about specifically, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1946.44s)]
*  literally had a ton of jobs readily available [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1948.52s)]
*  that they could not fill [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1951.72s)]
*  because it was a town that the industry had left behind. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1952.8s)]
*  Okay, Springfield, Ohio got an influx of Haitian migrants [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1957.12s)]
*  specifically because there was need for working hands. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1961.8s)]
*  They went there and they filled those roles. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1965.96s)]
*  That's the reason why the guy typing, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1968.76s)]
*  this is definitely unemployed, oh, 100%. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1971.24s)]
*  Springfield, Ohio's taxable revenue [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1973.4s)]
*  increases a consequence of this, okay? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1975.4s)]
*  By a lot, as a matter of fact. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1978.16s)]

*  25% increase in taxable revenue year over year. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=1981.12s)]

*  Anyway, does this make you reconsider? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2064.68s)]
*  Does what I just told you [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2067.72s)]

*  Many nurses are as stupid as the cops they're married to. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2071.12s)]
*  I'm imagining Andrew being married to a cop. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2074.0s)]

*  and our resident nurse is not even in the chat [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2082.2s)]

*  Okay, all jokes aside, I wanna know if this guy, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2088.3199999999997s)]
*  like got any new takeaway from this [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2092.4s)]

*  Did you just nothing, did nothing go through? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2102.56s)]
*  Like did any of the information that I gave you register? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2105.88s)]
*  Springfield, Ohio is in a state of disaffair [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2109.7200000000003s)]
*  before the Haitian migrants actually came in. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2112.12s)]
*  The reason why they went there [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2114.16s)]
*  is because it's a very poor town [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2115.2400000000002s)]
*  that needed a lot of people working these jobs [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2116.88s)]
*  that were now readily available. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2120.96s)]
*  That's the reason why they went there. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2122.92s)]
*  They also did get those jobs. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2124.76s)]
*  They also increased the city's taxable revenue by like 20%. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2127.0s)]
*  Don't you think that that's a good thing overall? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2133.64s)]
*  This is the exact same attitude [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2135.96s)]
*  that conservatives demonstrated with Hazelton, Pennsylvania. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2138.52s)]
*  They were like, oh, we would rather have a town [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2141.28s)]
*  be left behind but remain white [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2144.8s)]
*  than have a bunch of Mexicans come here [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2148.04s)]
*  and actually revitalize the town. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2150.04s)]
*  That's usually what happens. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2152.12s)]
*  Now, the real question I have to ask you is, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2154.32s)]
*  do you have this exact same kind of opinion of people [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2156.56s)]
*  that come from one state to the next? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2159.08s)]
*  They're documented US citizens, just like the Haitians are. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2161.4s)]
*  They're not US citizens, but they're documented. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2164.24s)]
*  They're not like undocumented migrants, right? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2166.36s)]
*  They have temporary protective status. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2168.48s)]
*  They're refugees. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2170.36s)]
*  They're working. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2171.56s)]
*  They got the paperwork to be able to work. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2172.4s)]
*  So do you have this kind of attitude [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2174.7599999999998s)]
*  when like there's an influx of people coming from, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2176.88s)]
*  I don't know, California to Nevada. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2179.08s)]
*  Yesterday, someone tried to make this argument. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2181.0s)]
*  Also, they got, yeah, that's nice bathroom is right. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2183.16s)]
*  They got TPS under Trump too, by the way. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2186.04s)]
*  So that's the other part of the story [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2188.2s)]
*  that's like kind of silly. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2189.56s)]
*  Venezuelans got TPS under Trump. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2191.04s)]
*  Trump also greatly accelerated, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2193.84s)]
*  Trump also greatly accelerated the sanctions on Venezuela [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2196.2s)]
*  that deliberately was to cause instability, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2201.48s)]
*  deliberately to cause chaos inside of Venezuela, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2204.68s)]
*  which of course led to a ton of more migrants [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2207.0s)]
*  coming to the United States of America. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2209.08s)]
*  Now it's not even a problem at all in terms of, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2210.9s)]
*  in terms of like Venezuelan people coming here. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2214.76s)]
*  There's no issue with this because at the end of the day, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2216.46s)]
*  the real problem always is that these guys [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2218.96s)]
*  are not able to unionize, right? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2221.12s)]
*  They're not able to participate in the workforce [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2223.74s)]
*  in the same exact ways that the documented, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2225.68s)]
*  the rest of the documented US labor force works. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2227.96s)]
*  The real solution is to allow them to, you know, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2230.32s)]
*  give them the proper documentation [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2233.92s)]
*  and allow them to unionize alongside everybody else. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2235.32s)]
*  From a location that was very far away [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2237.6000000000004s)]
*  and yet they were having the ceremony [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2240.28s)]
*  and I really felt, you know, I had them up to Bedminster, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2242.28s)]
*  most of the family members and I got to- [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2245.0s)]
*  Fair enough argument. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2247.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I accidentally banned them. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm banned. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2250.36s)]
*  Fair enough argument. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2251.2000000000003s)]
*  America is a place where everyone is known [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2252.04s)]
*  for a melting pot for a reason. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2253.6600000000003s)]
*  Do you think we should have any regulation on immigration [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2254.76s)]
*  or just let everyone in? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2256.7200000000003s)]
*  I think anyone and everyone [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2258.6000000000004s)]
*  that wants to come into this country, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2260.82s)]
*  as long as they don't have like a record [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2262.2200000000003s)]
*  that is like truly heinous or some, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2264.56s)]
*  which you can literally look at if you process them, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2266.24s)]
*  should be able to come in, yes. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2269.4s)]
*  And if they want to work for an extended period of time, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2271.44s)]
*  depending on the needs of the economy, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2273.72s)]
*  because there might be certain instances [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2276.04s)]
*  where there's like too much of a certain type of labor, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2277.72s)]
*  for example, or whatever. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2280.04s)]
*  Those are like economic reasons as to why [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2281.16s)]
*  you would restrict certain aspects of, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2283.48s)]
*  is a significantly better way [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2286.0s)]
*  to actually do national security. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2288.6s)]
*  The irony of course is that, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2291.4s)]
*  this already happens, right? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2293.28s)]
*  Like you have state by state, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2294.48s)]
*  border crossers, I guess, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2297.2400000000002s)]
*  amongst documented American citizens. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2298.88s)]
*  Nobody ever bats an eye at that. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2300.44s)]
*  No one ever goes, whoa, what if someone is a pedophile [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2302.84s)]
*  in the state of Florida, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2305.4s)]
*  and then they traveled as a state of Ohio? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2306.56s)]
*  It's like, yeah, we have a process to catch these people, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  but ultimately you're not ever gonna make this argument [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2311.2400000000002s)]
*  to make like harder boundaries among states internally. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2314.2400000000002s)]
*  The only difference is you personally have to make [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2318.76s)]
*  The only difference is you personally think [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2321.72s)]
*  that these guys that are coming in are somehow nefarious, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2324.24s)]
*  somehow bad, they're here for bad purpose. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2328.04s)]

*  What's a son's opinion on Tyler, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2332.68s)]
*  Tyler Oliver's video on Springfield? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2334.68s)]

*  and he would have never done that to us. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2399.32s)]
*  And just in finishing up with that, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2400.92s)]
*  and I appreciate the question, actually, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2402.8s)]
*  but in finishing up with that, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2404.64s)]
*  for 18 months, spoke to Abdul over the phone, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2406.72s)]
*  for 18 months, not one American soldier was shot, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2411.12s)]
*  or not one American soldier was even... [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2417.0s)]
*  It's weird, because you were president [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2421.4s)]
*  for much longer than 18 months, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2422.7599999999998s)]
*  so why do you say in 18 months [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2424.24s)]
*  not a single American soldier was shot, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  because you were president before those 18 months, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2427.6s)]
*  and it seems like a lot more American soldiers [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2429.52s)]
*  were in that process, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2433.16s)]
*  which you also openly admitted during the debate [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2434.96s)]
*  is why you negotiated with Abdul. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2437.12s)]
*  I live near Hazelton, Pennsylvania. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2439.96s)]
*  People are still so insane, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2441.4s)]
*  even though the migrant population brought back the mall there [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2442.36s)]
*  from the brink of closing and opened several more businesses, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2444.56s)]
*  and have increased the quality of life there by a ton. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2447.04s)]
*  Used to be when I was younger, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2448.8s)]
*  but you can go hang out there for a day now. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2449.76s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2451.4s)]
*  Yeah, Hazelton, Pennsylvania is a perfect demonstration [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2452.24s)]
*  of how immigrants basically are the backbone of this country [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2456.24s)]
*  and how immigrants end up literally revitalizing places [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2459.96s)]
*  that are in a state of dire disrepair, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2463.6s)]
*  and also the reaction to Hazelton, Pennsylvania [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2466.48s)]
*  from the former residents of Hazelton, Pennsylvania, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2469.68s)]
*  some of the former residents of Hazelton, Pennsylvania, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2472.56s)]
*  is also a perfect demonstration of the fact [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2476.2s)]
*  that a lot of these people would rather die [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  than live next to fucking brown people. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2480.44s)]
*  Okay? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2483.2s)]
*  They would, there's like hella people straight up, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2484.04s)]
*  who would rather die than live next to a brown person. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2487.7999999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2492.72s)]
*  And Tucker Carlson used Hazelton as an example of a country, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2493.8399999999997s)]
*  of a county whose demographic makeup changed dramatically. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2499.04s)]
*  You have video, I've dealt with this issue before. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2503.16s)]
*  This is not my first foray into the subject matter. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2505.96s)]
*  Immigration is a major problem for me. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2508.88s)]
*  Like the way we treat immigrants in this country [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2511.3599999999997s)]
*  is obviously something that I have personal feelings about. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2513.2799999999997s)]
*  It's something that I've been covering for years and years. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2518.3199999999997s)]
*  And I've noticed that like the democratic party [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2520.6s)]
*  is completely, the democratic party is always capitulated, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2522.52s)]
*  but nowadays they've like completely dropped [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2525.56s)]
*  the counter argument, the counter messaging. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2529.4799999999996s)]
*  And beyond that, they don't even like demand [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2532.52s)]
*  any sort of like concessions from the Republicans. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2535.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is from the woke George W. Bush Institute, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2537.52s)]
*  summer of 2018, you know, those woke guys, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2543.0s)]
*  this dude is always eating. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2546.84s)]
*  Yes, I eat at the same time every day. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2547.88s)]
*  If you come in here at the same time every day, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2550.0s)]
*  you're gonna watch me eat for a little bit, okay? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2551.72s)]
*  I apologize, I'm a human being and I spend eight hours [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2553.8s)]
*  in front of the camera every day. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2556.88s)]
*  And yes, in those eight hours, one of those eight hours, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2558.2s)]
*  I'm gonna be eating. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2560.92s)]
*  You don't have to watch me eat though. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2562.32s)]
*  You can just turn it off or you can just, you know, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2564.32s)]
*  watch the three minute ad break [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2567.84s)]
*  at the top of the hour, for example. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2568.88s)]
*  But if you wanna watch me eat uninterrupted, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2571.16s)]
*  then all you need to do is subscribe for $6, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2574.16s)]
*  even though it's 30% off right now. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2577.68s)]
*  So I don't know what that means math wise [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2579.08s)]
*  or for free with the Twitch Prime, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2580.92s)]
*  you too can watch me eat uninterrupted. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2582.8799999999997s)]
*  Do you respond to someone commenting on how you eat [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2587.04s)]
*  at the same time every day, every day? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2588.8799999999997s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2590.3999999999996s)]
*  That's why a lot of times I feel like, you know, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2591.96s)]
*  days just kind of melt into one another, you know? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2595.3999999999996s)]
*  It's just like, I have no concept of time anymore. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2598.52s)]
*  I do feel sometimes like a robot [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2602.92s)]
*  that is just repeating the same things [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2605.84s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2607.72s)]
*  Oftentimes the same points over and over and over again. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2610.12s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2614.2s)]
*  Anyway, it's not just Tucker Carlson's video. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2615.28s)]
*  There is a video that I've done on Tucker Carlson. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2617.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's find that one here in terms of like immigration. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2619.88s)]
*  Hi, Tucker Carlson's white pilling your dad's every night. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2623.32s)]
*  On the left, you may have noticed [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2626.8s)]
*  that everything is about race, everything. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2627.84s)]
*  Even things that have nothing to do with race. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2629.5600000000004s)]
*  There's one thing Tucker Carlson hates. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2632.4s)]
*  It's continuing to wear bow ties. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  That and talking about race, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2636.1600000000003s)]
*  unless it's about preserving the white race. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2638.0800000000004s)]
*  Everybody gets a safe space except white men. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2641.0800000000004s)]
*  They are hated and despised. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2643.44s)]
*  Attacking white men for being white men. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2644.76s)]
*  Attacked white men for their privilege [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2646.48s)]
*  in a whole bunch of ways. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2647.84s)]
*  I was handed a box of saltine crackers [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2648.6800000000003s)]
*  and in a group chat during the event, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2650.88s)]
*  a student Photoshopped my face onto a cracker. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2652.88s)]
*  This is what Tucker Carlson does. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2655.0800000000004s)]
*  Isn't it funny that like dudes [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2657.0s)]
*  who used to be a part of this community [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2658.72s)]
*  or at least adjacent to this community [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2660.28s)]
*  back when I used to make these videos, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2661.88s)]
*  unironically now behaving exactly the same way [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2663.76s)]
*  as that kid that went on Tucker Carlson. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2666.88s)]
*  I'm of course talking about Boner Celly's fan base [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2668.96s)]
*  and how much they get mad about anti-white. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2672.96s)]
*  Tucker Carlson's doing with Bill O'Reilly's [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2675.48s)]
*  coveted 8pm slot on Fox News, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2677.64s)]
*  which is currently the third most popular [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2679.6s)]
*  cable news show in the country. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2681.56s)]
*  By the way, just to pause, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2683.08s)]
*  I assume that's a slur against your ethnicity, correct? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2683.92s)]
*  I've talked about this on my Twitch a lot, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2686.84s)]
*  but only the most important subjects [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2688.4s)]
*  are covered on Tucker's show, like white, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2690.6800000000003s)]
*  which is in fact something that the left [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2692.6000000000004s)]
*  is advocating for apparently. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2694.4s)]
*  But he did not notably advocate for a Georgetown professor [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  called Christine Fair did do that. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2700.28s)]
*  Imagine being a producer on Tucker's show, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2702.44s)]
*  constantly scouring the internet, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2704.6800000000003s)]
*  looking for blue checkmark Twitter users saying things [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2706.2400000000002s)]
*  while they're emotionally distraught [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2708.48s)]
*  in order to make wild claims like [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2709.92s)]
*  that the left is advocating for white. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2712.2400000000002s)]
*  Of course, this isn't how white is actually happening. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2713.88s)]
*  According to the folks Tucker is mirroring, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2716.96s)]
*  white is happening because immigration [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2718.96s)]
*  is changing the nation's demographics [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2720.96s)]
*  and it's being justified by an evil liberal plot [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2722.92s)]
*  called diversity. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2726.84s)]
*  Diversity is our strength, they screech, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2728.4s)]
*  as if that settles the conversation by itself, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2730.2000000000003s)]
*  like a magic talisman. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2732.48s)]
*  Diversity, we hear about it nonstop. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2733.92s)]
*  It's the mainstream motto. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2737.0s)]
*  Tucker's relentless attacks against diversity, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2738.7200000000003s)]
*  multiculturalism and immigrants as a whole [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  are literally identical to white supremacists, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=2743.0s)]

*  to the reality that housing being used as a vehicle for upward social mobility as wealth, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3128.2000000000003s)]
*  as wealth as a mechanism to generate wealth for yourself is at the heart of this issue. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3134.52s)]
*  This is one part of that process. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3142.28s)]
*  This is one fact that shows that treating housing as an investment, of course, is going [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3144.28s)]
*  to inevitably lead to the housing market behaving in the most predictable way possible. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3149.7200000000003s)]
*  And yes, that's why I always get mad at the YIMBYs and the NIMBYs when they like duke [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3155.7200000000003s)]
*  it out in the chat. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3160.2000000000003s)]
*  Because there's truth to both sides of that argument. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3161.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3165.0800000000004s)]
*  Because ultimately, the problem is capitalism. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3166.1200000000003s)]
*  Ultimately, the problem is the profit motive associated with the way that people analyze [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3169.0s)]
*  housing. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3174.2799999999997s)]
*  That is the real problem. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3175.08s)]
*  Housing needs to be decommoditized. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3176.92s)]
*  I am in favor of building denser housing around transit. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3179.4s)]
*  You're absolutely correct on this front. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3183.88s)]
*  That's why every time I talk about this issue, YIMBYs think I'm a YIMBY. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3186.3599999999997s)]
*  And every time I also talk about this issue, NIMBYs think I'm a NIMBY, which by the way, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3191.0s)]
*  Steph Curry is the actual NIMBY in this situation. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3196.6s)]
*  But a lot of YIMBYs who are, yes, in my back yarders, the urbanists, in my opinion, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3199.88s)]
*  openly rely far too much on market conditions when in fact the actual system is fundamentally [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3208.36s)]
*  broken as a direct consequence of market conditions. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3216.52s)]
*  If you have a bunch of upper middle class people who own homes and see their housing [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3220.2000000000003s)]
*  value as a direct way to generate net worth for themselves and as an asset that they [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3227.32s)]
*  can leverage against and borrow against, then they always want to make sure that their [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3234.6800000000003s)]
*  housing value goes up. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3239.6400000000003s)]
*  How do you make that housing value go up? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3241.1600000000003s)]
*  By reducing supply or limiting supply. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3243.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3247.88s)]
*  One of the biggest problems with housing in this country is, in my opinion, a lack of [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3248.52s)]
*  government intervention. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3254.84s)]
*  Okay? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3256.6s)]
*  A lack of direct government intervention. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3257.3199999999997s)]
*  That's what needs to happen. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3259.64s)]
*  And the irony is, given that there are more renters than there are owners of homes, that [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3261.4s)]
*  the democratic process would allow government intervention in this process. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3267.4s)]
*  Problem is, renters are poorer than homeowners. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3273.88s)]
*  And therefore, homeowners and their attitude matters more. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3278.92s)]
*  They're high propensity voters. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3282.2799999999997s)]
*  If you're a renter, you're probably a lower propensity voter than a home owner. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3284.2s)]
*  This is the real problem. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3289.7999999999997s)]
*  In a place like California where we can look for new initiatives year over year in an [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3291.96s)]
*  effort to at least attempt to decommodify housing or in an attempt to like fix at least [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3296.8399999999997s)]
*  certain aspects of the housing crisis, we get nothing done because people vote for it [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3302.2799999999997s)]
*  democratically year over year. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3307.64s)]
*  And then Governor Gavin Newsom, gruesome Gavin Newsom, destroys those initiatives. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3309.48s)]
*  The only initiative you ever get is actually some neoliberal urbanists like, oh, we can [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3315.7999999999997s)]
*  build ADUs here. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3321.64s)]

*  I don't give a yes in my backyard. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3332.44s)]

*  Please. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3339.4s)]
*  It's not about building more units. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3340.28s)]
*  It's also about building affordable units. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3342.36s)]

*  I'm stroking my right now. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3542.2s)]
*  Yeah, you got oil on your... [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3543.72s)]
*  This is far-right activist Laura Loomer and white nationalist Nick Fuentes cheering to... [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3545.08s)]
*  And they're not wrong. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3554.4399999999996s)]
*  Both met personally with Donald Trump. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3555.64s)]
*  I first met Loomer in 2017 at an event for Manosphere influencer Mike Cernovich. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3558.2799999999997s)]
*  At the time, Loomer was an activist who'd celebrated the deaths of Muslim migrants, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3564.2s)]
*  but she was being harassed by white nationalist trolls because she's a Jewish woman. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3569.08s)]
*  Since then, she's taken a strange trajectory with years somewhat in obscurity because she'd [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3573.8799999999997s)]
*  been banned from so many social media sites like Twitter. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3578.68s)]
*  When Elon Musk took over Twitter, she came back. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3582.04s)]
*  She does stunts like ambush interviews. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3585.24s)]
*  Frank, why aren't you supporting President Trump? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3587.72s)]
*  I'm a successful investigative journalist. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3590.3599999999997s)]
*  Loomer recently told CNN she's not anti-Muslim. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3592.7599999999998s)]
*  Now, some might dispute that she's entered the mainstream, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3596.2799999999997s)]
*  but she's reached the former president's elite inner circle, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3599.64s)]
*  flying to the presidential debate on Trump's plane [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3603.0s)]
*  and to New York as he observed the anniversary of 9-11. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3606.04s)]
*  A notable apparent... [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3609.56s)]
*  Somewhat Maoist here. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3610.9199999999996s)]
*  Everyone should have a house, even streamers, even though their audiences think it's a crime. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3612.7599999999998s)]
*  That's awesome. God, I love streaming, dude. This is why. Okay. I love this community. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3617.72s)]
*  I love that I'm fortunate enough to be able to build a community like this. It's fantastic. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3623.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3627.64s)]
*  Since Loomer has pushed the false conspiracy theory that 9-11 was an inside job, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3628.68s)]
*  she's been seen with Trump a lot. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3634.2s)]
*  We're here at Bedminster. I'm with the greatest president ever. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3636.2s)]
*  After rumors circulated among right-wing Twitter users, including Loomer, that Haitian... [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3639.3199999999997s)]
*  The genuine question is giving her this much airtime, good or bad? No. It's already... It's over. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3644.36s)]
*  She's already in his inner circle. Hiding the truth about her insanity is worse. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3649.0s)]
*  Okay? Up until the very moment... Look, guys, I have a policy of not highlighting Nazis on this [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3655.1600000000003s)]
*  broadcast, even if they're doing a lot of funny things that, you know, people love to clown on [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3661.32s)]
*  them for, until it gets to a certain point where they reach a prominent mainstream platform and [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3665.96s)]
*  at which point they have to be dealt with. Okay? Laura Loomer is the perfect example of this. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3671.8s)]
*  Where, like, until she reaches Trump's inner circle, she's irrelevant. Who gives a... Don't [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3678.2000000000003s)]
*  talk about it ever. Do not give her any... You know, do not give her even a moment of coverage. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3683.2400000000002s)]
*  But the moment that he... The moment that she reaches Donald Trump's inner circle, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3691.6400000000003s)]
*  then it's a problem. Okay? Then you have to cover what is going on there. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3696.36s)]
*  Is she a Zionist or a Nazi? First of all, Zionists are Nazis. What are we talking about? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3701.24s)]
*  That's number one. And number two, she is both a Zionist and a Nazi at the same time. She's [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3705.9599999999996s)]
*  reaching far more than the inner circle. Connor, you are one of my favorite, consistent, funniest [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3711.9599999999996s)]
*  members of the community. Yeah. What's not interesting... What's interesting is not that [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3717.7999999999997s)]
*  she's both a Zionist and a Nazi, because, you know, that's a distinction without a difference in [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3721.72s)]
*  many instances. What's interesting is that she is a Nazi and she's Jewish at the same time. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3725.96s)]
*  How can Zionists be Nazis? Zionism is the exact same thing as Nazism. It's just that the in-group [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3731.32s)]
*  that is supposed to be holding on to the power and racial superiority or ethnic superiority or [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3740.44s)]
*  religious superiority is different than the Nazis. And the out-group that you're supposed [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3745.16s)]
*  to be dominating is different. That's it. It's both fascist. Okay? Zionism is a fascist ideology. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3749.8s)]
*  It is an ultra-nationalist ideology built around ethnic and religious boundaries. Okay? That's it. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3758.2000000000003s)]
*  Who is considered to be ubermensch and who is considered to be untermensch in this regard [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3765.8s)]
*  is different, but the fundamentals are the same, because it is fascist. Like you purposely ignored [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3771.88s)]
*  booger Nick until he was in the inner circles of Kanye's campaign and had dinner with Trump. Exactly. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3778.84s)]
*  I never talked about Nicolas Fuentes. I never brought him chicken and waffles or had my ex-wife [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3783.1600000000003s)]
*  now make him a sandwich when he was in my house and we were hanging out, because why the fuck would [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3789.4s)]
*  I do that? Why would I give him a prominent role? Why would I platform him? That is insane, because [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3794.36s)]
*  I'm not a Nazi like some people. You know, you banned the shit out of me. Wait, where's that chatter? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3801.1600000000003s)]
*  You banned the shit out of me a few years ago for sending a Fuentes link. Yeah, of course. You know [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3807.48s)]
*  what's really funny about that? I do that and then people get real mad. They're like, oh, how dare you [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3812.2s)]
*  do that? Some people are understanding, like Hellbender, 62 month subscriber. Other people [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3816.92s)]
*  see that and literally clip it on Reddit and post it on the Boner Cheli community. Be like, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3822.12s)]
*  Hassan can't take criticism. That's why he banned a long-term community member. I'm like, yeah, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3828.2s)]
*  you should know better anyway. Immigrants are eating people's pets in Ohio. Trump repeated the [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3832.6s)]
*  claim in the debate. They're eating the dogs, the people that came in. I spoke to Loomer before the [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3838.04s)]
*  debate. She told me she's attacked as a childless woman who devotes all her time to a man who will [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3844.12s)]
*  never pay attention to her, meaning Trump. But Trump does pay attention to her and reads her reports. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3849.56s)]
*  Laura, how are you? You look so beautiful as always. You don't want to be loofered. If you're [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3855.08s)]
*  loofered, you're in deep trouble. Trump! Trump! Oh! Good morning, everybody. My name is Laura [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3859.8s)]
*  Loomer. She ran for Congress twice and lost, but she told me she built a constituency among the very [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3865.5600000000004s)]
*  pro-Trump voters in the villages, a retirement community that's important in Florida Republican [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3871.88s)]
*  politics. She called them Loomers for Loomer and they were paying attention when she began attacking [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3877.0800000000004s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis for having the temerity to run for president against Trump. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3883.0s)]
*  You are never going to be president of the United States of America. Loomer told me one of her donors [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3887.8s)]
*  let it slip that DeSantis was running for president in 2021. So on the first stop on the DeSantis, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3893.48s)]
*  she stood in front with a Trump sign and a t-shirt. Despite her new closeness to the former president, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3899.0s)]
*  some pro-Trump Republicans are very against her. Her rhetoric and her tone is... [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3904.36s)]
*  Okay, now it makes sense. Trump has become increasingly more paranoid over the years [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3911.1600000000003s)]
*  and as a direct consequence of that, he has made his circle even tighter. This is the exact same [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3916.2s)]
*  reason why he chose JD Vance, who is a bloodless, soulless, monstrous brown-noser. And this is now, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3923.8799999999997s)]
*  I assume, the reason why he has Laura Loomer in his corner because that is a ride or die. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3934.04s)]
*  It does not match the base, does not match MAGA, does not match most Republicans I know, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3941.2400000000002s)]
*  and I am completely denouncing it. I'm over it. There is a growing feud that is playing out in [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3946.92s)]
*  public today and it's really exposing tensions between Donald Trump's allies. Far-right activist [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3953.7200000000003s)]
*  Laura Loomer was seen with Trump yesterday at events commemorating 9-11, despite the fact that [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3958.92s)]
*  she previously spread conspiracy theories about those very terrorist attacks. She posted on social [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3964.6000000000004s)]
*  media saying that it was an inside job. She was also seen getting off his plane. You see the video [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3969.8s)]
*  here. This is in Philadelphia just ahead of the debate. Some of Loomer's comments, though, have [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3975.0800000000004s)]
*  proven to be too extreme for some in MAGA world. CNN's Manu Raju is following this story. Manu, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3979.8s)]
*  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is not holding back going after Loomer and now [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3986.36s)]
*  other Republicans are joining her. What are they saying? Yeah, that's right. In fact, Marjorie [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3991.2400000000002s)]
*  Taylor Greene is someone herself who has been very outspoken, very controversial in some of [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=3995.16s)]
*  her rhetoric, but she says what Laura Loomer has been saying has been going too far. She contends it [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4000.44s)]
*  does not represent the MAGA movement, does not represent former President Donald Trump. This is [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4005.64s)]
*  in the aftermath of her post about Kamala Harris's Indian heritage. That was too much for Marjorie [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4009.8799999999997s)]
*  Taylor Greene and then afterwards Loomer went to attack her on social media. So I asked her about [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4016.2s)]
*  this feud between those two. And this is what MTG said to me just moments ago. I have concerns [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4020.92s)]
*  about her rhetoric and her hateful tone. To me, many of the comments that she made. Oh my God, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4027.7200000000003s)]
*  I just realized maybe Marjorie Taylor Greene hates her because she's Jewish. Before I said, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4034.84s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene hates her because like Trump has to have one Trump can only have one ugly, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4040.12s)]
*  like freakish looking demonic woman in his corner. And like first it was Sarah fuckabee Sanders. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4045.24s)]
*  And then now it's, you know, it was supposed to be Marjorie Taylor, Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4052.4399999999996s)]
*  but like kind of Laura Loomer just like came in and, you know, cast her aside. And I thought maybe [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4058.6s)]
*  that was the reason, but now I'm thinking it could be because don't forget Alina Hubba. Alina Hubba is [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4063.9599999999996s)]
*  a smoke show. What do you mean? Alina Hubba Hubba? Are you crazy? Donald Trump does not give a shit [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4070.2s)]
*  about what women do beyond the fact that they just look good behind him. And like other dudes think [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4076.7599999999998s)]
*  that that's sick. The two angles that I think MTG, the two or three different angles here. Okay. One, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4082.6s)]
*  it could be because Marjorie Taylor Greene is anti-Semitic and thinks that Jews have space lasers, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4091.16s)]
*  which by the way, she used to think that before Israel said they're working on an actual space [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4096.68s)]
*  laser that has nothing to do with what Marjorie Taylor Greene was saying. That's totally besides [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4103.08s)]
*  the point, but she used to say Jews have space lasers and maybe she's mad that, you know, she [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4107.96s)]
*  wants it in the hands of America. And she probably thinks that Laura Loomer knows where the space [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4113.88s)]
*  laser is. That could be one reason. The other reason could be the other reason could be that [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4120.4400000000005s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is upset because she was supposed to be slotted into the hideous, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4126.52s)]
*  the hideous demonic monster category that Trump has to have around him at all times. Or last but [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4133.400000000001s)]
*  not least Marjorie Taylor Greene. And I'm sorry to say this. I know people are going to get mad. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4139.88s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is a sexual dynamo. This is a factually accurate assessment of the situation. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4144.52s)]
*  Okay, she is. You might not like it, but this is what peak sexual performance looks like. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4151.96s)]
*  We know this because she literally cheated on her husband at the time with her like weird tantric [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4159.24s)]
*  sex gym owner CrossFit gym owner, who Laura Loomer says looked like Zangief Marjorie Taylor [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4168.76s)]

*  this is my sleep paralysis demon. When did you go from politics to gossiping about who sleeps with [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4454.92s)]
*  who politics is about sometimes gossip surrounding who's sleeping with who especially because [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4460.28s)]
*  currently we're talking about Laura Loomer, a real will they won't they situation hurt between [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4469.16s)]
*  her and Donald Trump. Match Maga does not match most Republicans I know. And I am completely [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4475.24s)]

*  But Trump himself was indeed traveling with Laura Loomer in the way to Tuesday's debate. And he's [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4488.68s)]
*  someone that she has she has been within his someone has causing clearly concerns not just [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4494.52s)]
*  among Marjorie Jellegreen, but also other people who are aligned with Donald Trump worried about [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4499.080000000001s)]
*  his alliance with someone who exposes such extreme rhetoric rhetoric pushes it conspiracy theories [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4503.96s)]
*  and the like this was Senator Lindsey Graham just moments ago told our colleague Ted Barrett here [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4510.6s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. That's so funny. The one of the chest said what the f*** is that chatter talking [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4515.240000000001s)]
*  about a politician literally sleeping with someone led to the second ever presidential [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4519.64s)]
*  impeachment is like no that chatter was there being like, mmm, sweetie, I don't like that you're [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4524.4400000000005s)]

*  He said I think what she said about Kamala Harris and the White House is a borant, but he said it's [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4536.360000000001s)]
*  deeper than that. He said she says some things about Republicans too. And she says he went on [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4541.96s)]
*  to say about Trump. He would serve himself well to make sure that she doesn't become [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4546.12s)]
*  a bigger story. So a clear concerns among some of Trump's closest allies that he's getting too [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4550.28s)]
*  close to her and that he needs to show some distance guys. Interesting. Are we legit reporting [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4556.28s)]
*  on whether Trump has sex with Laura Loomer during his campaign tour? I mean, honestly, if you ask me [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4562.5199999999995s)]
*  in all sincerity, I don't think so. Okay. But having said that it is very funny to endlessly [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4568.12s)]
*  speculate. But if I'm being fully real, like, no, I don't think Trump, Laura Loomer get out of here. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4576.44s)]
*  But do I think it's a phenomenal story to cover? Yes. Manu and that Marjorie Taylor Green is drawing [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4581.16s)]
*  a line at what acceptable rhetoric is. And it appears to be Jewish space lasers, but not this. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4587.72s)]

*  theories. Even the conspiracy theory we heard on the debate stage on Tuesday night from Donald Trump [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4674.44s)]

*  he took the stage. And I'm wondering since you brought up what he said on the debate stage about [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4702.44s)]
*  Haitian immigrants in Ohio eating pets, how do conspiracy theories like that of that ilk originate? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4707.8s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Green screaming from the rooftops about Laura Loomer being in Trump's orbit [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4715.72s)]

*  you doing? You're giving the game away. You're being like far too open about your actual allegiances [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4736.280000000001s)]
*  and associating yourself and others with like a truly toxic individual. Like we agree with the [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4742.6s)]

*  situation. Don't say the quiet part out loud. You're giving the game away. And which ones [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4755.799999999999s)]
*  are seemingly amplified more than others on social media and interviews and obviously on the debate [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4762.36s)]
*  stage. It seems like the media talking about this is needlessly elevating this. No, it's a incredibly [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4767.5599999999995s)]
*  valid avenue of attack against Donald Trump. I'm just more so upset about the way that the media [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4773.16s)]
*  is covering it by like not really talking about how insane Laura Loomer is, like barely covering, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4778.44s)]
*  barely scratching the surface. Okay, which has a ton. I mean, Laura Loomer is a target rich [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4786.04s)]
*  environment. Like in this circumstance, you have to talk about like how insane she is and then [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4790.919999999999s)]
*  immediately immediately turn it into and here's why he's saying, you know, Haitians are eating pets. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4795.639999999999s)]
*  Now, of course, they are kind of doing that. I like this guy. He's one of the best that CNN has, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4802.5199999999995s)]
*  in my opinion. He kind of did do that. She's actually kind of popping off a little bit too. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4806.92s)]
*  So I don't really have an issue with this kind of coverage overall. I do hate it whenever they [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4812.12s)]
*  talk about, I do hate it whenever they, what? If your 70 year old, 78 year old grandpa called [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4817.96s)]
*  his new girlfriend a free spirit, you change all his passwords. That's a good take. A lot of the [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4824.2s)]
*  time it starts out with fringe figures online, increasingly more popular mainstream bar right. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4829.24s)]
*  The jean jacket is I think acne studios, influencers like Laura Luma, like Laura Lumer, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4835.48s)]
*  repeating these wild falsehoods that kind of trickle their way up through the system, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4841.16s)]
*  coming eventually out of the potential future president of the United States mouth. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4845.24s)]
*  And there's real offline harm to these online conspiracy theories. Just today we saw there. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4849.24s)]
*  Yeah. God forbid, God forbid you'd have a God forbid we have a president who says like unhinged, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4855.32s)]
*  unsubstantiated things like that. He's seen dead children who are beheaded by Palestinian [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4861.64s)]
*  resistance fighters who then light them on fire with kerosene. God forbid that would be, well, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4869.08s)]
*  yeah, no, that would be actually really damaging to discourse. Wouldn't it? Now, of course, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhvsmineZTI&t=4875.64s)]
