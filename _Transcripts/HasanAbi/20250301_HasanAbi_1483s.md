*  My man was on like brawny stat line like fucking two threes that he made successfully for on like 11 attempts or something [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=584.94s)]
*  It was crazy like it was it was a it was a wild he has a wild shot percentage is all I'm going to say [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=594.94s)]
*  He still popped off. Obviously. I mean he like dropped what 30 something like that. So I mean he's still he's still incredible [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=602.94s)]
*  He had a lot of turnovers as well. I don't know what was going on but he's been off from three since he's gotten the Lakers until he made it to in the row [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=612.94s)]
*  Yeah, no the two threes in a row was was incredible calm down. Braum was two seven on threes last night. Okay, listen [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=619.94s)]
*  That's okay. Literally all I saw from that game was Luffy. Yeah, it was sick. Um, you honestly don't know ball. Wait, what? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=627.94s)]
*  Dude, I'm a Clipper fan stop and move on terrible defender. Yeah, I was actually going to talk about that part of it as well [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=637.94s)]
*  I think that's also kind of funny but Luca does the classic like he does the classic like lazy defender who has really good hands [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=645.94s)]
*  That's the other thing that he does where he's just like straight up you if you've ever played basketball [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=655.94s)]
*  You've encountered a guy who will let you pass them and then hook you from behind. Okay, and like push the ball out of your hand [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=661.94s)]
*  Okay. Now it's ironic because he's doing that to James Harden who was also like that, you know, who also does that as well [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=669.94s)]
*  But he got he got one charge that was called on him as a foul that was bullshit. Okay. And and I mean he got five fouls by the by the fourth quarter [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=679.94s)]
*  He gets a lot of fouls because he defends like that, you know, does the song play basketball? He does his best. Excuse me. I ball I ball freaking super hard [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=694.94s)]
*  But this chatter is just coping because the because the fraudulent Clippers got absolutely eviscerated by Lake Nation by my goat LeBron [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=706.94s)]
*  So it is kind of wild though the the Lakers lineup is wild considering that it's just like the most it's insanely top-heavy like it's crazy [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=716.94s)]
*  You know in a game where there's like a hundred plus points is like sixty points coming from two dudes is wild but and they almost lost because the refs are the refs just kept helping the Clippers [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=727.94s)]
*  Crooked Clippers the referees were on their side. They need new glasses in Turkey. We have a saying hakeme gözlük eline de sözlük [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=739.94s)]
*  It means give the referee glasses and give him a dictionary like give it put it put a dictionary in his hand and give him glasses [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=749.94s)]
*  Okay, and that's what I kept saying I also kept yelling that James Harden was fat and he should get on Ozempic thinking maybe that he could hear me but I don't think he heard me [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=760.94s)]
*  Yeah, I was Laker'd up. I totally am a I don't really care. Ultimately. I don't really care about anything in terms of basketball James Harden is like 10 threes. He missed a he also he also missed a layup to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=770.94s)]
*  Lakers fan complaining about refs cannot survive as a fan in his community. Let me fail. No, that's a joke. I was not course side. I was close though. I was like rope 11 [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=787.94s)]
*  The refs hate Luca. Yeah, they do. Actually, that's not even that's not even fully fair because like they did give him a lot of calls [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=798.94s)]
*  I mean he did get fouled a lot, but they gave him a lot of calls when he was when he was going in [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=806.94s)]
*  You know, he got a lot of foul calls on off on offense but but refs hate Giannis everyone else gets indifference [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=811.94s)]
*  But what else what else what else? Yeah, we you see any celebs of the game last night? Yeah, there's Ludwig Oggren. I saw him. He was there and pokey main. Yeah, those are the only celebrities I saw [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_314f_57vU&t=821.94s)]
