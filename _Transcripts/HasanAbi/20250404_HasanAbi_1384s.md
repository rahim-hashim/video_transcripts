# This Is Organized Hatred | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y)
*  The notion that a consistently dominated ethnic minority that is relegated to the black market for survival is not going to engage in criminal actions or even engage in violent criminal actions is idiotic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  You are wrong. Okay. There are gangs of every racial minority and every and of course the racial majority as well. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=13.4s)]
*  This doesn't mean. Oh, we're also going to do the the the catnip for racist right wingers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=24.5s)]
*  This story as well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=38.3s)]
*  Because accounts I'm pretty sure accounts that have that have portrayed themselves as black people on black Twitter but are ultimately blue checkmark power farmers are now also participating in the racial adjupt prop which I find to be insane. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=42.5s)]
*  But God damn like that's how desperate you are for and ten dollars of Twitter revenue. Very cool. Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=65.5s)]
*  Now fear bug was discovered as a white nerd a while ago. Yeah. Dudes who substitute the N word for in all of their tweets. Yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=74.5s)]
*  The slot posters have pivoted to money's drying up I guess. So the slot poster pivoted to full tilt. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=81.5s)]
*  White supremacist shit and we're going to cover that story in a second because Republicans have gone crazy over it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=89.5s)]
*  The mold man suffered it was going turbo racist over this. Yeah I will I will explain it all. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=96.5s)]
*  But the moral depravity doesn't end there. Let's get back to domestic affairs twin brother speaks out after witnessing his brother get and die in his arms. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=102.5s)]
*  Austin Metcalf a four pointer student was attacked after telling a teen he was sitting on the wrong spot. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=112.5s)]
*  Carmelo Anthony was later arrested and charged with first degree. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=116.5s)]
*  This is the story. The reason why I'm talking about the story is because the reason why I am talking about the story is because the right wing is desperately looking for anything to shift their attention away from Donald Trump undermining the global [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=121.5s)]
*  economy and global trade and destroying their 401 case and get back to good old days where they could participate in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=140.5s)]
*  And by that I mean like like there is a real we have officially entered Klansman territory once again we've never really left Matt wash openly just says the quiet part out loud here with a tweet that when I clocked it had one hundred and one thousand likes I'm going to read you the tweet. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=151.5s)]
*  I'm going to read you a first I'm going to read you what Matt was said then we'll get to the details of the situation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=169.5s)]
*  If I told you that a young man another young man to death for telling him that he was in the wrong seat and then I told you that one young man in this altercation was white and the other black and then I asked you to guess the race of the assailant. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=175.5s)]
*  Every single person would know the answer immediately. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=187.5s)]
*  Yeah maybe every single person you know because that's the assumption that your racist ass is making and all of your other racist friends are making. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=191.5s)]
*  Why are you volunteering this information you're just this is basically someone unashamedly saying I'm massive white supremacist. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=200.5s)]
*  Okay now let's continue young black males are violent to a wildly outrageously disproportionate degree. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=208.5s)]
*  That's just a fact. We all know it and it's time that we speak honestly about it or nothing will ever change. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=215.5s)]
*  That's this is one to one Klansman shit. Okay. This is KKK is a clue Clucks clan territory. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=221.5s)]
*  I need you to understand like he is just straightforwardly going young black man. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=230.5s)]
*  I mean he said it I don't know what else to say he's just saying young black males are vulnerable wildly outrageously disproportionate degree. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=236.5s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=242.5s)]
*  Now that's not a quote unquote fact. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=244.5s)]
*  That's not how any of this works but this is the Twitter equivalent of burning across and demanding that a lynching takes place. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=248.5s)]
*  I think it's important to take note of this because of the fact that 101,000 people liked it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=258.5s)]
*  Bring a knife and you're going to get first bullied or not. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=267.5s)]
*  I mean my 401k survived and so did my parents the drought was from the ultra rich looking to buy more no statistically blacks commit more violent crime the minority doesn't mean all but the stats are there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=270.5s)]
*  L take okay time is not dictated by someone's race. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=281.5s)]
*  If you think someone's race is an indication of their proclivity to do crime then you're a racist. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=286.5s)]
*  It's that's it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=296.5s)]
*  You can be ashamed of being a racist person or you can potentially re-examine why you feel this way and stop feeling this way because that's just your feelings is not determined by race. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=298.5s)]
*  Crime is determined by your finances by your financial status by your material conditions the likelihood the proclivity towards violent crime. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=314.5s)]
*  The greatest indicator for a proclivity towards violent crime does not come from your race it simply comes from your material circumstances. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=325.5s)]
*  Okay for white people have a higher rate of crime than rich white people do just like poor black people have a higher crime rate or a higher proclivity towards doing crime then rich black people do. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=334.5s)]
*  I hope that is clear. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=351.5s)]
*  Having said that it seems like this story is not simply about the way that everyone is responding to it where he's like Austin Menke was a 4.0 student. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=353.5s)]
*  Not to say that his twin brother is not a victim in this circumstance because of course he is he died. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=364.5s)]
*  Okay he was he died. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=371.5s)]
*  So let's first start off here and then let's hear about the additional details that surround the incident. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=372.5s)]
*  There was this kid before I knew his name now this kid was sitting under our dark tent at track we asked him to move he started getting aggressive and talking reckless. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=381.5s)]
*  I'm sorry but Asians were super poor as well and you almost never see them killing anyone even in the past. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=395.5s)]
*  So I'm sorry to say race education matters six most subscriber literally saying that there is racial disparity and it's not about finances. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=400.5s)]
*  No that's not true. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=410.5s)]
*  You're just wrong. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=412.5s)]
*  You're insanely racist and wrong. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=414.5s)]
*  That's just your opinion. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=416.5s)]
*  I hope you understand that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=418.5s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=419.5s)]
*  Asians are a race's favorite wedge. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=420.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=422.5s)]
*  Let's continue. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=423.5s)]
*  And my brother said that he said he's a move. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=424.5s)]
*  He's like make me move also grab this backpack. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=426.5s)]
*  This kid I try to look around as fast as I could but I didn't see the stab but then I was my mom. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=428.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=437.5s)]
*  Chatter never heard about the triads or any sort of like gang activity when people were forced in it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=438.5s)]
*  Dude my Asian parents come in Europe with zero euro in their pocket and no one of them ever commit any crimes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=443.5s)]
*  Okay dude the notion that a consistently dominated ethnic minority that is relegated to the black market for survival is not going to engage in criminal actions or even engage in violent criminal actions is idiotic. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=450.5s)]
*  You are wrong. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=464.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=465.5s)]
*  There are gangs of every racial minority and every and of course the racial majority as well. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=466.5s)]
*  This doesn't mean anything. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=475.5s)]
*  You have to examine how this happens why this happens and it's not because of their genetic predetermined destiny. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=477.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=485.5s)]
*  Unless you are a psychopath who believes in debunked race science in 2025. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=486.5s)]
*  This is an idiotic argument to make is just your own personal feelings talking about your parents. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=495.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=501.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=502.5s)]
*  Your parents didn't have money and they didn't do any sort of criminal acts. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=503.5s)]
*  That's great. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=507.5s)]
*  I love that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=508.5s)]
*  That's wonderful. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=509.5s)]
*  That's not what we're talking about here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=510.5s)]
*  We're talking about statistics. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=511.5s)]
*  Also your parents didn't commit any crimes seemingly but they still failed in raising a normal competent son. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=512.5s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=519.5s)]
*  So you're just saying social factors. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=521.5s)]
*  That's your explanation. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=523.5s)]
*  No man. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=524.5s)]
*  That's not just you can't just say social factors when talking about sociological predeterminations being made. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=525.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=534.5s)]
*  Just shortening it doesn't change it into something irrelevant. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=535.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=538.5s)]
*  Yes your material conditions are what dictates with the exception of anti-social personality disorder related crimes or like childhood trauma. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=539.5s)]
*  And even then you can point that back to your material circumstances. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=551.5s)]
*  The large majority if not damn near entirety of crimes out of poverty born out of your material circumstances. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=555.5s)]
*  And I'm not saying that you're you know going out and doing a rape because you were fucking poor and it's to get you out of your poverty. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=563.5s)]
*  That's not my argument. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=571.5s)]
*  My argument is that if you are born without any sort of social safety nets you're born into a single parent household no social safety nets no educational attainment opportunities no job opportunities. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=572.5s)]
*  You are more likely to do crimes. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=583.5s)]
*  And it does not matter what race you are. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=588.5s)]
*  This is why I very clearly said there is a higher higher likelihood for poor white people to do violent crimes than rich black people. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=593.5s)]
*  There is a higher likelihood for poor white people to do crimes than rich white people. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=604.5s)]
*  There is a higher likelihood for poor black people to do crimes than rich black people and rich white people. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=610.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=619.5s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=620.5s)]
*  And this isn't exactly reinventing the wheel. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=621.5s)]
*  This is something that this is something that I feel like people basically figured out when they figured out the invention of the wheel. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=624.5s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=638.5s)]
*  It's about culture. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=639.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=640.5s)]
*  We haven't had a you are just copium right now. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=641.5s)]
*  I'm sorry bro. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=644.5s)]
*  White male here. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=645.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=646.5s)]
*  I didn't realize I haven't had this conversation in quite a while or maybe it's because Asmongold is probably not doing politics anymore. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=647.5s)]
*  But this is insane. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=654.5s)]
*  No it is not about culture. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=656.5s)]
*  Black culture is the most consumed culture in the United States of America. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=658.5s)]
*  Are you saying that black culture which is more often than not consumed by white people just simply telegraphing violence to black people more than it is to white people or do you think there's a different set of circumstances here. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=664.5s)]
*  Oh yeah this guy got banned for saying playing the race card again begged to be unbanned sit then turned around and still fucking is trying. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=679.5s)]
*  Okay dude. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=687.5s)]
*  Fuck off. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=688.5s)]
*  Why didn't Jordan build a Palestinian state from 1948 to 1967 like trying to defend Israel in the silliest ways possible since you care so much about indigenous rights you support the rights of Greece to go back to Constantinople. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=690.5s)]
*  Yes I do. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=700.5s)]
*  Yeah they can voluntarily migrate into Turkey and become Turkish citizens in ways that the Palestinians cannot into Israel proper. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=702.5s)]
*  What's your fucking point. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=713.5s)]
*  That was my argument back then as well. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=714.5s)]
*  You dumb fuck. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=715.5s)]
*  Anyway where's that white male guy he needs some smoke to race this guy defending Israel by the way least shocking set of circumstances I've ever encountered. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=717.5s)]
*  Yes I think it's important to clarify to people that we're not just saying people commit crimes because they need money. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=726.5s)]
*  Yes I'm not saying that that's why I gave the example of like people don't do fucking rape because they're simply because they're poor and this is their way to make money. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=731.5s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=739.5s)]
*  I'm saying that the likelihood that you will do a violent crime skyrockets when your your material circumstances are dog shit and you have no social safety nets and you have no pathway for a better future. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=740.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=753.5s)]
*  They need money years of poverty and lack of proper resource can breed anti-social behaviors. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=754.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=759.5s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=760.5s)]
*  At the end of the day the culture argument is just a coward's way of making the race argument. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=761.5s)]
*  The culture argument is a coward's way of making the racial argument. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=767.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=770.5s)]
*  Everybody consumes black culture. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=771.5s)]
*  So what are you trying to say. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=773.5s)]
*  You think white people poor white people seemingly consume more black culture. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=775.5s)]
*  Is that what it is then rich white people. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=779.5s)]
*  Is that why that same dynamic exists or is it because of their financial circumstances. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=781.5s)]
*  Read my dog shit comment. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=787.5s)]
*  Anyway that's not the only problem here. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=789.5s)]
*  Yeah I hate the culture argument the cultural argument. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=792.5s)]
*  Black people have been consistently underserved systematically by the American government and people still go oh it's the culture. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=796.5s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=803.5s)]
*  What what is I don't know what you mean by that. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=804.5s)]
*  The rest of just that's that's what I saw. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=807.5s)]
*  I mean I try to I try to help them. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=811.5s)]
*  It was just senseless. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=815.5s)]
*  It was it was really senseless really. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=817.5s)]
*  I don't know why my person would do that to someone just over that little argument. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=819.5s)]
*  It's just it's just crazy in this world nowadays how people just up and do that like that. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=824.5s)]
*  A man of a family that man has people that care about them all the time and he did everything for our family too. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=829.5s)]
*  He was a strong man. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=834.5s)]
*  He was strong strong kid. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=835.5s)]
*  There was chat degrades when the nephews get home from school you're doing the village elders work us on. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=837.5s)]
*  It's important for me to teach the nephews not to be fucking racist because they haven't learned this lesson yet. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=843.5s)]
*  Beyond material inequality there's also the effect of over policing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=849.5s)]
*  Yes you're absolutely correct. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=852.5s)]
*  That has on crime statistics if you have 50 officers policing a neighborhood and compare that to a neighborhood with five police officers you would expect that the crime statistics in the first neighborhood to show higher crime without that actually being the case. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=853.5s)]
*  There's also a sentencing disparity amongst black people in comparison to white people white people and black people when in areas that have been that have measured this consume drugs at the same rate. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=863.5s)]
*  Black people are caught at a higher rate and also prosecuted with longer sentences for the same exact crimes as white people. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=874.5s)]
*  So all of this is an endless cycle of undermining black people in this country. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=881.5s)]
*  And instead of analyzing and pouring through all of this data the dumbest Republican you know will go that's just woke bullshit brother. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=887.5s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=895.5s)]
*  Yeah facts don't care about your feelings right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=896.5s)]
*  Except you know you're making a fee fees argument. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=898.5s)]
*  Your feelings tell you that this is the case. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=901.5s)]
*  Facts on the other hand explain a very different story. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=905.5s)]
*  Anyway this is a powder keg for race baiting bullshit for all the worst white supremacist monsters out there who are desperately looking for a story to to focus on. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=909.5s)]
*  Even if for the record this this teenagers black teenager unjustifiably one up and stabbed a white teenager if you extrapolate any additional information about the entirety of the black population you're just trying to justify your racist predetermination. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=922.5s)]
*  OK. You've already arrived at that conclusion before the story came out and you're just trying to make other people agree with you by pointing to the story. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=941.5s)]
*  White people white men in particular comprise 74 percent of convictions on the procurement and creation of child sexual abuse material and child pornography. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=951.5s)]
*  This does not mean that every white man is doing child pornography. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=964.5s)]
*  Nobody ever assumes that every white man is engaging in child pornography now chatters when I mention this will jokingly say I do. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=968.5s)]
*  But that's the difference right. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=975.5s)]
*  That's a joke because white men are the domineering force in American society at least throughout American history. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=977.5s)]
*  They are the in group. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=984.5s)]
*  They are the power group. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=985.5s)]
*  So making a joke at the expense of white men is like making a joke at the expense of straight people. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=986.5s)]
*  It's not the same as shitting on gay people. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=992.5s)]
*  That's the difference between gay pride and straight pride. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=995.5s)]
*  That's the difference between black pride and white pride. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=998.5s)]
*  Very difficult dynamic to explain to people who go well the Merriam Webster's definition for racism means you know any kind of discouragement or whatever against people by creed of by by you know the color of their skin. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1001.5s)]
*  So I got you. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1015.5s)]
*  It's like yeah OK. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1016.5s)]
*  You got me. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1017.5s)]
*  All right. Yes. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1018.5s)]
*  I'm not going to go into the details of the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1020.5s)]
*  Webster's definition is not as as as appropriate to use when we're making sociological determinations anyway touch me and see what happens. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1021.5s)]
*  New details of my surrounding Frisco track me stabbing in arrest affidavit the suspect reportedly told the officer arrested them the 17 year old victim put his hands on him and that he admitted that I did it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1031.5s)]
*  It's revealing how Austin Metcalfe stabbed to death at a track meeting Frisco police say another teenager had fresh blood on his finger when they found him at Kirkendale Stadium. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1041.5s)]
*  The affidavit shows that when officers arrived Carmelo Anthony told them he got into an argument with Metcalfe and when the arresting officer said he had the alleged suspect in custody Anthony replied I'm not alleged. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1051.5s)]
*  I did it. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1063.5s)]
*  But Anthony told officers he only acted in self defense and asked them if Metcalfe was OK. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1064.5s)]
*  Several witnesses paint a different picture and Metcalfe's father told Matt Howerton he is not buying the excuse. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1070.5s)]
*  I had a dream last night. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1077.5s)]
*  And Austin came to me and said I'm OK. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1081.5s)]
*  It gives me peace doesn't mean I don't hurt the last 24 hours unimaginable for Austin Metcalfe's father his mother his twin brother right now I'm really numb and I really don't feel. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1087.5s)]
*  Anything I just have to function Metcalfe just 17 when he arrived at Frisco ISD district track meet Wednesday his final breaths taken before 11 a.m. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1099.5s)]
*  Police say after being stabbed to death by a fellow Frisco ISD student 17 year old Carmelo Anthony now charged with first degree murder. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1109.5s)]
*  My world is a little shattered. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1118.5s)]
*  An argument over where Anthony was sitting while the meat experienced a rain delay sparked a confrontation between the teen and Metcalfe according to arrest paperwork Anthony sitting underneath Metcalfe's team tent. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1121.5s)]
*  You could see it from the air when we flew over the crime scene Metcalfe from Memorial High Anthony from Centennial a witness telling police Metcalfe told Anthony to move from under the team's tent because he didn't go to their school. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1132.5s)]
*  The witness telling police Anthony grabbed his bag opened it and reached inside and proceeded to tell Austin touch me and see what happens. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1145.5s)]
*  Investigators writing that Metcalfe grabbed Anthony to tell him to move and that Anthony pulled out a black knife and stabbed Austin once in the chest and then ran away when officers arrived the knife was found and police say Anthony admitted to what happened but said this to police. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1153.5s)]
*  He put his hands on me I was protecting myself even asking another officer if what happened could be considered self defense. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1168.5s)]
*  What do you expect if you're caught the best thing you do is try to lie your way out of it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1177.5s)]
*  Metcalfe's father telling me self defense is not a reasonable excuse. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1182.5s)]
*  The truth will come out there were too many people that were there that saw what happened. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1187.5s)]
*  Father came out on Fox and a later interview on Fox saying this shouldn't be politicized and it's a human issue not a racial or political one. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1194.5s)]
*  I know it's too late though because everyone is using this this horrible situation like this horrifying situation as a as an opportunity to race bait and to relitigate a race war. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1200.5s)]
*  No it's not too late is first of all it's okay for him to mourn chatters the fuck are you talking about his kid got stabbed to death at school the fuck do you mean I think it's it's it's shocking that he is not leaning into the 14 words narratives to be fair especially from like I assume a predominantly white town you know what I mean. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1216.5s)]
*  Yeah and guess what he did that and now people on fucking Twitter are calling him a cuck. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1237.5s)]
*  That people say there was it's very unfortunate that this other child decided to make a bad choice that's going to affect him for the rest of his life. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1245.5s)]
*  I have compassion for every human being this is not I want to make this very clear this is not a race issue this is not a black and white issue I don't want someone stepping up on a soapbox trying to politicize this I don't appreciate some of the remarks I've seen online that people say there was this fight and there was they don't know they weren't there. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1254.5s)]
*  It's very unfortunate that this other child decided anyway. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1275.5s)]
*  My own son told me in Frisco they also didn't put this in the news article for WFAA so that's cool. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1285.5s)]
*  But yeah would this even be news if they were both white it would still be local news but it wouldn't make it into the national stage. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1295.5s)]
*  That's for sure. And before people say like role reversal we know what the role reversal looks like. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1303.5s)]
*  Okay the role refer the role reversal is Daniel Penny exonerated and becomes a conservative hero and also on top of that exonerated becomes a conservative hero gets a fucking job at like Andre's and Horowitz. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1309.5s)]
*  So we know we know what the difference is we know what the role reversal looks like. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1326.5s)]
*  Okay when a white person kills a black person regardless of what either party has engaged in. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1331.5s)]
*  So just so you understand stand your ground does not work for black people. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1340.5s)]
*  Every black person knows this. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1345.5s)]
*  There's no stand your ground if you're black stand your ground is if you are a black victim of a white assailant. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1347.5s)]
*  Yeah in any case yeah that's the that's the situation. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1354.5s)]
*  Anyone that tries to extrapolate like racial dynamics out of this or make you know grand arguments about how all black people are this way is a fucking racist. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1359.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8S95saJ8Y&t=1377.5s)]
