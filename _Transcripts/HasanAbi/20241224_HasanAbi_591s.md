# Holiday-Related Issues | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco)
*  I don't know. I mean, there are plenty of disagreements that I have politically. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=0.0s)]
*  I think I would have politically with my family members if I were to bring it up. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=3.36s)]
*  I just don't, you know, am I wrong? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=7.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  I think you're not in a good position to answer this because there are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  contingent families out there and there is family. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=16.12s)]
*  Is the season for spending time? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=24.2s)]
*  Is the season for spending time with those you may not always? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=25.88s)]
*  Why half of Americans expect conflict, the holiday gatherings and how to handle it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=28.88s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=32.32s)]
*  This is so stupid. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=34.16s)]
*  Is agree with there's a new survey that finds that nearly half of Americans [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=35.44s)]
*  expect heated discussions at holiday gatherings. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=39.04s)]
*  This is like every single holiday season as Jake, as Jake takes on more confusing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=42.04s)]
*  positions, I become a part of the 48% when previously I never thought I would be. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=50.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=57.04s)]
*  This year. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, it found a few hot button issues that are sure to fire things up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  In third place, religion. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=64.2s)]
*  Never talk about coming in second. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=67.2s)]
*  Family issues like parenting and finances. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=70.0s)]
*  And in first place, not surprisingly, the survey found that the most controversial [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=73.44s)]
*  topic is politics. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=77.92s)]
*  All this has one in two people planning to avoid holiday gatherings altogether. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=80.4s)]
*  That's because more than 30% of people say they don't think it's possible to have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=86.08s)]
*  productive conversations about different views without conflict. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=89.92s)]
*  So how do we navigate all of this? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=93.44s)]
*  How do we agree to disagree? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=95.2s)]
*  Well, Dan Lyons joins us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=97.04s)]
*  He is the bestselling author. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=98.6s)]
*  Being in news is a family reunions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=99.84s)]
*  Yeah, except my family is in agreement with me for the most part. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=101.64s)]
*  Like there are obviously disagreements that we have, but they're not like large enough [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=105.84s)]
*  or significant enough to fight over. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Cenk is the outlier in this situation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=113.28s)]
*  Ironically enough, he is literally the outlier. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=116.52s)]
*  Yeah, we have a family of Max leftists. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=119.56s)]
*  Yeah, shaky Gerga has become the black sheep of the family in this regard. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=122.04s)]
*  Author of the book, the power of keeping your mouth shut in an endlessly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=126.76s)]
*  And I do think that I'm in a unique predicament because like, I'm a political [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=130.8s)]
*  commentator and so is my uncle. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=134.4s)]
*  Like if if we just had like regular conservatives or whatever, conservative [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=136.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=141.72s)]
*  Like Jake collaborating with Charlie Kirk is very different than like you talking, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=142.72s)]
*  talking shop or talking about football with your conservative coworkers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=148.24s)]
*  You know, that's something that I need to explain quite frequently, which is that, you [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=154.44s)]
*  know, one of the most significant principles that I routinely repeat is be normal and don't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=160.72s)]
*  be weird. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=167.12s)]
*  Don't be a weird loser. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=168.12s)]
*  So, yeah, be chill with your coworkers, even if they're conservative coworkers, even [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=170.4s)]
*  if they voted for Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  Like you can have like, you know, you can have normal conversations with them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  But I think when it becomes a professional political commentator, that's a little [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  different. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=182.4s)]
*  The world's such a great title. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=183.4s)]
*  He's also the editorial director of DocuSign. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Dan, good morning. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=187.68s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=188.84s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  So when we're with family and friends and things start to heat up, things start to get [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  a little awkward. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=195.64s)]
*  What, what should the person who's part and party to this conversation do to try to tan [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=196.64s)]
*  things down? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  So there are, there are techniques you can use, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  And DocuSign is interested in us because they're your dad's ex finance bro, though. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, yeah, but it doesn't matter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=209.55999999999997s)]
*  Like he doesn't, he doesn't give like American domestic politics. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  And for American foreign policy, we're somewhat aligned, not really, but it doesn't really [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=215.6s)]
*  matter. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=220.92s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=221.92s)]
*  He does not care about American domestic politics. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=223.0s)]
*  Like an agreement management company. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=225.88s)]
*  So this began as a project about agreement rather than disagreement. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=227.6s)]
*  How, how come some people are so good at agreeing with other people? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=230.6s)]
*  So I went off and I talked to like hostage negotiators, a marriage counselor, a kindergarten [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  teacher, really experts at agreement. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=238.88s)]
*  And what that is insane. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  What a, what a range, dude. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=244.56s)]
*  What a range. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  He said hostage negotiators to kindergarten teachers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  These are all experts at conflict management, crisis negotiation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=251.46s)]
*  One of the techniques you can use is just called thank you because it's three words. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  It's very easy to use. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=261.14s)]
*  You just bring this with you to this party, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=262.14s)]
*  Thank you means I express gratitude to you for sharing your opinion, whatever it is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=264.36s)]
*  I explained something I admire about your opinion. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=267.98s)]
*  Something I think is good. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=271.1s)]
*  But once I've done that now I can tell you what my opinion is, but because you know, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=272.1s)]
*  you know who agrees with this guy? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=277.02s)]
*  Who? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=278.62s)]
*  In regards to Charlie Kirk. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=280.02s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=281.58s)]
*  I've listened to you first. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=283.58s)]
*  You're more likely to listen to me in return and that is going to start bringing down the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=285.66s)]
*  temperature and also sort of, it's sort of like showing somebody risks when your family [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=289.42s)]
*  member calls you a slur. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank say thank you because dude, that's crazy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  Like does that, is that happening frequently? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=298.14s)]
*  Chatters. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=301.14s)]
*  God damn like that's a family member, dude. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=302.14s)]
*  That's just like, I think rock. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=305.54s)]
*  When you just like remove political ideology from the equation, that's just plain old rude. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  That's like an incredibly rude way to behave. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=314.85999999999996s)]
*  Sometimes fam is your biggest obs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=318.34s)]
*  Brother, there is no opinion my parents hold that I respect law and yes, families are omega [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=320.26s)]
*  sh**. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=323.9s)]
*  How do you stay normal if your entire family is anti normal to you? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=324.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, there are plenty of disagreements that I have politically. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  I think I would have politically with my family members if I were to bring it up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  I just don't, you know, am I wrong? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=335.53999999999996s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=337.86s)]
*  I think you're not in a good position to answer this because there are contiguous families [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=338.86s)]
*  out there and there's families that are have a hard time having those discussions where [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=344.58000000000004s)]
*  they can voice their true, you know, political leanings or whatever. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=350.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=354.82s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not saying that anybody's a victim or anything, but it's difficult to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=355.82s)]
*  for us to relate to that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=361.82s)]
*  And in like a very true sense, my uncle talking about deporting people and joking about pro [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  choice cat ladies, me, thank you for sharing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=367.82s)]
*  Thank you for sharing that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=370.34s)]
*  No, I mean, like you can, you can avoid the topic, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=371.34s)]
*  You can. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=373.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=374.98s)]
*  I wouldn't say hide where you stand. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=375.98s)]
*  That's what I, that's what I would do in that situation. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=378.26s)]
*  Like I would just never, I would steer every conversation directly away from a political [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=380.9s)]
*  like that because that way you win the rest of the room where they're the annoying person [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=387.74s)]
*  that's like constantly making everything political. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=395.02s)]
*  Yeah. But I'm not I'm saying like, don't just agree with everything. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=397.5s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't listen to this doc. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=400.21999999999997s)]

*  Look, people, when I do collaborations with other content creators that are not political [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=408.18s)]
*  content creators and they ask me like a political question, what do I say? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=413.62s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I don't want to talk about politics. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=417.85999999999996s)]

*  You can make them look silly by just being like, dude, why are you talking about politics? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=424.02s)]
*  Thanks for teaching chatters, being normal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=428.86s)]
*  It's important. It's a it's a weapon. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=430.66s)]
*  The problem is they keep bringing it up. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=432.78s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=434.3s)]
*  That's the funniest part about it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=435.3s)]
*  Man on the left, think of the five to one, give the subs. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=436.82s)]
*  The funniest part about it is that like for the longest time, Trump supporters behaved [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=438.74s)]
*  as though they were the silent majority. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=444.42s)]
*  They still claim when they were always the can't, the can't shut the minority like they [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=447.98s)]
*  just can't shut the fuck up. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=453.1s)]
*  Nowadays, I feel like they've become even more galvanized. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=454.98s)]
*  They've become more emboldened. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=458.82000000000005s)]
*  So they just never shut up. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=460.86s)]
*  They love talking about how the rest of the family doesn't understand me because, you [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=463.26000000000005s)]

*  I voted for the great white hope. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=471.42s)]
*  And it's like, it's just like, dude, OK, you voted for Trump, man. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  You got it. You know, we'll see what happens. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=478.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't think that it's going to be good for you. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=480.70000000000005s)]
*  And I don't think it's going to be good for anybody else. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=482.5s)]
*  But like, can we just not have a political discussion for once in our entire in this [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=485.1s)]
*  entire goddamn holiday season? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=492.62s)]
*  Like, just shut up because I have noticed that like Trump supporters nowadays, especially [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=494.74s)]
*  are like very excited to have those conversations. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=499.82000000000005s)]
*  They are very excited where their their entire goal is to be like, yeah, yeah, we got it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=502.62s)]
*  Oh, my guy won. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=510.34s)]
*  OK, man, I heard that there's an echo. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=513.38s)]
*  There's an echo. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=515.4599999999999s)]
*  I know I turned it off. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=516.3s)]
*  I turned off Marat's microphone. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=517.54s)]
*  OK, shut up. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=519.02s)]
*  No, I already silenced you so they can't hear you, which is what you want to begin with. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=521.78s)]
*  So you also talk about this tactic of mirroring. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=526.42s)]
*  What is mirroring? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=529.5s)]
*  Mirroring is literally starting your sentence, saying a few of the words of your last few [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=530.66s)]
*  words. So you say something to me and I start by saying, oh, rough. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  Day. You know, you're saying, oh, I had a really rough day and I literally just say, oh, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=540.26s)]
*  rough day. And that actually keeps you talking. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  So mirroring is a way of me showing you, look, I'm listening to you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=546.86s)]
*  I'm actually hearing what you say and I understand you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  So you're also building empathy. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=553.14s)]
*  A lot of these agreement tricks. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=554.7s)]
*  Yeah, bro, this is so. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=556.94s)]
*  What are you saying, dad? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=559.4200000000001s)]
*  I opened the door. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=560.58s)]
*  I opened it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=562.02s)]
*  I'll roll back to empathy. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=562.58s)]
*  Just showing someone. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=564.0600000000001s)]
*  Hey, I understand how you see the world. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=565.22s)]
*  And I understand. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=567.62s)]
*  This is for literal babies. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=568.14s)]
*  Yeah, this is this is for literal babies. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=569.14s)]
*  That's why kindergarten teachers are what he heard from there. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=570.62s)]
*  Wait, this video is only one point six K views from one day ago and only one comment. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=576.3s)]
*  And it just says, don't serve alcohol. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=580.38s)]
*  This is such a funny video. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=583.74s)]
*  I'm skipping the rest of this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PlTK8Q7sco&t=585.14s)]
