# The U.S. Government Suppresses Anti-Israel Protests | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k)
*  Yeah, I wonder what's making American Jews feel less safe. Is it Elon Musk throwing up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=0.0s)]
*  a sig-heil? Or is it their sons and daughters who are also Jewish at college campuses protesting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=5.72s)]
*  against a foreign state? Much to consider here. I'm sure there are plenty of older American [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=12.38s)]
*  Jews who will say college campus protests are significantly more dangerous or whatever. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=19.46s)]
*  I'm sure. But the reality is obviously very different. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=23.84s)]
*  In response to those anti-Israel protests on college campuses, the Justice Department [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=35.44s)]
*  announcing the formation of a multi-agency task force aimed to combat anti-Semitism in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=40.72s)]
*  the U.S. My next guest says this is the quote, first step in giving life to President Trump's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=46.72s)]
*  renewed commitment to ending anti-Semitism in our schools. Senior counsel to the assistant [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=52.96s)]
*  attorney. Yeah, that's what Trump is doing. Mr. Push the push BB seat into his table. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=59.2s)]
*  You know, uncle of a friend got released. I have 23 years today. I guess I'm sure warm [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=66.4s)]
*  as soon as he left a general of the civil rights division, Leo Terrell joins me now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=69.8s)]
*  And Leo, I believe this is your first television interview since leaving Fox news. We are so [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=75.32s)]
*  It's so crazy that the first time around when all of the Trump supporters were like openly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=81.22s)]
*  neo-Nazis saying some of the most unhinged anti-Semitic shit, this administration defended [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=88.46s)]
*  them and they still to this day obviously don't care about racism. They don't care about [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=95.1s)]
*  general, but they do care about anti-Israel people. Like how many open Nazi, how many [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=101.64s)]
*  open Nazis were invited to college campuses? How many times have Klansmen and open neo-Nazis [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=111.2s)]
*  defended Donald Trump openly protested without fear of any sort of the Trump administration [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=119.2s)]
*  gotten protected by the Trump administration. These people do not care about anti-Semitism. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=125.12s)]
*  They only care about anti-Israel sentiment. Okay. That's it. Free speech, dude. Yeah, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=131.36s)]
*  exactly. Free speech, dude. That's right. Free speech, brother. Free speech. No speech [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=140.0s)]
*  when it comes to hurting big bad Israel's feelings though. Elon Musk throws up a sick [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=147.12s)]
*  high. A fat sick high, but he's pro-Israel. So it's all right. You could be a Jewish [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=153.36s)]
*  campus protester against Israel. That's the most anti-Semitic thing I've ever seen. You need to go [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=160.32s)]
*  to prison right now. And it's crazy because your parents kind of agree with this shit too, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=165.28s)]
*  most likely. They have no way of comprehending this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=172.32s)]
*  Jay, happy on the program today. Thanks for coming. Well, thank you very much. And I left [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=177.12s)]
*  the great company Fox news and for a job from the greatest, in my opinion, in my lifetime, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=181.12s)]
*  the greatest president to give me a chance to serve this country. And I'm working for a great [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=187.68s)]
*  attorney general, Pam Bondi, in basically eliminating this dual system of justice [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=192.32s)]
*  and providing justice in this country again. So Leo, tell us about this task force, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=199.12s)]
*  which is coordinated under the auspices of the DOJ's civil rights division. What's the goal here? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=205.36s)]
*  Very simple, Anita. And thank you for that question. First of all, everyone in this country [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=212.24s)]
*  saw what happened the last three or four years. Jewish Americans were ignored by the federal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=216.32s)]
*  government, ignored by local officials. Jewish American students couldn't go to school without [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=220.24s)]
*  being harassed. It happened across this country. Pam Bondi has created a task force to combat [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=224.96s)]
*  anti-Semitism. And I'm privileged to have to head that task force. What that means, Anita, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=232.24s)]
*  is that we're going to use every tool in the toolbox, civil criminal activities to stop the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=238.72s)]
*  harassment of Jewish students. We're going to cut off funding. We're going to do everything. And [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=244.72s)]
*  we're formulating that right now. Yeah. To your point, we all remember what we saw on college [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=249.28s)]
*  campuses across the country from Columbia University to UCLA. I believe we have the video [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=255.28s)]
*  where Jewish students were literally barred from going to class by pro-Palestinian protesters, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=260.8s)]
*  in some cases pro-Hamas protesters. No one, there you go. Look at that. No one seemed to be doing [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=268.32s)]
*  anything about it. And we heard very little from the last administration on why this was so wrong. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=274.8s)]
*  So how is this going to change now? Well, you heard crickets from the last administration. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=281.84s)]
*  And in those protests, I was embarrassed to see my law school, UCLA, allow this type of harassment [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=286.32s)]
*  going on. And Columbia University, how it's going to stop is very simple. We're going to cut off [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=292.88s)]
*  their funding. We're going to take criminal activity against those protesters. We're going [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=297.36s)]
*  to alert these blue cities that allow this. You have to get actively involved. This is the mission [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=302.32s)]
*  that Pam Bondi have given me to proceed with. And we have the education department, Anita, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=308.0s)]
*  health and human services involved. This is a joint task force to stop this. And I would tell [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=313.44s)]
*  the Jewish community, help is on the way because Pam Bondi wants to make sure everyone is treated [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=319.6s)]
*  fairly in this new Department of Justice. And that's what we're going to accomplish. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=325.44s)]
*  Yeah. The Jewish community is still very concerned about the way Jewish students, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=329.76s)]
*  Jewish people in general have been treated in this country over the last year. I want to bring your [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=334.24s)]
*  attention and put up on the screen some statistics from a brand new stuff. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=339.76s)]
*  Dude, no free speech. We are making protests illegal. We're making protests illegal. They [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=344.0s)]
*  literally sent cops. By the way, when this guy says, Oh, the Biden administration didn't prosecute [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=352.8s)]
*  these people like 3,100 arrests, more arrests on college campuses of students than, than arrests [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=358.08s)]
*  at January 6th. I want someone to love me as much as America loves Israel. You'll never find that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=366.4s)]
*  I hate to say it, but that kind of love does not exist. It's like loving your own arm. I [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  don't understand how nobody looks at this. It goes, Hey, maybe this is a little too far. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=378.96s)]
*  Hey, perhaps we should dial this back a thousand steps. Hey, perhaps maybe this is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=384.4s)]
*  completely unacceptable. Nope. It's great. All systems go baby. The guy who's leading the task [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=391.92s)]
*  force, a regular retweeter of the stop anti-Semitism account. Yeah, it's awesome. I'm going to jail. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  That's coming out. This is from the American Jewish committee. They're going to publish a study [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=403.44s)]
*  later this week. Here's some of it. This is the state of anti-Semitism in America. Look at this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=408.72s)]
*  90% of American Jews believe they say they believe anti-Semitism has increased since the October 7th [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  tragedy. 61% say anti-Semitism has increased a lot. And then look at this next statistic here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=423.76s)]
*  77% of American Jews, they feel less safe in the U S according to this study. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  Leah, when you look at these numbers, these are, these numbers are overwhelming that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=440.0s)]
*  I find them offensive. And I'll tell you right now, those numbers are supported, Anita, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=444.72s)]
*  by FBI numbers that I've seen. That October 7th massacre is the situation that prompted these [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=448.56s)]
*  increased numbers, but I can't stress it enough. This is going to stop immediately because the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=455.68s)]
*  department of justice, again, Pam Bondi have said everything we have to use to stop this [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=461.6s)]
*  and deter this conduct is going to happen. And it's going to happen now. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=467.28s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder what's making American Jews feel less safe. Is it Elon Musk throwing up a sick [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=471.44s)]
*  aisle or is it their sons and daughters who are also Jewish at college campuses protesting against [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  a foreign state much to consider here? I'm sure there are plenty of older American Jews who will [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=484.23999999999995s)]
*  say college campus protests are significantly more dangerous or whatever. I'm sure. But the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=491.92s)]
*  reality is, is obviously very different. People who protest against Israel are not threatening [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  your lives. Okay. People who are overtly and openly anti-Semitic and protesting against Israel [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=503.6s)]
*  is not anti-Semitic, but people who are overtly and openly anti-Semitic, those people are threatening [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=509.44s)]
*  you. And I told you right now that is a joint task force by all agencies in the government to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=516.8s)]
*  stop anti-Semitism. And Leo, while I have you here, I just want to ask you very quickly. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=523.5999999999999s)]
*  President Trump says he plans to create a White House faith office while directing attorney general [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=529.04s)]
*  Pam Bondi to lead a task force aimed to eliminate what he called anti-Christian bias within the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  federal government. In the last 20 seconds, what can you tell us about that? Let me tell you right [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=539.8399999999999s)]
*  now, everyone in this country knows the one, the greatest thing about this country is the fundamental [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=544.64s)]
*  right of free expression and free religion, freedom of religion. And what has happened the last three [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=548.8s)]
*  or four years, Christian and Catholic have- Yeah. That's why, that's why if you are a Muslim, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=553.36s)]
*  you can't be that way. Not allowed. Dude, people thinking that there's any sort of anti-Christian [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=560.4s)]
*  bigotry in this country are so delusional. Okay. I won't say the same, obviously about anti-Semitism, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=565.52s)]
*  but the notion that there is any sort of anti-Christian hatred being expressed [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=571.5999999999999s)]
*  in a way where there's like any sort of systematic oppression of Christians in this country, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=576.4s)]
*  they are out of their minds. Okay. You are quite literally the most insane person on the planet. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=581.52s)]
*  These guys think that like there's a war on Christmas happening. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  We are at the whims of people who are hallucinating an alternative reality. Oh my Lord. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=593.04s)]
*  Attacked by this government. We're going to stop it. And that's why president Trump [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=598.0s)]
*  tasked Pam Bondi to take care of it. I can assure you knowing Pam, we're going to box. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  The only, the irony here, of course, is that anti-Christian attacks are always done on the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=607.04s)]
*  basis of like, I can't be openly racist. Okay. In a, in a nation that is predominantly Christian, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  the only thing that these guys have as far as like anti-Christian hatred is that people have [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=621.04s)]
*  freedoms. Okay. That's it. And, and those freedoms are being denied as well. It's not like people [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=626.24s)]
*  still maintain those freedoms, like abortion, for example. All right. They literally think [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=633.04s)]
*  gay people existing in society is a direct attack against Christians. That's what they mean when [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=639.36s)]
*  they say anti-Christian hatred. That's what they're talking about. There's never any real [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=645.84s)]
*  anti-Christian hatred happening in this country. It's a Christian nation. Okay. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=651.28s)]
*  To address this bias against Christians, Catholics, all religions, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=656.72s)]
*  Anita, everyone should be treated fairly and equally. And that's one of the reasons why I'm [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=661.04s)]
*  proud to work in the department of justice. All right. Leo Turrell in his first appearance, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=664.8s)]
*  as he is in his new job with the department of justice and the civil rights division. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=670.96s)]
*  Leo, great to see you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Anita. Thanks for having me. You got it. Mike. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Mvbi3-m1k&t=674.88s)]
