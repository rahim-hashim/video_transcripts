**HasanAbi:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk)
*  This is my nephew Jason the Ween on a simulated date in the real world with another streamer, Kaede's little sister, Sakura. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=0.0s)]
*  They've had a tumultuous last 48 hours, okay? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=14.0s)]
*  Going from Jason inviting her to the streamer prom all the way to Sakura memeing too much in said streamer prom. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=22.0s)]
*  Wait, what the hell? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=36.0s)]
*  He's got 82,000 people watching him, dude. That's amazing. I'm so proud of him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=39.0s)]
*  Your nephew. Farm that shit. Farm the parasocials. W farm, W farm, W farm. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=45.0s)]
*  I really hope this doesn't turn sour. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=51.0s)]
*  Wait, she came back? She came back to him? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=58.0s)]
*  Wasn't she already in... [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=63.0s)]
*  Wasn't she already in... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=66.0s)]
*  Wasn't she in like... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=68.0s)]
*  Have you met Sakura? No. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=70.0s)]
*  I don't think I have. I might have at one of these events or something. I don't know her. I don't think I've ever met her. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=73.0s)]
*  She helped Judge Master Baker as a judge? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=81.0s)]
*  What is this? Are you 55? No. I am not 55. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=89.0s)]
*  Have you met Tenz? Yeah, of course I've met Tenz. I know Tenz well. Obviously I know Kaede very well. I just don't know Sakura. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=103.0s)]
*  It's like cheaper. Is it? Yes, in Japan it's cheaper. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=111.0s)]
*  Is Sakura the younger sister or the older sister of Kaede? I don't know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=114.0s)]
*  Younger. She's 20. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=123.0s)]
*  Wait, isn't Kaede also like 20? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=125.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=129.0s)]
*  Table for three. Who's Kaede? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=132.0s)]
*  Oh my god. I've cultivated a community that is so out of touch with the rest of this space. It's crazy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=134.0s)]
*  Are you moving it sideways? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=148.0s)]
*  Nice. Smart. Wow. Smart. Puller chair. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=151.0s)]
*  Respect. Respect. That's good. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=156.0s)]
*  W nephew. W. Dog, I'm 26 and watching this stuff makes me feel ancient. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=159.0s)]
*  It's okay to have a little fun in your life, dude. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=164.0s)]
*  It's because you're always live. When are we supposed to watch anything else? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=169.0s)]
*  Get off her phone, nephew. Talk to her. Ask her what she wants to order. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=173.0s)]
*  Talk about the... [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=179.0s)]
*  Talk about the delicacies that they serve here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=183.0s)]
*  I did my barbell, bro. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=189.0s)]
*  No, that was very sweet. I appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=191.0s)]
*  I was really tired. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=193.0s)]
*  Was it at night? When did they start going crazy? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=196.0s)]
*  When we were leaving. It was like three days. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=198.0s)]
*  Did you realize half of these kids wasn't even around when COVID was happening? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=200.0s)]
*  Dog, COVID happened. What? Five years ago. Okay, they're not six. They're not five years old. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=204.0s)]
*  Hassan lies about not watching Twitch on his off time. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=212.0s)]
*  No, I know everything that's going on on Twitch because I'm on TikTok all the time. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=215.0s)]
*  And their clips showed up on my TikTok. Their... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=219.0s)]
*  Nephew's clips are all up and down my timeline. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=223.0s)]
*  That's how I keep up with all the things that are happening on Twitch. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=228.0s)]
*  Not because I'm on... Not because I'm watching Twitch, but sometimes I do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=231.0s)]
*  No! [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=236.0s)]
*  Oh my God, I almost typed F. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=239.0s)]
*  Chad, I almost typed F. Is this how you guys feel? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=242.0s)]
*  Is this how you guys feel when you're watching me and you see a brief stutter? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=246.0s)]
*  Immediately, I wanted that something overcame me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=250.0s)]
*  Like there was a feeling. I was overcome with emotion. I had to inform my streamer. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=253.0s)]
*  I had to inform my streamer that there is an F that took place. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=258.0s)]
*  Hey, just wanted to let you know it's F-ing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=262.0s)]
*  What did you say when that one happened? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=265.0s)]
*  I just laughed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, but in real life it's crazy. I was like, oh... [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=270.0s)]
*  I laughed. I was like, I don't have a good workout. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah, when I was leaving VCT and tuning, we were like... [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=277.0s)]
*  Channing up time to check in, so I was just like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=280.0s)]
*  What'd they say? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=283.0s)]
*  Wait, did my internet have a brief stutter too? Or are you guys around? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=284.0s)]
*  There's babies out there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=288.0s)]
*  I was gonna ask off. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=294.0s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=295.0s)]
*  You think we want to wait for them to order, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=296.0s)]
*  I think so, yeah. Okay, so thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=298.0s)]
*  Wait, what do you want to get? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=300.0s)]
*  I'm thinking... [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=301.0s)]
*  You want to do lemongrass again? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=303.0s)]
*  Yeah, do you want to do lemongrass again? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah, what? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=306.0s)]
*  Lemongrass again. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=307.0s)]
*  I've never read or watched Rancid Girlfriend, but I imagine this is a very similar to the plot of that anime. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=308.0s)]
*  I don't know anything about that anime, so I can't speak on that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=312.0s)]
*  I do like pork butter. Now we can do chicken though. Chicken is more lean. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=315.0s)]
*  In real life, what is going on, man? Who are these people? Where are they? What? What happened to Iran? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=318.0s)]
*  Is it... Is Israel and Trump in war yet? What about Mamdani? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=323.0s)]
*  What about Mamdani? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=327.0s)]
*  What about Mamdani? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=329.0s)]
*  This is my nephew Jason the Ween on a simulated date in the real world with another streamer, Kaidei's little sister, Sakura. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=331.0s)]
*  They've had a tumultuous... They've had a tumultuous last 48 hours, okay? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=344.0s)]
*  Going from Jason inviting her to the streamer prom all the way to Sakura memeing too much in said streamer prom, Jason getting in his feelings, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=352.0s)]
*  and then feeling hurt by what she had said as a joke, and then the parasocial fans losing their minds and sending death threats to everybody involved, especially her. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=364.0s)]
*  Okay, so this is not a real date? No, the whole... It's basically interactive reality television. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=377.0s)]
*  Yo, I was scared. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=384.0s)]
*  It's interactive TV. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=389.0s)]
*  Damn, they're getting... [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=392.0s)]
*  I made that one before that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=394.0s)]
*  Damn, they're establishing physical contact. This is good. Oh my god, I'm so old. I'm old and I'm parasocial. What am I doing? What the fuck am I doing in my life? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=396.0s)]
*  This is... Oh my god, okay, I gotta stop. I gotta stop. This is embarrassing. This is an embarrassing thing to do online. This is like... This should be done privately when I'm sitting on my couch and seeing this in like little TikTok. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=403.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not right now, 33 and tapped in. That's right. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=427.0s)]
*  But look at this. This is what maybe I'm scared. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=433.0s)]
*  Okay, my little heart can't handle this. Oh my god. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=437.0s)]
*  Out of nowhere. I'll live. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=440.0s)]
*  Taste me. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=442.0s)]
*  I think this is like... You're giving me the ick right now, unc? Whatever. I don't care. You should have a little bit of... You should have a little bit of fanfare in your life, okay? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=443.0s)]
*  I have a child. Please get back to the news. I am too old for this shit. Watching this is giving me an existential crisis of how I'm continuing to age and rot away. Please go back to covering the impending war with Iran. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=453.0s)]
*  I mean, there is no war, dude. Trump is the peace president and you guys got duped into thinking that there was a war. That's right. I've forgotten all about it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=463.0s)]
*  I guess that's like the point, right? Like the point of this entire thing, the point of stuff like this and watching content like this is because it takes your attention away from the horrifying existence, the horrifying day to day existence, war with Iran, global instability, a ____ side unfolding every single day. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=471.0s)]
*  So people like watching cute things like this and then forget about all those other things. You know what I mean? If you did gear, your heart would be bigger and you could better handle this. The girly pops like this content too. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=493.0s)]
*  Because they're cute. Like look, they're sharing secrets from the chat, secrets away from the chat. Love it. They love it. Are they mudded? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=511.0s)]
*  So it's spectacle to quell the masses. Yes, dude. Jason, the weed is actually a federal operative that keep you servile. Spam W is on. Oh, I need to subscribe to write this record. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=529.0s)]
*  Wait, why can't I subscribe? Oh, here it is. Let's see if it worked or not. Okay, there you go. I hit the W. I hit the W in the chat. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=552.0s)]
*  Look at that. Is this how you guys feel? This is liberating, dude. This is like this is fun. I'm being a chatter today. I'm being a chatter. B2 Bombers moving in, but is Jakara going to move further beyond the friendship? Get in here. Yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=577.0s)]
*  Yeah. B2 Bombers are moving into Guam. But is Jakara going to move into the same house when they're in Japan? Find out more that type of shit. You know what I mean? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=595.0s)]
*  My bad, Chad. It's confidential. Y'all can't know. Confidential, y'all. This feels like when I was in high school and everyone at my table were friends but me. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=614.0s)]
*  Jakara is not home. Live-streaming content is the side of the oppressed creatures. I think for me, the best possible way of consuming this is still in the TikTok clip format. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=633.0s)]
*  Could you imagine how this chat would react if Austin were to bring back Rochler and you were on it again? I think they would kill me and Austin. I think like a 37 year old mom of three would get a gun and shoot both me and Austin because I took away from their morning news time. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=656.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy to think like, but I used to do this. Like I used to do not this content, but like I used to do a broad variety of different things. Like it wasn't off news all the goddamn time. You know what I mean? Unc, let him know he's doing well, gang. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=677.0s)]
*  He's doing great. What do you mean? She likes being around his presence. He's polite. He pulled, he pulled her chair. Those are all great. They're close. They're sitting close to one another. They're whispering into each other's ears. These are all good things. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=697.0s)]
*  I do as an old man still worry that this is, I hope that, you know, this doesn't turn sour because it is far too popular and it's a little scary how much people like it. And when people really respond positively to this kind of stuff, they read too far into things when people are making jokes and what not. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=714.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Sir, listen to yourself. She likes his presence. He pulled her out her chair for her. Get a grip. So this is all fake for what? Exactly. This is watching. This is you watching the children. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=737.0s)]
*  Enjoy the piece you wish to create for everyone. Yes. What's their ship name? Jocker. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=754.0s)]
*  What's up, bro? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=773.0s)]
*  There's like, there's multitudes. This contains multitudes. I don't know what that means. See, I'm not as tapped in. What did he, I don't know what he said. L Lacey is what people are saying, but I don't know. Hell no. Lacey. Lacey DMS just blown up right now. L Lacey. Why is it L Lacey? L Lacey Shizuku is his London home. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=794.0s)]
*  This is like no pixel. IRL. She doesn't potentially be explosive. WK song. None of these words are in the Bible. Yeah. But she was like, wait for red to get bad. Yesterday we were talking about how you don't laugh and just realize a large part of it is the fact that you're not. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00n2Co8llk&t=824.0s)]
