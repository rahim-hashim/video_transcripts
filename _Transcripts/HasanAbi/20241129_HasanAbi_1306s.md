# Cenksgiving Last Night Was Awesome | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU)
*  I think the thing about jank is that he's not like I don't think he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=0.0s)]
*  After implies that there isn't like a genuine attitude change [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=3.44s)]
*  Okay [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=7.28s)]
*  After implies that there isn't a genuine attitude [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=8.68s)]
*  I think he's just like genuinely has a difference in opinion in the issues that he speaks on where he's like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=10.44s)]
*  Legitimately more conservative on those issues whether it happened over the course of the last couple of years [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  But I don't know if it happened like super fast, but I think that there has been an attitude shift where he is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=21.48s)]
*  One more giveaway for good measure sure I like that that chatter also is implying that like people use Zionist as a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=30.04s)]
*  as a word to substitute for you know Jewish person and he wants to harass like in this hypothetical you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=38.04s)]
*  Like that's cool. The word capitulation will be my bingo card. It's one your most used Lamau [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=46.44s)]
*  It's cuz you know, it's cuz it's a pretty big. What is this? Jank is 100% cook, bro [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=50.6s)]
*  I [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=56.88s)]
*  Think I got to him a little bit though last night after [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=59.68s)]
*  shaky Gerga giving where I [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=63.52s)]
*  Had a conversation with him [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=67.08s)]
*  Because he was like, why do you think cuz cuz you know, we were talking about like why? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=69.08s)]
*  I think he was like, why do you think he's like, why do you think he's like, why do you think he's like, why do you think he's like [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=76.04s)]
*  Cuz cuz you know, we were talking about like why [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  CNN and all these other like traditional outlets are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=86.8s)]
*  more receptive to what I have to say than him and he always thinks is because I'm hot and young and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  cool and hip and he's not he's old and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  Rugged and I was like no dude is because of the way you carry yourself [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  Like like I have my criticisms of mainstream outlets all the time. I have my criticisms other commentators [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=104.72s)]
*  I have my disagreements with them, but like the energy that you bring to any conversation [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=110.64s)]
*  Including someone like myself who loves you like I straight-up told him [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=118.08s)]
*  I was like if any if anyone that I had actually talked to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=122.28s)]
*  Anyone that I like quote-unquote debated or whatever treated me like the way you did [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  Like I would I would never ever in a million years allow that like I would never allow that to happen [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  And if you're having that energy with me someone, you know, you love your nephew then [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm assuming you carry that energy with a lot of people [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  You don't know that well who don't have that familial relationship and yeah that breeds resentment that breeds anger and it's like [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=147.6s)]
*  Overall very unnecessary, you know [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  and I think he got that he understood that a little bit cuz I was like cuz I basically was like listen I would [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=157.04s)]
*  never allow another person to talk to me like the way you talk to me and and you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  Of course, it doesn't mean anything between you and I cuz [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, you've seen me. Okay, like you're my uncle. I love you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=171.88s)]
*  But you know like that's if you're if you're doing that to me, I'm assuming you do that to other people as well [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  And yeah, they probably you know, they probably don't like that. This was after dinner. Yeah [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=182.06s)]
*  I think the thing about jank is that he's not like I don't think he [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=187.72s)]
*  There implies that there isn't like a genuine attitude change [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=191.32s)]
*  Okay [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=195.16s)]
*  After implies that there isn't a genuine attitude change [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=196.6s)]
*  I think he's just like genuinely has a difference in opinion in the issues that he speaks on where he's like legitimately more [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=198.52s)]
*  conservative on those issues [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  Whether it happened over the course of the last couple of years, but I don't know if it happened like super fast [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=206.68s)]
*  but I think that there has been an attitude shift where he is and I tried to I basically tried to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Get him to come to that conclusion like I try to walk through the steps [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=220.16s)]
*  Slowly but surely by being like there was a point where you were a fighter [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  You've always been a progressive fighter, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=228.4s)]
*  you did not worry yourself about like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=230.72s)]
*  What the what the Democratic wishes of the of the base of support in the party looks like you don't worry about that when it comes [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=233.28s)]
*  to Medicare for all because you know [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  That's right. And you know that if you champion that message then like people will inevitably come on board with that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=241.78s)]
*  But it seems like for a lot of these other issues you're you know, you're you're [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=247.72s)]
*  You're willing to cast aside [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=253.66s)]
*  Certain groups in the way that you communicate about these issues [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=256.98s)]
*  Because you're terrified of the fact that there is no solution that the Democratic Party will offer them like even the abortion conversation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=260.78s)]
*  That wasn't supposed to be like me finding out what his perspective is. I was just trying [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  I thought that we were in agreement on abortion [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=272.38s)]
*  that any sort of legislative hurdle like that on a process that already is like [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=274.78s)]
*  Automatically limited to the people that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  Need it desperately given the invasive nature of the surgery and the cost of it alone that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=283.82000000000005s)]
*  Any sort of additional legislative hurdle is going to cause problems in the same vein that like any sort of restriction on abortion [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=290.82000000000005s)]
*  causes problems and then I wanted to use that as an example to bring it back to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=298.62s)]
*  I wanted to use that as an example to bring it back to the subject matter on like, you know [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  Three strikes and you're out. It's a felony conversation [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=308.78s)]
*  You know because when you add additional restrictions on our already very restrictive very draconian criminal justice system [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  You end up, you know, it's the it's the dynamic that you know [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=320.14s)]
*  Three jewelry thefts like the guy who stole jewelry three times versus the guy who stole pizza [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=324.08s)]
*  Three times, you know what? I mean like there are a significant [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  Significantly larger number of people who will be stealing three slices of pizza over, you know doing jewelry theft and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=335.98s)]
*  And yes, I think that the way it works is the way the law works is you're supposed to because it's so broad sweeping [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  Yes, you either say nah like all of those people have to go to prison all of those people that like steal, you know [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=351.1s)]
*  here and there they have to go to prison because they're routine offenders and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=359.06s)]
*  And and and repeat offenders rather than it just you know [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=363.14s)]
*  As long as the the guy who's like stealing jewelry is going to prison too. I don't think that that's alright [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=367.66s)]
*  Anyway, your point about your core values being that you're okay with a jewel thief being free if it means the three pizza guys free [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=372.94s)]
*  Also resonated. Well, I think I hope I hope people understood what I was saying [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=378.54s)]
*  Like that doesn't mean that you know [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=382.82s)]
*  We shouldn't prosecute rape or whatever and it doesn't even mean we shouldn't prosecute grand larceny or theft of all these different varieties [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=384.62s)]
*  It's just that like when it comes to criminal justice reform, you either have the opinion of like we need more deterrence [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=391.18s)]
*  We need more violence in the criminal justice system [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=398.02s)]
*  That will operate as a deterrent to stop people and make people think twice for they do engage in crime [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  or or we need to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=408.42s)]
*  dramatically move in the opposite direction where we focus on rehabilitation in an effort to lower [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=411.06s)]
*  Recidivism rates as other countries have successfully done and we need to address the root cause in which crime [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=417.9s)]
*  Manifests and I think there is a crisis here [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=424.66s)]
*  Born out of nihilism born out of being a progressive champion for 25 plus years as jank has been [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=428.3s)]
*  Where he is basically throughout time recognize that like no solutions are coming. No broad sweeping solutions that will [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=434.9s)]
*  tackle the issue [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=442.74s)]
*  Exactly at the root cause [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=444.74s)]
*  You know fixing the housing market adding additional social safety nets after school programs and the like so he's like we have to stop the bleeding [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=446.62s)]
*  and the only way to stop the bleeding is by [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=454.7s)]
*  being even more aggressive and being even more violent in our penalties and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=458.7s)]
*  That in and of itself is a terrifying prospect. That's when you that's when you cave to the the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=464.74s)]
*  Nary in your mind when you when you give in and it's kind of terrifying [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  It's uh, you know, it's it's something that I've noticed that we are at the you know, we're at the precipice of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=479.56s)]
*  Why my Germany? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=487.28s)]
*  Style governance here. We have like the hyper nationalist hyper right-wing [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=489.12s)]
*  Republican Party and we have the liberals that are also caving on those fears that they very [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=493.96s)]
*  Effectively they very effectively communicate to and not only is it but those fears are also coming out of like, you know real [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  societal problems and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=508.76s)]
*  You know, it's I fear that if there isn't a massive base of if there isn't a massive base that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=511.12s)]
*  Recognizes the problem and works actively to try and fix it. We're we're just gonna keep bouldering towards [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=520.48s)]
*  I think he envies you and it's poisonous. You're ridiculous, dude. That's my uncle. He does not envy me [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=527.2s)]
*  He is he is very proud and and very happy for my success. That's crazy [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=537.96s)]
*  You got it, okay, okay [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=547.24s)]
*  You got it [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=550.9200000000001s)]
*  Did it tell me I'm wrong. This is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=553.08s)]
*  reframing an issue that is [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=556.88s)]
*  Now we've moved away from the electoral consequences of a trans ad to your own [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=559.72s)]
*  Personal anger and frustration that you have with left-wing media online [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=566.48s)]
*  Are making everyone think they are the left [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, we are super extreme we want to yes were the last and it was not see not see not see not see not see [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=576.96s)]
*  yeah, I just I [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=583.72s)]
*  I just don't think that this is like I think no one in this conference [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  No one that was mentioned in this conversation has any real motion whatsoever in moving the needle [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=591.0s)]
*  Like no disrespect to anybody [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  You know [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  Lance in the serfs or the young Turks like even together [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=598.64s)]
*  We have no motion the most motion that Jake ever had was with the Justice Democrats, right? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=602.4799999999999s)]
*  alongside Kyle Kalinsky and that wasn't because of the the the massive audiences that they had that was because [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  They were actually like the Working Families Party or the DSA in certain instances like [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=614.8s)]
*  Successfully moving the Democratic Party in the correct direction [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  That's what brought us the squad right and and it came only because of yeah [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean that that progressive swing also happened because of Bernie Sanders too, which opened up the floodgates for that kind of [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=628.2399999999999s)]
*  communication so yes sunrise movement too, and I [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=635.12s)]
*  think like [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=639.16s)]
*  having getting lost in the minutia of [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=640.5999999999999s)]
*  You know online commentary stuff is is silly. I don't know. It's just so it's just not good [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  It's not good. It's not smart. Do you think that America's culture of violence contributes to our crime issue in a memorable way? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  I just feel like our culture we grew up in America is different than nori for example [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=658.0400000000001s)]
*  I think American culture contributes to it, but culture is just a reflection of the material realities [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=661.48s)]
*  So I think it's a it's you know [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=666.52s)]
*  Historically speaking American culture is developed off of American proto-capitalist sentiment early on with the pilgrims and and and has [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=670.12s)]
*  Evolved into what it is now this like incredibly violent aberration, so American culture was far more left during FDR and earlier [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=679.12s)]
*  Yeah on certain aspects you're right [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=686.68s)]
*  on unlike [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=689.88s)]
*  Adjusted to its time on [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=692.52s)]
*  Economic improvements yes, but obviously socially speaking fuck no [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=694.76s)]
*  You know what I mean like we had the Jim Crow South at that point the New Deal also [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=699.06s)]
*  Specifically carved out black people like this is not you know this is pre civil rights [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=703.6s)]
*  We had internment camps for Japanese people there were a lot of there were a lot of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=708.6s)]
*  Progressive there were a lot of progressive policies that were implemented in terms of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=713.56s)]
*  economic policies [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=718.24s)]
*  but there was also a shit ton of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=720.16s)]
*  Regressive a shit ton of reactionary policies that were also implemented for marginalized populations, and I don't think that it's appropriate to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=724.04s)]
*  Cast these people aside. I don't think it's a [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  Appropriate to write them out. You know what I mean, so I I disagree with that friend of the show unfriend of the show violence [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=734.5999999999999s)]

*  I mean he cooked here to you okay [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=755.12s)]
*  Have you not got enough credit for breaking the news that Joe Biden is old you think you'd have more shame [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=757.3199999999999s)]
*  But I understand that this is just like a game of sims for you [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=761.36s)]
*  He said a good ad for the importance of independent media. I think instead should go on the pod Jones [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=763.52s)]
*  I think the pod John should have him on I hate seeing my oomphs fight my Twitter oomphs. You know the girls are fighting [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=768.88s)]

*  Grow watching Jake in high school. There's a major influence on me politically [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=786.96s)]
*  But I became totally disillusioned in 2016 disengaged until I found your commentary. It feels like I grew TYT [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=789.72s)]
*  I mean, maybe I think that these guys also think that like there is a real amount of like [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=794.36s)]
*  Audience capture that like those who are on the hyper left woke left [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=800.52s)]
*  Whatever the fuck you want to call it people like myself engage in [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=804.08s)]
*  Like they can't comprehend that like I genuinely don't give a shit about trans people [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=807.04s)]
*  Participating with cis people in athletic competition like I just don't care and not only do I not care [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=813.32s)]
*  but I also understand exactly where that fucking anger and resentment comes from and it's weird because like they also [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=819.44s)]
*  Understand where that anger and resentment comes from. This is a like this is a [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=825.76s)]
*  Deliberate mechanism to create a permission structure to shit on trans people like yeah, so I'm not gonna play [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=830.5600000000001s)]

*  And I think every time you even have that conversation [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=839.3399999999999s)]
*  Whether in defense of it or whether you are there to like showcase how rational you are as opposed to these like crazies on the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=843.18s)]
*  Left or whatever you're basically giving it more legitimacy [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=849.38s)]
*  You're giving it more air and I I don't I don't think that it's necessary [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=852.62s)]
*  Other than talk about how fucking silly and insidious and ridiculous. These bills are these ain't the trans bills are [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=857.14s)]
*  By by pointing to the the madness of it all I think that in and of itself is a much more successful strategy [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=863.9399999999999s)]
*  like of [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=871.74s)]

*  People can't see it the way that I do and it's my fault [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=877.98s)]
*  I should be able to communicate this a little bit better than I have and I don't think I've done a good enough job [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=881.7s)]
*  You know granting a permission of persecution because some people don't like it [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=888.42s)]
*  They said that for desegregation exactly exactly every step of the way [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=892.62s)]
*  every step of the way there is going to be [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=897.1s)]
*  Every step of the way there is going to be people that are are you know not going to agree [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=900.5s)]
*  With with whatever whatever progress that you want to implement, right? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=906.5400000000001s)]

*  I think it's our job as [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=917.1400000000001s)]
*  progressives to communicate [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=919.7s)]
*  It's our job [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=922.74s)]
*  as progressives to basically communicate why these things are [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=924.34s)]
*  You know these attacks are silly or why these things are not a bad thing at all [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=929.46s)]
*  Why these these policy measures are not bad at all if they are making it easier for people to be? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=934.5s)]
*  Themselves in public and it doesn't hurt a single fucking person. It was very frustrating [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=941.38s)]
*  People don't hate change. They fear change our job is to educate people so they don't fear. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Anyway [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=946.82s)]

*  instead of trying to have like a normal polite conversation where I try to reason with them because [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=983.78s)]
*  I'm either this is this is where I thrive. Okay, we can have polite disagreements, but I'm like here to [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=989.54s)]

*  I thought it was on Piers Morgan. You could tell how much of the community is new [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1066.78s)]
*  yeah, I I don't I think Jake is a perfect person to have these sorts of conversations with though because like [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1069.94s)]

*  Yeah, there is something very funny about like he despises Gavin Newsom and all these like woke progressive da's or whatever and [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1106.9s)]
*  I asked him about I asked him specifically about like Gavin Newsom [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1115.5s)]
*  I asked him specifically about like Gavin Newsom who directly [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1120.3799999999999s)]
*  Participated in like clearing out a homeless in Kamen and he was like it's too little too late [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1124.46s)]
*  He just did that because people were pressuring him and it's like at that point [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1127.84s)]
*  I was like damn that you were just right wing on this position like that's exactly what a Republican would say [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1131.94s)]
*  okay, like and and it's ironic because like [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1138.5s)]
*  The entire point that I was making is that you can never get right wingers to be on board with your policies [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1142.54s)]
*  It literally does not matter [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1148.5600000000002s)]
*  Because they will always turn around and still call you out and say that now you're still in favor of this [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1151.3200000000002s)]
*  And I he kind of did that for Gavin Newsom, you know [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1156.3600000000001s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is threatening cities if y'all don't start clearing in Kamen as they won't get any money [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1161.6000000000001s)]

*  He he used that not as a pejorative. That's the thing. He used that as a positive. But yeah [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT01RqNiRiU&t=1170.48s)]
