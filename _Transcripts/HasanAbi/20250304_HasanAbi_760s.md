# Trump Supporters Are Becoming Blind | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI)
*  You just said the economic hardships are fine because the God, our heavenly father, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=0.0s)]
*  anointed Donald Trump to be president. The economic hardships of Biden was a tremendous [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=8.0s)]
*  failure. Like in the same... What? How? Like, do you not have any self-preservation skills? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=13.84s)]
*  Like, I don't understand how these people don't realize it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=19.76s)]
*  Is it like... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=23.12s)]
*  But before we get to all of that, let's watch the Trump supporters walking away from CNN [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=28.520000000000003s)]
*  interview when pressed about Musk's actions, because I do want to see the hogs here. This [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=35.04s)]
*  is quite literally hogs going hog wild. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=40.2s)]
*  You know, somebody smarter than Elon Musk. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=43.68s)]
*  You can be smart and immoral. You can be smart and make bad decisions. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=51.48s)]
*  You are 100% right about that. There's no doubt about that. It does not give me pause. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm 100% Team Musk. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=59.72s)]
*  Josh Eben Kirkland is one of the people we spoke to at a hog show in Nehona, Georgia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  We first came to Brantley County right before the election because it was the most pro-Trump [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=67.36s)]
*  county in a swing state in 2020. People had had a strong emotional connection to President [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=71.44s)]
*  Trump, and they thought Trump was for them instead of the elites. So we wanted to see [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=76.8s)]
*  what they made of billionaire Elon Musk. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=81.16s)]
*  There's a lot of ifs, ands, ands, ands about Musk, and he's a brilliant man himself. I [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  think a lot of people are scared that the two of them have teamed up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Last time we were here, Kathy... [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=91.52s)]
*  I love this. I mean, this is straight up my favorite thing. As you guys know, people who [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=92.96s)]
*  sell Trump merch, like their entire lives revolve around getting products from China [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  and drop shipping products from China and just like selling it to dumb American hogs. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=104.36s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=109.32s)]
*  Nancy Hendricks sold Trump merch in a corner of her boutique. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=110.32s)]
*  Yeah, people who will perhaps suffer the most, people who will perhaps suffer the most from [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=113.16s)]
*  tariffs on China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=120.6s)]
*  I sold out of everything. I sold out of all my Trump stuff. I have sold the daddy's home. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=122.8s)]
*  Why do people like that, calling Trump daddy? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=129.12s)]
*  There is a security in daddy. Mama is the one that runs everything. Mama is the one [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=132.12s)]
*  that does everything. But there is a security in daddy. When daddy wraps his arms around [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=137.12s)]
*  you, you feel like the whole world is just... you're safe. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=142.2s)]
*  This is pure, straight up, amazing, fantastic. Okay, this is... I mean, it's not interesting. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  This is at the heart of a lot of the reception for Trump. That is what it is. So much. When [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=157.64s)]
*  did Hogwarts become Goon Watch, bro? Listen, he gets the Debra's and the Barbara's quaking. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=165.4s)]
*  Okay, that Barbussy is quaking. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=171.24s)]
*  Everything is... everything's going to be okay. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=175.68s)]
*  And that's the way they mean it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=177.84s)]
*  And that's the way they mean it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=179.28s)]
*  Because, you know, on the internet at least, sometimes it has like a sexual meaning. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=180.28s)]
*  Oh, Lord. So what do you think of the job he's done so far? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=184.68s)]
*  It's like Christmas morning every single day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=188.68s)]
*  The ticket prices are $35 a carton. Let me tell you, Christmas morning. I love him. What [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=191.52s)]
*  has he done that has noticeably improved your life in a meaningful fashion in the past 30 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=198.92s)]
*  plus days that he's been in office? Almost 44... 44 days that he's been in office. What [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=208.56s)]
*  has he done? It's so great. Made them come. Yeah. I guess. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=214.48s)]
*  Hendrix introduced us to Candace Taylor, who declared she's running for Congress that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=220.76s)]
*  very day on Steve Bannon's War Room podcast. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=225.16s)]
*  I want to announce with you, you are loyal to President Trump. God anoints people. He's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  anointed President Trump. So if Elon Musk wants to cut trillions of... [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  This is... the accent is off, but this is kingdom come ass bullshit. Okay. Our Heavenly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=236.76s)]
*  Father has anointed the Lordship in the position of absolute authority. My Lord, my liege, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=244.04s)]
*  my life for you, my liege. I do not need the bounties of the... I do not need access to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  nor do I need the eggs that my chickens lay. It's all for you, my Lordship. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=266.28s)]
*  ...dollars out of this budget. And if my family has to tighten our belt and not go on vacation [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=274.4s)]
*  because of it, I'm down with that. Oh, wait. Oh my God. She literally did that. That was [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=280.44s)]
*  it. I was joking. Trump. So if Elon Musk wants to cut trillions of dollars out of this budget [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=287.52s)]
*  and if my family has to tighten our belt and not go on vacation because of it, I'm down with that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=293.28s)]
*  What the hell, bro? Oh my God. Oh my... It's so good. It's amazing. Yeah. No, I don't... [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=305.84s)]
*  I don't need goods. It's for a greater cause. So you welcome some personal financial hardship if [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=313.2s)]
*  you think in the long run it will help. Yeah, I've already experienced it. Under Biden with [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=322.8s)]
*  inflation, I mean, were you happy to pay the higher prices or did you think that was a failing of his [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=328.0s)]
*  presidency? It was a tremendous failing. All right. How long are you willing to wait for the... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=332.8s)]
*  How do you know? What? You don't understand what's going on here? You just said the economic [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=338.48s)]
*  hardships are fine because the God, our heavenly father anointed Donald Trump to be president. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=347.44s)]
*  The economic hardships of Biden was a tremendous failure. Like in the same... What? How? Like, do [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=356.4s)]
*  you not have any self-preservation skills? Like, I don't understand how these people don't realize [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=362.64s)]
*  that like they look like absolute dumbasses. It's just... You look... You sound like you're in a cult. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you are in a cult. It is a cult. This is cultish thinking. Was Biden anointed by God? No. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=376.16s)]
*  That's right. Didn't think so. True. Fair. Facts. You're right. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=382.88000000000005s)]
*  ...economic changes you're hoping to see for the prices to come down. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=387.44s)]
*  Oh, I'm good if President Trump wants to run in 2028. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=390.24s)]
*  In 2022, Taylor ran in the Republican primary for governor with a Jesus Guns baby slogan and lost. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=393.36s)]
*  But why run for Congress if some billionaire can just undo whatever budget you passed, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  whatever laws you passed? Oh, he's not undoing everything. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=406.72s)]
*  He's dealing with stuff that's frivolous. Most people we spoke to were enthusiastic about Musk. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=411.44s)]
*  We did meet three people who had some concerns about the firing of federal workers, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  but the only one who wanted to say so on camera was Corbett Wilson, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  one of the rare Trump skeptics we found last time we visited. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=425.6s)]
*  Prices of groceries and prices haven't gone down since Trump took office. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  Give him a little bit of time. Will you come back in a year or two years? Let's look at the halfway [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=434.16s)]
*  point because we all know everything takes time. Well, he promised it on the first day. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  He promises to take steps. And anybody that believed that's crazy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=445.12s)]
*  He also said that it would probably be a little more painful to start with, but it would get better. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=448.16s)]
*  We got to get a lot of white done. You're talking about a contractor. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=452.8s)]
*  I think in some respects, liberals have tainted in their own base of support. They've tainted [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  populism as an effective communication tool so much. And they just actively undermine people [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=466.64s)]
*  that could actually reach these guys so much. People like Bernie Sanders, that they've made [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  way for someone like Donald Trump to come in and basically brainwash these people. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=480.48s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of internalized resentment there that plays a role as well, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  because Trump is playing on a lot of the things that they care about. A lot of things that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=490.56s)]
*  television has told them they should be afraid of. I guess my point is I'm jealous. I'm jealous that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=495.20000000000005s)]
*  like economic hardships in the short term are likely for anyone that changes the trajectory [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=504.32s)]
*  of American empire or changes the trajectory of the American economy, right? Make no mistake. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=511.2s)]
*  I think that if there was some kind of communist Trump, for example, a laughable notion for many [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=517.68s)]
*  different reasons, I'm not going to get into it right now. But if there was a situation like that, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=523.52s)]
*  I'm sure that there would be some economic struggle in the interim when you're breaking [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=528.48s)]
*  the system only to rebuild it. But the reality of the matter is no one would entertain this. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=533.28s)]
*  Like no one would ever entertain this even sidestepping away from the way things work [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  by a liberal administration by like 1% by a tiny sliver margin would cause people to, you know, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=546.16s)]
*  do riots in America. Okay. These people are the same people that lost their minds when ironically [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  enough Donald Trump was the one who told them that they can't get haircuts. Donald Trump [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=562.16s)]
*  immediately turned around and said, okay, it's up to the States. I mean, he buckled, he caved. He [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  did not care about the preservation of American health. I don't know. I can't help but feel, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=574.0s)]
*  I can't help but feel jealous that Trump has this level of brainwashing capabilities on [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  these kinds of Americans who support him. Where even if he does things that Americans truly care [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=587.92s)]
*  about, which is like cost of goods, they're still like, no, no, it's going to be better. It's going [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=595.28s)]
*  to get better. Jealous? Yes, I am. I am jealous. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk, he's got business interests, whether in the US or the US, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=603.92s)]
*  whether in the US or the US, he's got business interests, whether in the US or the US, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=607.68s)]
*  do you trust Elon Musk? He's a government, he's got business interests, whether in defense, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=611.68s)]
*  internet, that kind of thing. He's also admitted to drug use. He smoked pot on a Joe Rogan show. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=619.12s)]
*  Do you trust him as like a stable, rational and reasonable person to be doing this job? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=625.04s)]
*  Hey, he's a Republican. You ain't going to talk him out of that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=631.28s)]
*  There's potheads all over this country. Y'all sitting here trying to bash one man for 99% [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=635.04s)]
*  of this country, Republican or Democrat, this whole dad gum tail smokes pot. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=640.64s)]
*  Dad gum. No, dad gum it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=644.96s)]
*  The conversation devolved quickly. I mean, he looks like the perfect guy to say dad gum, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=647.52s)]
*  unlike that one sitting US representative we were talking about. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=652.88s)]
*  That anticipated the emotional connection when he already felt with Musk. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nenftUp2FLI&t=656.16s)]
