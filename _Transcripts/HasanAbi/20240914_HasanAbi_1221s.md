# Destiny's Community Is Going Crazy | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs)
*  Every destiny N word has a hundred times the impact of Hassan Abiy Twitter Royd saying a white slur. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=0.0s)]
*  So it's a war of attrition here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=5.8s)]
*  They're talking about how destiny says the N word on Twitter and it really it really ruins their image their image that they're trying to cultivate of being against Hassan because they have no consistent or coherent politics beyond. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=7.8s)]
*  Do you have a take that used to go hard for that you no longer agree with? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=21.0s)]
*  No. Speaking of takes that I go hard for that I am completely correct on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=29.5s)]
*  Remember what I told you yesterday about you guys being and how I can't like react to anything Ethan related because you behave in an unhinged way. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=35.2s)]
*  And sometimes that unhinged behavior is is immediately tracked by an increase an insanely unhinged community. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  I just saw this this is insane. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  While destiny's community continues to harass us on in his community yet over again over the recent criticisms of Ethan. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  Here's a long thread proving yet again who this rabid audience destiny is cultivated are note the screenshots of DD DG years spreading anti-semitic lies about age three. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=63.0s)]
*  Like making fun of Hila saying she's a slay Queen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=72.8s)]
*  Okay saying Ethan participated in sex tourism like that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=76.5s)]
*  But there is one part about this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=82.5s)]
*  This guy says to be honest a Nazi is better than a terrorist who's better than a registered sex offender who's better than a Hassan piker fan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=84.0s)]
*  But it doesn't end there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=90.5s)]
*  One thing I saw on this thread that is actually nutty is how many mentions of my name that is in this discord. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=92.5s)]
*  It is 90,000 the destiny discord has mentioned me 90,000 times now destiny is a video game and a streamer and I doubt that and a word that people use in normal conversation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=101.5s)]
*  And I'd be shocked some of hostages still defending themselves in your house and community. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=117.5s)]
*  They don't give us you said no drama in that community. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=121.5s)]
*  The fact that he has cultivated just an entire fan base with only one consistent position with only one consistent position and that position is we want to Hassan 9,000 8,900 times the word destiny was used. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=124.5s)]
*  Someone said the word destiny comes up in Hoss court 18,000 times and it's a word that has more significantly more usage than just like you know the streamer. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=141.5s)]
*  And I doubt that most of it is you know I'm certain that most of the times that it's been used is probably not about him just using it in like regular conversation like oh this is manifest destiny or something like that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=153.5s)]
*  90,000 times brother 90,000 times. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=166.5s)]
*  This is before you also look at how many times they use probably Hassan with a double S or his son or Hamasabi I'd pay top dollar for Hassan cartel footage. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=170.5s)]
*  Hassan my dog can't wait till I'm rich so I can pass on watch the video. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=182.5s)]
*  It's a series of events gang Hassan every destiny n word has a hundred times the impact of Hassan Abitwitter Roy saying a white slur. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=186.5s)]
*  So it's a war of attrition here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=195.5s)]
*  They're talking about how destiny says the n word on Twitter and it really it really ruins their image their image that they're trying to cultivate of being against Hassan because they have no consistent or coherent politics beyond saying this is a war of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=197.5s)]
*  saying this guy is awful. Remember when I saw those traffic Slavic children in Germany Twitter Roy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=211.5s)]
*  These are like 38 year old people by the way with like jobs in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=217.5s)]
*  because the Sun fans believe everything that is spoon fed to them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=227.5s)]
*  Yo can it DGG clip Hassan piker clip for me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=230.5s)]
*  He said one of the most r worded things I've heard when we were arguing and it won't let me clip it like they literally. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=233.5s)]
*  They literally are watching they're watching right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=239.5s)]
*  They're watching right now and in their discord they're talking like oh I can't wait to clip this and post it on Reddit and brigade it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=242.5s)]
*  This is unimaginably pathetic dog. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=251.5s)]
*  It is crazy weird jokes they made about brigading and mass reporting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=254.5s)]
*  Does anyone have a link for Hassan's discord server. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=260.5s)]
*  Yo I'm trying to find the Twitch guidelines they state that a streamer cannot restream another band streamer ie his son restreaming destiny. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=263.5s)]
*  Can someone link me the correct section that would have that or point me in the right direction. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=269.5s)]
*  I'm going to report a song for skit so thanks for reminding me. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=274.5s)]
*  I'm actually report a song right now as on a dozen here both the same edge lords. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=279.5s)]
*  Yes we should stop saying our word is the same way destiny as I was saying skit so guys heads up if you brigade Hassan discord and any of the mod team find out you will be perma [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=283.5s)]
*  like it dude this level I'm gonna be honest with you this level of obsession is not good. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=292.5s)]
*  Okay it's just not good is really bad. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=298.5s)]
*  I promise you it's not good for your mental health. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=301.5s)]
*  Okay it's not you've devoted so much of your time to something that is just an objective waste. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=303.5s)]
*  Okay we have a finite amount of time on this earth. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=311.5s)]
*  Why are you wasting it like this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=315.5s)]
*  I'll be for real the only way forward is destiny dropping a Hassan manifesto nuke and end his career as early as possible. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=317.5s)]
*  I feel bad for the misguided low IQ that actually follows ideology especially when it comes to this Israel Palestine issue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=323.5s)]
*  Twitch isn't going to do about it for sure. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=330.5s)]
*  Imagine being Hassan viewer yuck. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=332.5s)]
*  I'll better rot in hell than being a conscious conscious soul that actively watches Hassan streams. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=334.5s)]
*  I wish we could deport Hassan to Turkey. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=338.5s)]
*  Yeah I'm so happy we can make fun of Freud can I mean fat guy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=341.5s)]
*  I mean pork and I mean fro beast. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=345.5s)]
*  I mean Hassan's mod again. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=347.5s)]
*  Hid job of the hut that J. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=349.5s)]
*  Miles guy you yelled at was a DJ all along. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=350.5s)]
*  I'm actually surprised. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=353.5s)]
*  Yeah is that surprising. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=355.5s)]
*  Most of the time when I'm yelling at someone who is like presenting themselves as a just curious Andy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=357.5s)]
*  They're actually just simply coming from this rabid sociopaths unhinged as community to come in here and present themselves as though they are making a sound [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=365.5s)]
*  argument and they just want to simply have their mind changed only so they can slowly but surely piss me off and then clip it and then post it on Twitter and the likes of Keemstar love that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=374.5s)]
*  OK this has been ongoing once again. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=387.5s)]
*  This has been ongoing for the past five years now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=390.5s)]
*  Five it's been happening for five years. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=394.5s)]
*  OK it's sad. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=398.5s)]
*  Get a life please. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=400.5s)]
*  I do I do wish that they could just get the access to health care that they desperately need and a sense of community beyond whatever this is whatever is going on here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=402.5s)]
*  This is just discord with some added reddit post the community is obsessed their Twitter group their subreddit is all just sexism anti-Semitism Islamophobia and jokes about incest young children. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=413.5s)]
*  Obviously this doesn't apply to every destiny fan but this has been going on for years and destiny actively encourages it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=422.5s)]
*  I'm posting these for two reasons one to show the hypocrisy and harassment defense have participated in not only in a sauce community but his friends and also Ethan's that even fake screenshots of a sounds chat which is some prove were fake live on stream by pulling up the logs. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=428.5s)]
*  Hassan actively bands anti-Semitic comments and goes out of his way to explain chatters I will point it is every day. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=441.5s)]
*  Second reason is to advise people in a sauce community not to engage with these accounts do not harass them. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=446.5s)]
*  They will try to bait you just block and move on. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=450.5s)]
*  Pay them no attention. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=452.5s)]
*  I'm also at fault for lashing out because I find the things destiny said disgusting. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=453.5s)]
*  But yeah from now on mass blog ignore and focus continuing to uplift our own community. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=456.5s)]
*  Sorry this third is so long and all over the place. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=460.5s)]
*  Peace and love is just like team sports like Raiders versus Steelers. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=462.5s)]
*  It will never stop in America is a culture thing as old as baseball. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=465.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=467.5s)]
*  The issue is I don't like our Raiders fans stalking Steelers fans and like monitoring their every activity and then trying to go to the local media to be like see this guy actually threw his trash out wrong. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=468.5s)]
*  You should do something about it and then celebrating it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=481.5s)]
*  And then we also have this to look look look look. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=484.5s)]
*  We also have this idiotic to you have to admit most of the measures that Dean Hoss scored or him or about him. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=487.5s)]
*  You are diluting yourself. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=492.5s)]
*  You think Hoss was talking about manifest or the game like we also have either more destiny fans who have been also 59 month subscribers or just like unhinged weirdos themselves who have been 59 month subscribers whose brains have been broken by. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=493.5s)]
*  Trying to debate every minutia. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=510.5s)]
*  I'm simply stating that the term destiny has more utilization than literally just the streamer not in the same way that the term Hassan is just my name. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=512.5s)]
*  There is like one other has there's two other Hassans out there. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=524.5s)]
*  Mehdi Hassan and Hassan Minhaj. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=528.5s)]
*  I doubt that they're talking about them that much. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=530.5s)]
*  This is most likely a double fan which is the weirdest kind of person. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=533.5s)]
*  Literally making a very idiotic argument like as though destiny the term does not have multiple utilizations including its own dictionary definition called it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=539.5s)]
*  No I just see there's brainwraith on both sides. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=550.5s)]
*  You did it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=553.5s)]
*  You're doing it right now. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=554.5s)]
*  You're refusing to see the argument that I've presented. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=556.5s)]
*  You are trying to have a semantics argument on whether or not there is an actual dictionary definition for the term destiny and could be applied outside of the streamer in an instance where there's only 8000 mentions. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=558.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=572.5s)]
*  Approximately 5000 of the utilization of the term destiny in my discord out of the 8000 come from the gaming segment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=573.5s)]
*  Do you think that the gaming section in my discord is talking about the streamer and that's what they figured out is the best way to do it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=583.5s)]
*  8000 times the word destiny has been used in my 8000 times the word destiny has been used in my discord as opposed to 90000 times that the word Hassan has been used in his discord. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=591.5s)]
*  The name that the term destiny literally has multiple uses regardless. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=602.5s)]
*  It's both a video game and also on top of that is just a word in the English language is not just simply a name and you still try to do both sides. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=608.5s)]
*  Why one must ask the question why did you try to do that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=617.5s)]
*  The numbers on the board obviously show that that one side is unimaginably unhinged. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=621.5s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=627.5s)]
*  Okay you're right. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=628.5s)]
*  I don't go on how score that much. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=629.5s)]
*  No, that's not the problem. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=630.5s)]
*  The problem is you heard me say something and because you're a fan of both of us you immediately wanted to go well both sides have some issues. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=632.5s)]
*  Why think about what happens in your mind that causes you to immediately reflexively go well there's both sides that are being unhinged 5000 of the times that anyone has ever said destiny in my in my community. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=640.5s)]
*  It was in it was in reference to the video game. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=654.5s)]
*  One side is cyber stalking me and my fans and the people I collaborate with actively as I just showed you the other side is not a community that hyper focuses on this cretin for obvious reasons because guess what for the past five years I myself have not been hyper focusing on this person and the only time I ever talked about it straight up. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=657.5s)]
*  The only time I ever talked about it was when he just completely went unhinged after presenting himself as a liberal or even a leftist or a progressive and then actively made pro arguments. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=681.5s)]
*  If you check his Twitter community there's multiple measures of every day they're literally obsessed and there's one dude who literally spends all day every day just watching your streaming clipping what he thinks is cancelable and posting it in his Twitter community. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=692.5s)]
*  Someone in your Twitter community posted that the user is that one pokey stalker you talked about on your stream that's been harassing you since 2019. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=702.5s)]
*  Yeah they're crazy anyway like I said just don't reflexively try to do the both side. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=708.5s)]
*  Okay because there is no both sides in this there's no both sides in this situation unless you're a dupe or a sucker. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=714.5s)]
*  How come you don't address this happening in your discord. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=720.5s)]
*  I know this is a real problem. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=723.5s)]
*  The other part of this is my community is much larger. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=725.5s)]
*  That's the other craziness here. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=728.5s)]
*  And despite the fact that I have a much larger community the mentions are still like the mentions are still so minimal. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=732.5s)]
*  That's what's crazy about it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=742.5s)]
*  Yeah it's 30x to 1x. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=744.5s)]
*  I said bro I've been here since 2021 I've never even knew who really D was until Israel Palestine. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=746.5s)]
*  Yes because I didn't I actively did not talk about it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=751.5s)]
*  Truly unhinged. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=755.5s)]
*  How much longer till Ethan Heela divorce arc. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=757.5s)]
*  Yeah he's done a great job with crowd capture the H3 H3 crowd. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=760.5s)]
*  Ethan seems okay with whatever his son does. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=763.5s)]
*  So I don't think it will end until his son wants H3 H3 subreddit is basically his son and his son has his own popping discord. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=766.5s)]
*  Yes they both help each other out but Ethan's platform H3 H3 is being taken advantage of by his son like his son took advantage of destiny's platform. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=773.5s)]
*  They also obviously made a ton of jokes about cutie and and why isn't a son ugly at what is actually wrong with the son. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=780.5s)]
*  We make a bunch of paper targets with a son printed on him Hassan piker range targets. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=789.5s)]
*  I have touched my penis the cutie Cinderella deep fakes. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=793.5s)]
*  Would you watch fake porn a cutie Cinderella like just like bad people in general. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=796.5s)]
*  Okay and I don't think they started off as bad people. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=801.5s)]
*  Okay I don't think they started off as disgusting little monsters. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=805.5s)]
*  But this is what happens when you join a community of people that consider this to be edgy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=809.5s)]
*  Okay consider this to be cool and consider this to be fun. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=815.5s)]
*  It is straight out of 4chan poll when a portion of your community's kiwi farm cyber stalkers in this zero effort to moderate people end up emulating that behavior. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=818.5s)]
*  It's not just that it's kiwi farms and cyber stalkers. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=826.5s)]
*  It's not that there is no effort to moderate this community. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=829.5s)]
*  It's encouraged. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=832.5s)]
*  Okay that's what it is. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=834.5s)]
*  It's encouraged. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=836.5s)]
*  Is it it's monkey see monkey do if it's encouraged and reposted by the content creator then of course a lot of people are going to be like well I want him to notice me. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=837.5s)]
*  I love this person. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=846.5s)]
*  I watch him all the time. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=847.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=849.5s)]
*  So they turn around and and do this kind of unhinged in an effort to in an effort to get this support. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=850.5s)]
*  I was shocked after you rated Jason before the collab I saw so many of your haters spamming your emails and saying Hamas raid Nepal raid etc. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=858.5s)]
*  It was so sad. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=881.5s)]
*  Anyway let's move on. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=882.5s)]
*  I kind of want to watch Maher and Winkler the Fonz debate Israel. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=883.5s)]
*  Why does these anyway. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=888.5s)]
*  Why does he have to hate farm you on understand what do you mean. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=890.5s)]
*  I'm a fairly popular figure with politics that is considered completely outside of like what is permissible in American political discourse. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=893.5s)]
*  Normally it's a great target to try and pick apart every single day. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=903.5s)]
*  It's also a ton of resentment. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=907.5s)]
*  I I've always had haters. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=909.5s)]
*  Guys I've gotten death threats when I had 30 people watching me on Twitch. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=911.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=915.5s)]
*  Because I was on the Young Turks and when I was on the Young Turks I was getting death threats all day every day. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=916.5s)]
*  Even I was getting docs and getting death threats with like 4chan posts about how to me and how to literally feed my dogs like a little bit of salami if they were to ever raid my house my apartment. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=921.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=935.5s)]
*  I remember seeing that when I had no when I was broke as even before I was on Twitch like it hasn't stopped. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=938.5s)]
*  This is just the unfortunate reality. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=946.5s)]
*  This is just the unfortunate reality of of just having to deal with like the online right and anyone and everyone that has ever dealt with the online right knows this to be the reality is just something that you have to deal with on a daily fucking basis. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=949.5s)]
*  Yes there there are like there are posts from 4chan and all these other like older forums way back in like 2016. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=965.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=974.5s)]
*  Before I was even on Twitch fantasizing about how like you could do a home invasion with my address with my apartment address and talking about how in order to take care of my dogs you should bring like you know some meat with you so you can just like toss the meat to the dog to you know have the dog with you. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=975.5s)]
*  To you know have the dog pay attention to the meat itself while you shoot in me in bed. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=994.5s)]
*  The thing is that's been happening for a very long time. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=998.5s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1002.5s)]
*  That's been happening for a very long time. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1003.5s)]
*  Problem is I've always had unhinged haters. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1005.5s)]
*  I've just never had someone who presents themselves as like somewhat progressive right capture an audience with a lot of those unhinged haters from every different background. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1008.5s)]
*  I talk about a ton of issues. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1022.5s)]
*  If you are really invested in being like anti-abortion and you see my commentary on abortion you hate me then you look for a community that hates me. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1024.5s)]
*  If you're a Nazi and you hear me talk about fascism and see that I'm an anti-fascist you hate me and you look for a community that also hates me. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1034.5s)]
*  If you are I don't know pro-Kyle Rittenhouse and you see me be anti-Kyle Rittenhouse and you hate me and then you look for a community that hates me. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1044.5s)]
*  If you're anti-trans and I'm obviously openly pro-trans and you hate me and you look for a community that hates me. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1052.5s)]
*  That's why I'm saying like a lot of stuff online a lot of stuff online can be brigaded. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1060.5s)]
*  It's far from it's far from what is normal what like normal people's attitudes and opinions are. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1066.5s)]
*  So don't be dissuaded by this kind of shit okay. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1072.5s)]
*  Don't be don't be dissuaded by this kind of shit. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1074.5s)]
*  It's completely ridiculous and it's not like what normal people are in the real world. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1076.5s)]
*  It's mostly a marker of someone who's extremely online. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1082.5s)]
*  But because things are very easy to brigade online it will and because of despite the size of this community right. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1084.5s)]
*  Despite the size of this community not this my community but the size of the psycho community that we were just talking about. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1094.5s)]
*  They can make it seem like you know there's a lot more hatred out there. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1102.5s)]
*  If they desperately look for any mention of me or my fans. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1106.5s)]
*  Sometimes they randomly will voluntarily bring me up when something else is happening right. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1112.5s)]
*  It's just you know you basically tried to do the most of what you have with your limited resources. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1118.5s)]
*  But when I say I really really really hope that these guys get better. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1131.5s)]
*  I mean it it's self-serving sure it's self-serving because if they do get better they get help. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1136.5s)]
*  Or if they get a sense of if they get a sense of like community elsewhere. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1143.5s)]
*  I think that like dude isn't this like Destiny's main Reddit moderator or something. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1148.5s)]
*  Like this is what I mean it's like dude presenting yourself as like a schizophrenic person who's stalking me is not going to make me fearful. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1158.5s)]
*  It just makes you look weird. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1166.5s)]
*  But like you're so hug boxed and so echo chambered that you think that this looks normal to the onlooker to the outsider followed by loner box. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1168.5s)]
*  Nice you know what I mean like as Destiny's top Reddit mod yeah like most normies will look at this and go what the if they even understand it at all. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1179.5s)]
*  He was in here he's never been banned. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1190.5s)]
*  Oh he's been in here. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1193.5s)]
*  Yeah back when back when huh interesting 2018 chatters and 2019 chatters. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1194.5s)]
*  Remember when's wait what fully convinced him chatters go rogue when you don't give him give him enough attention. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1200.5s)]
*  No this person was just only friendly because his intellectual daddy was friendly at the time. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1206.5s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1213.5s)]
*  Now they're regaining the Donnie O'Sullivan replies. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1214.5s)]
*  No they'll do that. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1217.5s)]
*  That's they have one speed. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1218.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyQkd0wCAvs&t=1220.5s)]
