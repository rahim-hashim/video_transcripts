# Trump Praises Himself In Joint Address To Congress | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k)
*  All right. Where's the speech? Where's the Trump speech? No, not did he see the rapper [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=0.0s)]
*  Destiny's community. I call Diddy G. All right. Let's see. Republicans to get together on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=29.24s)]
*  his budget plan, which includes extending the Donald Trump tax cuts from 2017. He's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=35.68s)]
*  going to talk a lot about the border and border security. He's going to tout what he is saying [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=41.64s)]
*  is massive deportations of people. And my brother went down the Asmongold pipeline. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=46.72s)]
*  Of course. And now he thinks I'm a little bit mixed. Now he genuinely thinks I'm a tipper [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=52.68s)]
*  for being a fan. Generally it's like a brain disease. He was such a chill dude, bro. That's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=57.68s)]
*  your brother. What the fuck was crazy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=61.88s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know how you deal with that. Save him. You don't know how American [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=72.6s)]
*  families work. I just don't think that these people genuinely think that, that you're a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=79.16s)]
*  tipperist. I don't think these people genuinely think I'm a tipperist either. Okay. Like a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=83.4s)]
*  tipper is a person that goes out and actively harms innocent civilians. All right. Deliberately. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=89.04s)]
*  Like you're not, that's not how you deal. You don't go and fall asleep in the, in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=97.56s)]
*  same house with a fucking tipperist. You can't just be like, Oh, you're a tipperist. And [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  then, you know, go to bed next to a tipperist in the same fucking house. You obviously don't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=106.64000000000001s)]
*  believe it. They think you create tippers, but I know, I know they think that bud, I [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=112.48s)]
*  know, but I don't think they genuinely believe that either. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=117.56s)]
*  You're still too charitable to these freaks because I understand that there's a shit ton [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=121.76s)]
*  of them. Okay. And there's two different methods of dealing with it. You either basically say [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  they're insane and shut them off completely, or you try to talk to them and pull them off [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  the ledge. We don't wait, by the way, we want to watch. Okay. But it hasn't started yet. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=139.24s)]
*  Chatters. What the hell? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=143.24s)]
*  A high stakes prime time address. The president's first major speech to Congress, just 43 days [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=144.24s)]
*  into his administration. Our special coverage starts right now. Tonight on Capitol Hill, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=151.08s)]
*  a critical moment for president Trump, the president said to lay out his priorities to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  coming at a turbulent moment at home and abroad. President Trump ramping up efforts to reshape [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=163.94s)]
*  the federal government as he signals a shift from decades of U.S. foreign policy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=170.94s)]
*  From NBC News, President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress, live from Washington, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=177.94s)]
*  here are Lester Holt and Savannah Guthrie. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=184.94s)]
*  And hi, everybody. Good evening. Welcome to our special coverage of President Trump's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=188.94s)]
*  address to- Why are you saying watch C-SPAN, please? C-SPAN is friggin' boring. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=192.94s)]
*  Since his second term began. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=195.94s)]
*  Here's the scene on the House floor right now where the president is expected to speak [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=197.94s)]
*  just minutes from now. He'll lay out his priorities, both foreign and domestic. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=201.94s)]
*  A senior administration official telling NBC News tonight his theme will be the renewal [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=205.94s)]
*  of the American dream. Of course, the speaker of the House, Vice President J.D. Vance, waiting [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=209.94s)]
*  there at the dais. It comes, of course, at a critical moment for President Trump and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=214.94s)]
*  for the country as he ramps up his efforts to fundamentally reshape the federal government [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=218.94s)]
*  and days after the world saw a major shift in U.S. foreign policy during his Oval Office [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=223.94s)]
*  showdown with Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=228.94s)]
*  Less than two months into his administration, the president already hitting the ground running [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=230.94s)]
*  on his agenda, including big cuts from the newly created Department of Government Efficiency [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=234.94s)]
*  along with plans for mass deportation and tariffs on our country's largest trading partners, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=239.94s)]
*  which just went into effect today. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=245.94s)]
*  So tonight we expect to hear more about the president's vision for the future when he takes the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=247.94s)]
*  post. Chat, how long until he creepily compliments on his wife? First 30 seconds. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=251.94s)]
*  He immediately. I was with J.D. Vance, his wife, but you shot. She's Indian, but I like her. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=256.94s)]
*  Two minutes in. I have noticed that, too. That's his favorite thing to do. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=266.94s)]
*  His favorite thing to do is constantly talk about people's wives. It's very weird. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=271.94s)]
*  I would have chosen a white lady, but it's OK. J.D. got a good one. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=277.94s)]
*  He's going to defend the Elon Musk led efforts to really carve out large swaths of the federal government. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=285.94s)]
*  It comes at a time when his approval rate, someone in the chat said, is this going to be tighter or is he going to ramble on my man? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=293.94s)]
*  If you think he's not going to ramble on, you have not been paying attention. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=301.94s)]
*  Donald Trump has never been tight. OK. Did you remember a Biden speech? Dude, Hassan, I'll be hypocrit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=305.94s)]
*  I love that. Thank God we got some hogs in here. Oh, I miss. I miss the hogs so much. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=311.94s)]
*  Thank you for being in here with us. Chatter. I will give you delicious lip tears that you are looking for. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=317.94s)]
*  You obviously weren't in here when I was covering Biden and shitting on him relentlessly, but it's OK. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=323.94s)]
*  It makes me happy that the liberals are in here to be like, you just hate Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=331.94s)]
*  You love to embody gave stated a union. Those close to the president in the building, my senior administration official tells me that's what we can expect to hear in the first part of the president's speech tonight. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=335.94s)]
*  Him laying out his accomplishments. I also spoke with one Democratic member who said to me just today, listen, Democrats have gotten off to a lackluster start as far as responding in a cohesive way strategically to the first six weeks of the Trump administration here. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=349.94s)]
*  But they do feel like there is some hope that they are finding their footing by focusing very sharply on issues like the economy. Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna pull up as the goals. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=363.94s)]
*  Chat to see what they're saying as well. Trust these cabinet picks were controversial. Trust me with the exception of Matt Gates, who was briefly that makes it more fun. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=371.94s)]
*  It's like live reacting alongside as a long party lines as I turn to Peter Alexander. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=381.94s)]
*  I mean, this is the president's choice to lead some of these changes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=386.94s)]
*  We are going to also see Elon Musk not entering with the cabinet, but arguably as important, if not more important in terms of what he's been doing with the federal government. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=391.94s)]
*  While we wait to see where Elon Musk is going to be sitting, is he there side by side with the cabinet? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=400.94s)]
*  He appeared in the cabinet meeting a few days ago. We saw him riding with the motorcade dressed in a suit this go around joining Donald Trump on this night. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=404.94s)]
*  I'm struck by a couple of things. How much has changed since the last time we saw Donald Trump in this position? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=411.94s)]
*  Five years ago, his last state of the union. We've had COVID since then and so many other changes. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=416.94s)]
*  Think about the room. Just the optics of this. When he first gave a joint address, there was a different vice president over his shoulder. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=421.94s)]
*  Then Mike Pence, this go around JD Vance, a different speaker of the house. Paul Ryan. This time around, of course, it's going to be Mike Johnson. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=427.94s)]
*  What we heard from him, he talked about putting an end to the trivial fights in America. There is Elon Musk. We see him in the chamber right now. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=435.94s)]
*  You talk about the trivial fights. He said, let's put an end to them. Think about all the trivial, no longer trivial. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=443.94s)]
*  The media blasts off right now with Canada, one of our closest allies with Ukraine until recently, one of our tightest allies as well. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=448.94s)]
*  The president has a lot of, a lot of unique challenges. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=456.94s)]
*  He exited. How drunk y'all think P Hex it is right now. How many, how many shots deep is he? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=459.94s)]
*  A dollar 46. This go around nearly $5 for a dozen eggs. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=465.94s)]
*  That's the country battles, the avian flu and the, and the effects of that. We want to go to Capitol Hill. Now our chief Capitol Hill correspondent, Ryan Nobles is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=469.94s)]
*  inside the house chamber in the room where it will happen. And he has a Republican Senate, a Republican house, but these are very narrow majorities. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=476.94s)]
*  And the political clock is ticking, Ryan, for him to get his agenda through. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=485.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. Savannah. And it is pretty stark when you look out at the chamber for my vantage point, which is right behind where the president will be speaking. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=490.94s)]
*  If you see like a little, if you see like a little, little carrier and P Hex's hand, you know, you know, what's up, you know, the game game recognized game. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=497.94s)]
*  He's going to get the shakes 30 minutes in. He's going to need to take a little sippy out of a sippy cup. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=506.94s)]
*  Is a representation of how this speech will likely be received here in the next few minutes. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=511.94s)]
*  I mean, it's important to keep in mind when Donald Trump first came into this chamber back in 2017, it was a very different environment than what he's going to deal with here tonight. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=515.94s)]
*  His own party wasn't necessarily 100% to be submissive. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=523.94s)]
*  Years and one, the president's all the house Democrats, express unity and counter the Trumps. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=527.94s)]
*  Nice. We're hoping that he would be the dealmaker in chief. Oh shit. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=534.94s)]
*  It by an enthusiastic GOP that has fallen completely in line behind him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=539.94s)]
*  They will shower him with applause throughout the night. In fact, one of the things to look for tonight, we saw representative Marjorie Taylor Green, who was right up there along the aisle and except expected to greet the president as she came in. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=544.94s)]
*  She's been showing her fellow members signs with this funny that reads Trump was right about everything, which is indicative of how the Republicans feel about Donald Trump right now. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=555.94s)]
*  But these Democrats hold on. Let me put the mega hat on to chatter is right in process. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=566.94s)]
*  Chatter says put the mega hat on to express your apolitical nature. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=571.94s)]
*  Alienated the Democrats. They've really given up all hope that they can guys. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=575.94s)]
*  Guys, let's not, you know, I want people to remember I am a political. Okay. And the hat of course helps you recognize that this is the, the simple populist position and also the centrist position as a centrist as a centrist. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=579.94s)]
*  I would like to wear my centrist shield. No politics here. Obviously terrorists confirmed. Excuse me. Chatter must be on a delay. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=595.94s)]
*  I'm wearing a hat that shows my loyalties to centrism, to the defense. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=605.94s)]
*  Very bright pink. That will be something that Donald Trump will have to see as he's given this address to this chamber here tonight. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=611.94s)]
*  And then we've also spotted a number of Democratic men sporting ties with yellow and blue in support of Ukraine. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=618.94s)]
*  And of course the ongoing controversy as it relates to Ukraine. Now some of these members, they've been waiting here since as early as three o'clock this afternoon to get those spots along the aisle, those coveted spots where they will get face time with the president, be able to shake his hand on national television and also have the opportunity to get an autograph of the speech after he leaves everything along those lines. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=627.94s)]
*  You can see them showing their phones and talking to each other already about this experience that they have and the prime position that they've gotten here tonight. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=649.94s)]
*  Now it's also interesting to point out as we wonder, will Democrats have any sort of vocal disapproval of this speech? Will they heckle or catcall? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=658.94s)]
*  Will any of them walk out of the chamber tonight? We've been told by Democratic leadership that they've asked their members not to to forcefully do any sort of demonstration like that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=668.94s)]
*  But they've already been warned by members of the House Freedom Caucus that any Democrat that attempts to disrupt the proceedings here face a censure resolution. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=678.94s)]
*  Now, that's right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=688.94s)]
*  That's right. We'll censure you. Are you going to pull up as you chat as well? I already did, but Trump hasn't started speaking yet, so it doesn't matter. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=689.94s)]
*  They're saying. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=698.94s)]
*  On Canada and Mexico, another 10 percent on China. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=728.94s)]
*  And in fact, many companies are saying there will be higher prices ahead for American consumers, which is interesting because President Trump has acknowledged that in part he was elected because Americans were tired of higher grocery prices. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=732.94s)]
*  We heard today from the CEO of Target, the big discount retailer, that in fact, fruits and vegetables from Mexico this winter and spring because of those tariffs, they will cost more. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=744.94s)]
*  And in a matter of days, consumers will start to pay higher prices. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=756.94s)]
*  Now we expect to hear the president talk about egg prices and blame President Biden in the prior administration. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=759.94s)]
*  He's going to he's going to blame his trade. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=765.94s)]
*  Wait, don't ban everyone. This is fuck you, dude. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=767.94s)]
*  Come on, come on, mods. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=770.94s)]
*  We got it. We got to have some fun with these losers, please. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=773.94s)]
*  The global economy will have to wait. If you ban all the losers, then we can't have fun. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=776.94s)]
*  No hog time. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=781.94s)]
*  Where did he go? I missed it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=784.94s)]
*  What was his name from the US government saying that potentially the president, he probably has some really sick thoughts in the middle. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=785.94s)]
*  No clarity yet, though. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=793.94s)]
*  You're taking away my pets. I want to play with my food. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=795.94s)]
*  Even as industry, you guys is sort of bracing for disruptions in the name of that was that higher prices all along the supply chain. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=798.94s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=805.94s)]
*  Sometimes the uncertainty itself can create. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=806.94s)]
*  Fuck off. You should stay back on for children being killed and parading that shit on your channel. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=809.94s)]
*  You were what's wrong with the world terrorist calling for city policy being murdered. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=813.94s)]
*  You are fucking scum. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=816.94s)]
*  What godless PO is gets off on kids being killed when they are Jewish. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=817.94s)]
*  Just fucking hallucinating. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=821.94s)]
*  This guy is off the sauce. I'm on banning him. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=823.94s)]
*  Did you hear me say that? Or did you see a clip of someone claiming I said that? Is the question. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=831.94s)]
*  I'm on banning that guy. I'm bringing him back. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=839.94s)]
*  I don't know if you see this. Listen up, dork. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=853.94s)]
*  I'm a political. Do you understand? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=856.94s)]
*  I'm the most apolitical man that has ever existed in this entire land. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=859.94s)]
*  Do you understand me? Look at how apolitical I am right now. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=864.94s)]
*  You're over here. It's just you and me, baby. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=868.94s)]
*  Look, look deeply into my eyes. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=871.94s)]
*  Stare into my gaze. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=873.94s)]
*  Recognize the hat. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=875.94s)]
*  This means I am a centrist. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=877.94s)]
*  This means I am the most apolitical content creator that has ever actually entertain the airwaves. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=879.94s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=886.94s)]
*  Look at the hat. I'll let the hat do the talking. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=888.94s)]
*  His legislative agenda comes into play. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=890.94s)]
*  You are going to see him make a big pitch for Congress to pass the big bill that just passed through the house. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=894.94s)]
*  It deals with the border deportation, political terrorist videos. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=899.94s)]
*  Big argument is let's get understand, baby. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=903.94s)]
*  And then that will handle any pain that's. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=906.94s)]
*  You don't get it, but you will. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=908.94s)]
*  We're expecting the introduction of the president. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=910.94s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=912.94s)]
*  And we should note as you watch this, you would be forgiven if you thought you were about to watch the State of the Union address. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=929.94s)]
*  Technically, this is a speech before a joint session of Congress. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=935.94s)]
*  The difference being in this case, it's a new president who will be looking forward, presumably, about his agenda versus a president who's been reviewed some of his accomplishments. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=939.94s)]
*  And now we see the long walk in. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=951.94s)]
*  The First Lady, of course, has several guests with her and has become a tradition. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=953.94s)]
*  There will be guests who may be mentioned during the speech and members from both sides bring guests as well to make political points, but it's just remarkable to think about this political comeback. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=958.94s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=969.94s)]
*  Now this first address to a joint session after losing. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=970.94s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=975.94s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=977.94s)]
*  God Democrats, man. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=980.94s)]
*  I mean, look, look, Republicans are obviously insane and really lame. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=982.94s)]
*  But God damn dude, I guess like, I guess we can add that to the bipartisan consensus. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=987.94s)]
*  Okay. What do we have? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=995.94s)]
*  We got pedophilic elite. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=996.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=998.94s)]
*  Bipartisanship definitely is right there. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=999.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1003.94s)]
*  When you, when you talk about pedophilic elite and defending pedophilic elite, you got both sides that do a good deal of that. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1004.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1009.94s)]
*  American foreign policy, of course, is bipartisan support for Israel, which is, you know, American foreign policy, obviously also bipartisan. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1010.94s)]
*  And also now I would say aside from insider trading, that's a really good one. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1018.94s)]
*  Insider training is bipartisan. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1023.94s)]
*  And last but not least being unimaginably corny in different directions. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1025.94s)]
*  Weeks in, because remember for some of these voters, this is still a kind of second honeymoon period for the president. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1031.94s)]
*  He's only been in office 43 days. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1037.94s)]
*  I heard that again and again. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1039.94s)]
*  Give him a chance when it comes to prices, which matters so much to these voters, to all voters. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1040.94s)]
*  Give him a chance to try to bring those prices down. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1045.94s)]
*  I will tell you what I did here. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1047.94s)]
*  And it was fascinating. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1048.94s)]
*  One late thirties mom who backed President Trump in November. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1049.94s)]
*  She said, you know what I don't like though. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1053.94s)]
*  She said, I wish we could vote Elon Musk out of office. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1054.94s)]
*  She was concerned about what she saw is somebody who she viewed as out of touch, having so much influence at the White House. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1057.94s)]
*  Now, again, Elon Musk was there on the campaign trail. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1063.94s)]
*  It is not a surprise. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1066.94s)]
*  We have seen that over the course of the last nearly a year as he is in the room now in this chamber. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1067.94s)]
*  That's my president of those Doge cuts. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1074.94s)]
*  President Trump here is walking in and shaking hands. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1076.94s)]
*  But the optics here are different and they are fascinating because of that political content. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1079.94s)]
*  The fact that remember Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House as well. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1085.94s)]
*  And this is something that some members of Congress have been hearing about from constituents as they went back to their districts [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1089.94s)]
*  after this first period in Congress and they're hearing about it, Peter. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1095.94s)]
*  Wait, also not be like Donald Trump. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1099.94s)]
*  No, I'm a centrist. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1100.94s)]
*  This is unfolding. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1101.94s)]
*  And there is no better sign that someone is a centrist than wearing this hat. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1102.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1106.94s)]
*  I need, I will, I will respond to every single chatter that says I'm, I'm a fan of Donald Trump. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1107.94s)]
*  I'm just simply a centrist. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1113.94s)]
*  You might see me agreeing with virtually all of Donald Trump's policies and say he's based and he's pure content, but I'm actually an independent centrist. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1115.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1122.94s)]
*  Just so you understand. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1123.94s)]
*  I don't want you to make a mistake. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1124.94s)]
*  It's okay to make the mistake one time, but I will not entertain it a second time. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1125.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1130.94s)]
*  Just know that I am a centrist. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1131.94s)]
*  Yeah, I'm based on a base. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1132.94s)]
*  Military leaders. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1134.94s)]
*  He went in, of course it was a you're missing it. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1135.94s)]
*  You're not missing shit. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1137.94s)]
*  He's not joining chiefs of staff. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1138.94s)]
*  He's doing the rounds. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1139.94s)]
*  He's barely getting up there. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1140.94s)]
*  And then some of these town halls around the country right now, as the president shows up, there has been real dissatisfaction. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1141.94s)]
*  Critics say these are democratic opponents, but a lot of Americans are starting to feel the impacts as it hits their own community. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1146.94s)]
*  80% of American federal workers work outside Washington, D.C. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1153.94s)]
*  Let's listen to the president. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1157.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1158.94s)]
*  Luncheon today, so we can't talk about the substance of the conversation. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1159.94s)]
*  What we can talk about, I think he seemed relaxed. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1178.94s)]
*  He seemed very confident today. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1182.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1184.94s)]
*  Please. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1185.94s)]
*  Bro, I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1186.94s)]
*  They are glazing him at NBC News. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1187.94s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1189.94s)]
*  Lester, take it out of your mouth. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1190.94s)]
*  Take it out of your mouth. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1192.94s)]
*  And this looking forward to this speech tonight. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1193.94s)]
*  And once that, as he says, tell it like it is. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1194.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1195.94s)]

*  Whoo! [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1581.18s)]
*  Defend yourself, you've got a right to. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1583.18s)]
*  I thought you were a centrist. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1591.18s)]
*  Yeah, but I like the drama. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1593.18s)]
*  Mr. President, you can continue. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1595.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1598.18s)]
*  Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 executive orders [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1599.38s)]
*  and taken more than 400 executive actions a record [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1605.38s)]
*  to restore common sense, safety, optimism, and wealth all across our wonderful land. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1609.38s)]
*  The people elected me to do the job, and I'm doing it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1616.38s)]
*  In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1629.38s)]
*  it's our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1646.38s)]
*  By many. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1655.38s)]
*  And what makes it even more impressive is that, do you know who number two is? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1659.38s)]
*  George Washington. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1670.38s)]
*  How about that? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1672.38s)]
*  How about that? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1673.38s)]
*  I don't know about that list, but we'll take it. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1674.38s)]
*  Within hours of taking the oath of office, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1678.38s)]
*  I declared a national emergency on our southern border, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1681.38s)]
*  and I deployed the U.S. military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our country. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1685.5800000000002s)]
*  And what a job they've done. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1691.5800000000002s)]
*  As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1694.5800000000002s)]
*  Ever. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1702.5800000000002s)]
*  Are you posting like you're there? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1715.5800000000002s)]
*  I am there. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1717.5800000000002s)]
*  They heard my words and they chose not to come. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1718.5800000000002s)]
*  They let me in. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1720.5800000000002s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1721.5800000000002s)]
*  In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1723.5800000000002s)]
*  so thousands of illegal crossings a month, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1729.5800000000002s)]
*  and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1732.5800000000002s)]
*  and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1737.5800000000002s)]
*  were released into our country. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1741.78s)]
*  Who would want to do that? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1744.78s)]
*  This is my fifth such speech to Congress. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1746.78s)]
*  And once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1749.78s)]
*  and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1753.78s)]
*  or to make them stand or smile or applaud. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1758.78s)]
*  Nothing I can do. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1761.78s)]
*  I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1763.78s)]
*  a disease that would wipe out entire nations [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1767.98s)]
*  or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1771.98s)]
*  or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1775.98s)]
*  And these people sitting right here [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1780.98s)]
*  will not clap, will not stand, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1783.98s)]
*  and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1785.98s)]
*  They won't do it, no matter what. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1790.98s)]
*  Five times I've been up here. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1792.98s)]
*  It's very sad. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1794.98s)]
*  And it just shouldn't be this way. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1797.98s)]
*  So Democrats sitting before me, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1817.98s)]
*  for just this one night, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1820.98s)]
*  why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1823.18s)]
*  For the good of our nation, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1829.18s)]
*  let's work together and let's truly make America great again. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1831.18s)]
*  Classic. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1835.18s)]
*  This is a classic Trump moment right here. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1836.18s)]
*  Okay? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1839.18s)]
*  The whole, like, why don't we work together? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1841.18s)]
*  You guys just don't want to work with me [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1843.18s)]
*  in destroying the administrative apparatus. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1845.18s)]
*  Also, the saddest part about it [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1848.38s)]
*  is that the Democrats do want to work with him. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1850.38s)]
*  They always say, oh, if they came to us, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1852.38s)]
*  we would work on a bipartisan compromise. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1854.38s)]
*  America needs to bring a future that America deserves, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1856.38s)]
*  and we're doing it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1860.38s)]
*  This is a time for big dreams and bold action. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1862.38s)]
*  Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1866.38s)]
*  on all federal hiring, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1869.38s)]
*  a freeze on all new federal regulations, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1871.38s)]
*  and a freeze on all foreign aid. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1874.38s)]
*  Whoo! [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1877.5800000000002s)]
*  Fucking sick! [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1878.5800000000002s)]
*  No regulations! [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1879.5800000000002s)]
*  That's right! [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1881.5800000000002s)]
*  Fuck OSHA! [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1883.5800000000002s)]
*  I want to die at the construction site, sir! [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1884.5800000000002s)]
*  I withdrew from the unfair Paris climate [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1888.5800000000002s)]
*  a cleanest of dollars [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1891.5800000000002s)]
*  that other countries were not paying. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1893.5800000000002s)]
*  I withdrew from the World Health Organization. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1896.5800000000002s)]
*  Shut the fuck up, you sissy liberal. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1901.5800000000002s)]
*  And I also withdrew from the anti-American UN [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1903.5800000000002s)]
*  Human Rights Council. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1906.78s)]
*  We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1914.78s)]
*  that were making our country far less safe [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1917.78s)]
*  and totally unaffordable. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1919.78s)]
*  And importantly, we ended [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1922.78s)]
*  the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1924.78s)]
*  saving our auto workers and companies [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1929.78s)]
*  from economic destruction. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1932.78s)]
*  To unshackle our economy, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1936.78s)]
*  I have directed that for every one new regulation, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1939.78s)]
*  ten old regulations must be eliminated, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1943.78s)]
*  just like I did in my very successful first day. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1947.78s)]
*  I have also directed that [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1957.78s)]
*  the United States should be able to [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1959.78s)]
*  And in that first term, we set records on ending [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1961.98s)]
*  unnecessary rules and regulations [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1964.98s)]
*  like no other president had done before. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1967.98s)]
*  We ordered all federal workers to return to the office. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1970.98s)]
*  They will either show up for work in person [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1974.98s)]
*  or be removed from their job. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1977.98s)]
*  I have also directed that [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1984.98s)]
*  the United States should be able to [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1986.98s)]
*  I think it's gross that Congress claps for this [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1990.18s)]
*  because they notoriously hate showing up for the job. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1993.18s)]
*  Partially because they're all like 800 years old, but still. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1996.18s)]
*  The president is allowed to viciously prosecute [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=1999.18s)]
*  his political opponent, like me. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2003.18s)]
*  How did that work out? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2007.18s)]
*  Not too good. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2009.18s)]
*  Not too good. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2011.18s)]
*  Not too good. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2013.38s)]
*  And I have stopped all government censorship [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2027.38s)]
*  and brought back free speech in America. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2030.38s)]
*  It's back. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2033.38s)]
*  Except in this speech, he's going to reveal [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2035.38s)]
*  that he has a task force specifically dedicated [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2038.38s)]
*  to hurting Israel's feelings, by the way. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2040.38s)]
*  So, no, he has not brought free speech back. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2042.5800000000002s)]
*  A few days ago, I signed an order making English [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2044.5800000000002s)]
*  the official language of the United States of America. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2047.5800000000002s)]
*  La-mow. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2051.58s)]
*  Even people in his shadow life. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2055.58s)]
*  I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2057.58s)]
*  And likewise, I renamed for a great president, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2061.7799999999997s)]
*  William McKinley, Mount McKinley again. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2064.7799999999997s)]
*  Beautiful Alaska. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2073.7799999999997s)]
*  Love Alaska. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2075.7799999999997s)]
*  Love Alaska. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2077.7799999999997s)]
*  We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2079.7799999999997s)]
*  and the lack of diversity in the United States. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2082.7799999999997s)]
*  And I'm going to say that [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2085.7799999999997s)]
*  We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2087.98s)]
*  equity and inclusion policies all across [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2090.98s)]
*  the entire federal government [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2093.98s)]
*  and indeed the private sector and our military. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2096.98s)]
*  And our country will be woke no longer. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2104.98s)]
*  Yeah! Yeah! [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2108.98s)]
*  Fucking hell! No more woke! [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2110.98s)]
*  I guess they're playing bingo. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2113.98s)]
*  We believe that whether you are a doctor, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2116.18s)]
*  an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2119.18s)]
*  you should be hired and promoted [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2124.18s)]
*  based on skill and competence, not race or gender. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2126.18s)]
*  Very important. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2130.18s)]
*  You should be hired based on merit [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2139.18s)]
*  Merit. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2143.3799999999997s)]
*  And the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2144.3799999999997s)]
*  has allowed us to do so. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2148.3799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2150.3799999999997s)]
*  We have removed the poison of critical race theory [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2156.3799999999997s)]
*  from our public schools [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2159.3799999999997s)]
*  and I signed an order making it the [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2161.3799999999997s)]
*  official policy of the United States government [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2163.3799999999997s)]
*  that there are only two genders, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2166.3799999999997s)]
*  male and female. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2169.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm clapping IRL. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2173.3799999999997s)]
*  Meritocracy, baby. Common sense. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2175.3799999999997s)]
*  Just basic shit. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2177.3799999999997s)]
*  I also signed an executive order to ban men [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2179.3799999999997s)]
*  from playing in women's sports. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2183.3799999999997s)]
*  Bass! Oh my God. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2186.3799999999997s)]
*  Three years ago, Peyton McNair [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2193.3799999999997s)]
*  was an all-star high school athlete, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2195.3799999999997s)]
*  one of the best, preparing for a future [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2198.3799999999997s)]
*  in college sports. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2200.58s)]
*  But when her girls volleyball match [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2202.58s)]
*  was invaded by a male, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2204.58s)]
*  he smashed the ball so hard [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2206.58s)]
*  in Peyton's face causing traumatic brain injury. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2209.58s)]
*  Wait, what the fuck? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2212.58s)]
*  Why are you dunking on this random girl [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2213.58s)]
*  that's kind of fucked up? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2215.58s)]
*  And ending her athletic career. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2216.58s)]
*  It was a shot like she's never seen before. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2218.58s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2222.58s)]
*  Bro, chill. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2223.58s)]
*  Peyton is here tonight in the gallery [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2224.58s)]
*  and talking about the world. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2227.58s)]
*  And Peyton, from now on, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2229.7799999999997s)]
*  schools will kick the men off the girls team [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2231.7799999999997s)]
*  or they will lose all federal funding. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2234.7799999999997s)]
*  She's clapping. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2240.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to say anything. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2252.7799999999997s)]
*  I just got on band. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2254.7799999999997s)]

*  I'm not saying nothing. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2259.98s)]
*  And if you really want to see numbers, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2260.98s)]
*  just take a look at what happened [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2262.98s)]
*  in the women's boxing, weightlifting, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2264.98s)]
*  track and field, swimming, or cycling, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2266.98s)]
*  where a male recently finished a long distance race [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2268.98s)]
*  five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2272.98s)]
*  for a new record by five hours. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2277.98s)]
*  Record by five hours. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2280.98s)]
*  It's demeaning for women [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2282.98s)]
*  and it's very bad for our country. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2284.98s)]
*  We're not going to put up with it any longer. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2287.18s)]
*  What I have just described [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2305.18s)]
*  is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2307.18s)]
*  that is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2310.18s)]
*  Common sense has become a common theme. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2313.18s)]
*  And we will never go back. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2316.3799999999997s)]
*  Never. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2319.3799999999997s)]
*  Never going to let that happen. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2320.3799999999997s)]
*  Among my very highest priorities [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2325.3799999999997s)]
*  is to rescue our economy and get dramatic [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2328.3799999999997s)]
*  and immediate relief to working families. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2330.3799999999997s)]
*  As you know, we inherited from the last administration [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2333.3799999999997s)]
*  an economic catastrophe [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2337.3799999999997s)]
*  and an inflation nightmare. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2339.3799999999997s)]
*  Their policies drove up energy prices, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2342.58s)]
*  pushed up grocery costs, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2345.58s)]
*  and drove the necessities of life out of reach [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2347.58s)]
*  for millions and millions of Americans. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2350.58s)]
*  They've never had anything like it. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2353.58s)]
*  We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2355.58s)]
*  but perhaps even in the history of our country. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2358.58s)]
*  They're not sure. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2361.58s)]
*  As president, I'm fighting every day [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2363.58s)]
*  to reverse this damage [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2365.58s)]
*  and make America affordable again. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2367.58s)]
*  Cheers and applause [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2372.58s)]
*  Bro, what do you mean? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2383.58s)]
*  When is it going to become affordable? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2384.58s)]
*  Especially let the price of eggs get out of control. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2386.58s)]
*  Oh, he's blaming Biden! [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2389.58s)]
*  The egg price is out of control. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2391.58s)]
*  And we're working hard to get it back down. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2394.58s)]
*  Secretary, do a good job on that. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2397.58s)]
*  You inherited a total mess from the previous administration. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2399.7799999999997s)]
*  Do a good job. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2402.7799999999997s)]
*  A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2412.7799999999997s)]
*  is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2415.7799999999997s)]
*  The previous administration [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2418.7799999999997s)]
*  cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2420.7799999999997s)]

*  Even Admiral Goh's audience doesn't believe it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2425.7799999999997s)]
*  And closed more than 100 power plants. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2427.98s)]
*  We are opening up many of those power plants right now. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2430.98s)]
*  And frankly, we have never seen anything like it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2439.98s)]
*  That's why on my first day in office [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2443.98s)]
*  I declared a national energy emergency. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2445.98s)]
*  As you've heard me say many times, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2453.98s)]
*  we have more liquid gold under our feet [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2456.18s)]
*  than any nation on earth, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2458.18s)]
*  and by far. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2460.18s)]
*  And now I fully authorize [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2462.18s)]
*  the most talented team ever assembled [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2464.18s)]
*  to go and get it. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2467.18s)]
*  It's called Drill Baby Drill. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2469.18s)]
*  My administration is also working on [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2486.98s)]
*  a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2488.98s)]
*  among the largest in the world, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2492.98s)]
*  where Japan, South Korea, and other nations [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2494.98s)]
*  want to be our partner with [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2496.98s)]
*  investments of trillions of dollars each. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2498.98s)]
*  There's never been anything like that one. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2501.98s)]
*  It will be truly spectacular. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2503.98s)]
*  It's all set to go. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2505.98s)]
*  The permitting is gotten. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2506.98s)]
*  And later this week I will also take [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2508.98s)]
*  historic action to dramatically expand production [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2510.98s)]
*  of critical minerals and rare earths [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2513.98s)]
*  here in the USA. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2516.98s)]
*  To further combat inflation, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2531.98s)]
*  we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2533.98s)]
*  but will be ending the flagrant waste [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2535.98s)]
*  of taxpayer dollars. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2538.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2543.98s)]
*  And to that end, I have created [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2550.98s)]

*  Headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2786.98s)]
*  We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2789.98s)]
*  Trump can't read. He's reading right now, baby. He's reading. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2796.98s)]
*  He's reading the room. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2806.98s)]
*  We've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2808.98s)]
*  Taking back a lot of that money. We got it just in time. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2813.98s)]
*  This is the government accountability office. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2817.98s)]
*  The federal government office has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2821.98s)]
*  And we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2828.98s)]
*  We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2832.98s)]
*  in the Social Security program for our seniors. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2837.98s)]
*  And that our seniors and people that we love rely on. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2841.98s)]
*  Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2846.98s)]
*  from people aged 100 to 109 years old. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2852.98s)]
*  It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2861.98s)]
*  I don't know any of them. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2869.98s)]
*  I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2871.98s)]
*  3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2876.98s)]
*  3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2885.98s)]
*  3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2893.98s)]
*  And money is being paid to many of them. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2901.98s)]
*  And we're searching right now. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2904.98s)]
*  In fact, Pam, good luck. Good luck. You're going to find it. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2907.98s)]
*  But a lot of money is paid out to people because it just keeps getting paid and paid and nobody does. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2912.98s)]
*  And it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2919.98s)]
*  1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2923.98s)]
*  130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are aged over 160 years old. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2929.98s)]
*  We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2943.98s)]
*  Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2947.98s)]
*  One person between the ages of 240 and 249. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2970.98s)]
*  And one person is listed at 360 years of age. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2974.98s)]
*  By the way, some of this stuff has been corrected, like fact-checked and stuff, and people have described why they think that this is wrong and that they're operating on faulty data. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2979.98s)]
*  But it literally doesn't matter. It just does not matter. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2988.98s)]
*  I think it's just basically the goal now is basically just keep repeating it over and over again because lying is so OP. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=2994.98s)]
*  And they've realized that the dumbasses in the cult will absolutely eat it up. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3003.98s)]
*  We officially do not have any interest in the truth at all. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3010.98s)]
*  Ain't nobody is going to recognize that these people are just straight up lying. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3013.98s)]
*  And it sucks because I always talk about when the Democrats lie. Always. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3020.98s)]
*  But you will never, I will never expect a single fucking Republican, a commentator, independent centrist, okay, to ever turn around and be like, he's lying. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3024.98s)]
*  Like this is just straightforwardly not true. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3033.98s)]
*  For years, balance the federal budget. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3036.98s)]
*  We're going to balance it. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3039.98s)]
*  But aren't you a centrist? Yeah, I'm a centrist. And I'm saying this as a centrist. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3054.98s)]
*  As you can tell, I'm apolitical. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3058.98s)]
*  With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the gold card, which goes on sale very, very soon for five million dollars. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3060.98s)]
*  We will allow the most successful job creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3071.98s)]
*  It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3078.98s)]
*  And these people will have to pay tax in our country. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3084.98s)]
*  They won't have to pay tax from where they came. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3087.98s)]
*  The money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3090.98s)]
*  They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country instead of having them be being forced out. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3095.98s)]
*  Number one, at the top school, as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3103.98s)]
*  So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3114.98s)]
*  the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant hardworking job creating people. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3125.98s)]
*  They're going to pay a lot of money and we're going to reduce our debt with that money. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3138.98s)]
*  Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3154.98s)]
*  For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has rushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits and held back America's potential in every possible way. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3160.98s)]
*  The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3171.98s)]
*  Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead take 10 years, 15 years and even 20 years before you reject it. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3181.98s)]
*  Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3190.98s)]
*  My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy and we will restore true democracy to America again. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3196.98s)]
*  And any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3211.98s)]
*  Because we are draining the swamp. It's very simple. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3223.98s)]
*  And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3229.98s)]
*  And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pay its tax cuts to everybody that's in there waiting for you to vote. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3241.98s)]
*  I'm a centrist by the way. You call Elon a genius. An unelected genius. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3263.98s)]
*  I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3268.98s)]
*  So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3277.98s)]
*  But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3281.98s)]
*  Thank you. It's a very, very big part of our plan. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3298.98s)]
*  We had tremendous success in our first term with it. A very big part of our plan. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3301.98s)]
*  We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3305.98s)]
*  I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3314.98s)]
*  And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3339.98s)]
*  Yeah, chat. Don't write anything stupid in the chat. You will get banned. You will get instaclap. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3353.98s)]
*  And by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3359.98s)]
*  Where are these plans opening up? Where are the plans opening up? If there's any new plans that have opened up, it's directly a consequence of the Brandon administration's policies. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3366.98s)]
*  You've only been in office for like what? 30 fucking days? Get out of here. Absolutely. Boom. It's going to boom. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3375.98s)]
*  Spoke to the majors today, all three the top people, and they're so excited. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3380.98s)]
*  In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3385.98s)]
*  One of the largest anywhere in the world. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3396.98s)]
*  And this has taken place since our great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3411.98s)]
*  In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3426.98s)]
*  And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3435.98s)]
*  And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3445.98s)]
*  First turn, we had a great first turn. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3455.98s)]
*  If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3463.98s)]
*  Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3472.98s)]
*  On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3480.98s)]
*  And countless other nations charges tremendously higher tariffs. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3489.98s)]
*  I hate Trump, but I love when he says, have you heard of them about some of the most like, like everyone's heard of it things. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3493.98s)]
*  Like, yes, we've heard about China and Mexico and Canada. Thank you. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3501.98s)]
*  But we charge them and South Korea's is four times higher. That's right. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3507.98s)]
*  I love the rhetorical question joke. I know that's the joke. I love when he makes that joke in so many other ways. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3512.98s)]
*  I love it. But that's what happens. It's such a childish thing. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3518.98s)]
*  It's a grandpa joke to make. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3522.98s)]
*  The system is not fair to the United States and never was. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3524.98s)]
*  And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fools Day. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3527.98s)]
*  That's what that's not just one day was cost us a lot of money. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3537.98s)]
*  But we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3542.98s)]
*  April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3546.98s)]
*  That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3556.98s)]
*  If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3564.98s)]
*  then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3571.98s)]
*  It's a lot of that, too. They don't even allow us in their market. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3577.98s)]
*  We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3581.98s)]
*  I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3587.98s)]
*  They couldn't do anything about it. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3594.98s)]
*  We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth and we will not let that happen any longer. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3596.98s)]
*  Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3614.98s)]
*  But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3623.98s)]
*  and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3632.98s)]
*  Pop-Tart during Ramadan is all over the place. First of all, the sun has set already. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3638.98s)]
*  We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3641.98s)]
*  It's a protein pop-tart. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3648.98s)]
*  We will not let that happen any longer. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3650.98s)]
*  We will not do it any longer. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3652.98s)]
*  Thanks to our America First policies we are putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3659.98s)]
*  The combination of the election and our economic policies that people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3670.98s)]
*  announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3679.98s)]
*  Apple announced $500 billion investment. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3695.98s)]
*  Tim Cook called me. He said, I cannot spend it fast enough. It's going to be much higher than that, I believe. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3702.98s)]
*  They'll be building their plants here instead of in China. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3708.98s)]
*  And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount, 97% of the market, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3712.98s)]
*  announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on earth right here in the USA. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3723.98s)]
*  And we're not giving them any money. Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3743.98s)]
*  We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3748.98s)]
*  All that meant to them, we're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3754.98s)]
*  So they came and they're building, and many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3761.98s)]
*  We just want to protect our businesses and our people. And they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3766.98s)]
*  So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the Chips Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3773.98s)]
*  You should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3780.98s)]
*  Our new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3796.98s)]
*  Who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3804.98s)]
*  Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3813.98s)]
*  They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting, and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3825.98s)]
*  The tariffs will go on. Agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd. It may be a little bit of an adjustment period. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3833.98s)]
*  We had that before when I made the deal with China. $50 billion of purchases. And I said, just bear with me. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3844.98s)]
*  And they did. They did. Probably have to bear with me again. And this will be even better. That was great. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3850.98s)]
*  The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3857.98s)]
*  And we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it. And it hurt our farmers. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3863.98s)]
*  But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you too. I love you too. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3868.98s)]
*  It's all going to happen. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3878.98s)]
*  I love you. You're all going to lose so much revenue, farmers. My big, beautiful farmers. Just a period of adjustment. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3882.98s)]
*  Your families are going to starve. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3892.98s)]
*  If we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly won't have. We just won't have a country very long. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3895.98s)]
*  Here today is a proud American steel worker. Fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denaard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3903.98s)]
*  And a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3919.98s)]
*  Raised seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provided a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great Jeff. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3925.98s)]
*  Big dog clap for himself. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3938.98s)]
*  Thank you, Jeff. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3948.98s)]
*  Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs. They're about protecting the soul of our country. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3955.98s)]
*  Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening and it will happen rather quickly. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3965.98s)]
*  There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much. No, you're not. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3973.98s)]
*  And look and look where Biden took us. Very low. The lowest we've ever been. Jeff, I want to thank you very much. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3981.98s)]
*  And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3990.98s)]
*  A very loving person. Our magnificent first lady of the United States. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=3998.98s)]
*  Melania's work has yielded incredible results helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4011.98s)]
*  Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4030.98s)]
*  Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the first lady's fostering the future. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4034.98s)]
*  Does she get smacked in the head too, bro? What's going on? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4039.98s)]
*  To complete her education and become a teacher. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4042.98s)]
*  Some of these people that he brings on are so, it's just like you're dunking on them, you know? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4044.98s)]
*  Deep fake image produced by a peer with... [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4048.98s)]
*  Look at the timing of this article. 0.2% increase in defense spending. Uh oh. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4053.98s)]
*  And this is so important. Thank you very much, John. John Thune. Thank you. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4057.98s)]
*  Stand up, John. Thank you, John. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4062.98s)]
*  He's so weird. Thank you all very much. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4064.98s)]
*  He's so weird when he refers to people. He's so freaking weird when he talks about stuff. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4066.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4072.98s)]
*  Like he has no capacity to talk about people in an empathetic way. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4074.98s)]
*  Great job. It's odd, dude. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4078.98s)]
*  To criminalize the publication of such images online is terrible, terrible thing. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4080.98s)]
*  It's such a strange way to refer to humans, especially women. He does this a lot. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4086.98s)]
*  Signing that bill into law. Thank you. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4090.98s)]
*  And I'm going to use that bill for myself too, if you don't mind. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4092.98s)]
*  Because nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4095.98s)]
*  That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4100.98s)]
*  But if we truly care about protecting Americans' children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4104.98s)]
*  Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4113.98s)]
*  Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4117.98s)]
*  Because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies, they are now strongly embedded in our country. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4127.98s)]
*  But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4136.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4143.98s)]
*  And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi. I want to thank you and Paul of Border Patrol. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4153.98s)]
*  I want to thank you. What a job. They've all done. Everybody. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4159.98s)]
*  Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4162.98s)]
*  After. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4170.98s)]
*  Last year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student named Lakin Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4176.98s)]
*  That morning, Lakin was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4195.98s)]
*  Lakin was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then set loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4203.98s)]
*  It was indeed a failed administration. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4221.98s)]
*  He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4224.98s)]
*  With us this evening are Lakin's beloved mother, Allison, and her sister, Lauren. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4235.98s)]
*  Why is the dad not there? You know why. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4242.98s)]
*  Because the dad, I think it was the dad that said, please don't make my daughter's death political and use it as a cudgel against like migrants, right? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4254.98s)]
*  Last year, I told Lakin's proving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4262.98s)]
*  That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4272.98s)]
*  It's very strong, powerful act. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4286.98s)]
*  It's called the Lakin Riley Act. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4301.98s)]
*  So Allison and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Lakin Ryley. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4305.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4312.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4317.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4320.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4323.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4326.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4329.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4332.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4335.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4338.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4341.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4344.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4347.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4350.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4353.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4356.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4359.98s)]
*  It's a very powerful act. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4362.98s)]
*  Maria and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4365.98s)]
*  We must have legislation to secure the border. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4370.98s)]
*  But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4373.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4395.98s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4402.98s)]
*  He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals, and communities throughout the country. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4405.98s)]
*  Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4412.98s)]
*  Beautiful towns destroyed. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4423.98s)]
*  Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4426.98s)]
*  But there still is much work to be done. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4443.98s)]
*  Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nangere from Houston. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4448.98s)]
*  Wonderful woman. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4455.98s)]
*  Last June, Alexis's 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4457.98s)]
*  She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4464.98s)]
*  Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela, released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4471.98s)]
*  The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4483.98s)]
*  Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4491.98s)]
*  Earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4498.98s)]
*  One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4504.98s)]
*  By the way, Eliza Slotkin, Democrat's choice for responding to the State of the Union here, voted for the Lagan Riley Act. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4510.98s)]
*  If you want to understand where the Democrats are going with their future vision. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4519.98s)]
*  I have a sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4525.98s)]
*  Alexis, moments ago I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4532.98s)]
*  So, Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4542.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4555.98s)]
*  All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Lagan's murderers were members of the Mexican-Mexican drug lord [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4579.98s)]

*  When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4693.780000000001s)]
*  totally exposed, great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=4699.9400000000005s)]

*  Calm down. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5229.34s)]
*  By the way, I have the same shirt his dad has. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5235.34s)]
*  Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5238.34s)]
*  And DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer, actually a number of times. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5244.34s)]
*  The police love him. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5252.34s)]
*  The police departments love him. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5254.34s)]
*  And tonight, DJ, we're going to do... [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5256.34s)]
*  It's crazy he's using a little kid with brain cancer as a kid who wants to be a cop. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5258.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, he cut funding the cancer research. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5263.34s)]
*  Bro's like, you're the last one. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5271.34s)]
*  No one else is getting brain cancer treatment. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5273.34s)]
*  We've cut the funding. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5277.34s)]
*  DJ! DJ! DJ! DJ! [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5293.34s)]
*  Thank you, DJ. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5308.34s)]
*  DJ's doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5309.34s)]
*  From the vaccine! [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5316.34s)]
*  1975 rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5317.34s)]
*  Good thing we're deregulating. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5323.54s)]
*  This trend is one of the top priorities [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5324.9800000000005s)]
*  for our new presidential commission [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5327.82s)]
*  to make America healthy again. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5330.06s)]
*  Bro cut cancer research [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5332.22s)]
*  and he cut the regulatory agency budgets [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5335.14s)]
*  so that more children can get cancer [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5338.1s)]
*  and we can't find a cure for them. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5340.860000000001s)]
*  Hey yo, he's actively pointing to him. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5342.9800000000005s)]
*  He's like every child is gonna be like DJ, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5345.38s)]
*  but unlike DJ, they will not get a cure [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5348.34s)]
*  because we cut it. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5351.9400000000005s)]
*  With the name Kennedy, you would have thought [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5356.3s)]
*  everybody over here would have been cheering. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5357.86s)]
*  How quickly they forget. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5360.18s)]
*  Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5361.82s)]
*  poisons out of our food supply [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5365.34s)]
*  and keep our children healthy and strong. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5367.900000000001s)]
*  As an example, not long ago, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5371.14s)]
*  and you can't even believe these numbers, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5375.04s)]
*  one in 10,000 children had autism, one in 10,000, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5378.52s)]
*  and now it's one in 36. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5384.04s)]
*  There's something wrong, one in 36. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5387.2s)]
*  Think of that. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5389.32s)]
*  So we're gonna find out what it is [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5390.76s)]
*  and there's nobody better than Bobby [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5392.44s)]

*  My administration is also working to protect our children [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5405.4s)]

*  A few years ago, January, little John and her husband [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5411.759999999999s)]
*  discovered that their daughter's school [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5416.04s)]
*  had secretly socially transitioned [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5417.84s)]
*  their 13-year-old little girl. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5420.5199999999995s)]
*  Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5423.5199999999995s)]
*  and her husband while encouraging her daughter [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5427.24s)]
*  to use a new name and pronouns. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5429.84s)]
*  They, them pronoun, actually. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5433.8s)]
*  All without telling January, who is here tonight [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5436.64s)]
*  and is now a courageous advocate [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5439.6s)]
*  against this form of child abuse. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5441.88s)]
*  January, thank you. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5444.6s)]

*  Thank you. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5450.08s)]
*  Stories like this are why shortly after taking office, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5451.68s)]
*  I signed an executive order banning public schools [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5454.96s)]
*  from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5457.8s)]
*  I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5463.52s)]
*  to any institution that engages [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5469.04s)]
*  in the sexual mutilation of our youth. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5471.64s)]
*  And now I want Congress to pass a bill [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5482.64s)]
*  permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5484.92s)]
*  on children and forever ending the lie [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5488.8s)]
*  that any child is trapped in the wrong body. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5491.36s)]
*  This is a big lie. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5495.48s)]
*  And our message to every child in America [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5496.759999999999s)]
*  is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5506.5199999999995s)]
*  Unless God made you trans. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5514.16s)]
*  Unless God made you trans, then bye-bye. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5516.12s)]
*  Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5522.36s)]
*  and out of our military, and it's already out, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5525.32s)]
*  and it's out of our society. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5529.28s)]
*  We don't want it. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5531.2s)]
*  Wokeness is trouble. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5532.96s)]
*  Wokeness is bad. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5534.679999999999s)]

*  It's gone. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5537.4s)]
*  And we feel so much better for it, don't we? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5538.88s)]
*  Don't we feel better? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5541.48s)]
*  Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5542.56s)]
*  They will be fighters and warriors. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5551.4400000000005s)]
*  They will fight for our country. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5553.240000000001s)]

*  the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5578.16s)]
*  in 15 years, and that all armed services [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5581.08s)]
*  are having among the best recruiting results ever [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5584.32s)]
*  in the history of our services. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5588.12s)]
*  What a difference. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5590.599999999999s)]
*  And you know it was just a few months ago [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5591.76s)]
*  where the results were exactly the opposite. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5603.24s)]
*  We couldn't recruit anywhere. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5605.96s)]
*  We couldn't recruit. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5608.04s)]
*  Now we're having the best results [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5609.76s)]
*  just about that we've ever had. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5613.12s)]
*  What a tremendous turnaround. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5614.68s)]
*  It's really a beautiful thing to see. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5617.4s)]
*  People love our country again. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5619.92s)]
*  It's very simple. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5621.28s)]

*  Jason's father, grandfather, and great grandfather [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5644.76s)]

*  but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5845.0s)]
*  It will have a huge impact. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5848.12s)]

*  The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5879.56s)]
*  not for others, but others could use it. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5883.96s)]
*  Not for people in Panama. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5885.84s)]
*  But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5887.8s)]
*  Thirty-eight thousand workers died building the Panama Canal. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5891.12s)]
*  They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5896.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not a nice place to work. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5900.04s)]
*  They paid them very highly to go there, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5902.72s)]

*  It was given away by the Carter administration for $1, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5917.12s)]
*  but that agreement has been violated very severely. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5921.28s)]
*  We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5924.8s)]
*  and we're taking it back. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5928.5199999999995s)]

*  Now, we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5948.12s)]
*  Now, Marco has been amazing, and he's going to do a great job. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5952.88s)]

*  You know, he was approved with actually 99, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5960.76s)]
*  but the 100th was this gentleman, and I feel very certain. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5963.08s)]
*  So let's assume he got 100 votes, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5967.96s)]
*  and I'm either very, very happy about that [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5970.28s)]
*  or I'm very concerned about it. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5972.4s)]
*  But he's already proven. I mean, he's a great gentleman. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=5975.4s)]

*  Steve, go cut. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6197.72s)]
*  Wittkopf, my goat. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6199.160000000001s)]
*  And now we're going to build on that foundation [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6200.68s)]
*  to create a more peaceful and prosperous future [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6218.96s)]
*  for the entire region. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6221.92s)]
*  A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6223.12s)]
*  People have been talking about that so much lately [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6224.88s)]
*  with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6228.04s)]
*  But a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6231.200000000001s)]
*  It's a rough neighborhood. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6233.400000000001s)]
*  A lot of things. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6234.64s)]
*  I'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6236.04s)]
*  Millions of Ukrainians and Russians [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6240.96s)]
*  have been needlessly killed or wounded [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6242.92s)]
*  in this horrific and brutal conflict. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6245.52s)]
*  With no end in sight, the United States has sent [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6248.04s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6252.52s)]
*  With no security, with no anything. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6258.76s)]
*  Do you want to keep it going for another five years? [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6275.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you would say Pocahontas says yes. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6278.64s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6281.64s)]
*  Two thousand people are being killed every single week. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6293.4400000000005s)]
*  More than that. They're Russian young people. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6297.360000000001s)]
*  They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6301.12s)]
*  But I wanted to stop. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6304.240000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6306.4800000000005s)]
*  buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6309.12s)]
*  By far. Think of that. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6314.16s)]
*  They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6316.24s)]
*  than they have defending. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6319.28s)]
*  And we've spent perhaps $350 billion, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6321.76s)]
*  like taking candy from a baby. That's what happened. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6326.16s)]
*  And they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6329.76s)]
*  And we have an ocean separating us. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6334.28s)]
*  And they don't. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6337.92s)]
*  But we're getting along very well with them and lots of good things are happening. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6339.599999999999s)]
*  Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6344.24s)]
*  by billions and billions of dollars. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6349.5199999999995s)]
*  It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6353.16s)]
*  at some point, come on, let's equalize. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6355.92s)]
*  You've got to be equal to us. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6357.839999999999s)]
*  That didn't happen earlier today. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6359.679999999999s)]
*  I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6361.88s)]
*  The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6367.12s)]
*  as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6371.04s)]
*  Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians, he said. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6375.36s)]
*  My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6378.84s)]
*  to get a peace that lasts. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6384.28s)]
*  We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6387.2s)]
*  maintain its sovereignty and independence [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6391.719999999999s)]
*  regarding the agreement on minerals and security. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6394.76s)]
*  Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6397.44s)]
*  I appreciate that he sent this letter just got it a little while ago. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6403.64s)]
*  Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6408.44s)]
*  and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6412.68s)]
*  Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6416.16s)]
*  Wouldn't that be beautiful? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6424.12s)]
*  It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6439.4s)]
*  It's time to end this senseless war. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6443.76s)]
*  If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6446.68s)]
*  Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6450.4s)]
*  a history teacher named Mark Fogle was detained in Russia [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6453.959999999999s)]
*  and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6458.44s)]
*  Rough stuff. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6462.36s)]
*  The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6463.919999999999s)]
*  They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6468.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6471.5199999999995s)]
*  But last summer, I promised his 95 year old mother, Malfine. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6472.599999999999s)]
*  She looks great for 95, by the way. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6477.48s)]
*  God damn. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6479.679999999999s)]
*  Back home. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6480.639999999999s)]
*  After 22 days in office, I did just that. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6482.56s)]
*  And they are here tonight. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6486.0s)]
*  God damn. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6488.8s)]
*  Bro, get her a job in Congress. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6495.88s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6497.88s)]
*  She looks sprier than half of Congress, dude, at 95. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6499.360000000001s)]
*  Gam-gam. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6504.120000000001s)]
*  Social Security fraudster in five years. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6508.200000000001s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6511.56s)]
*  We're going to cut our Social Security so good. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6520.84s)]
*  To Mark and his great mom, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6526.240000000001s)]
*  we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6527.76s)]
*  As fate would have it, Mark Fogle was born [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6532.96s)]
*  in a small rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6536.68s)]
*  Have you heard of it? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6541.12s)]
*  Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6542.48s)]
*  I just happened to be 13th for a rally. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6547.76s)]
*  That was not pleasant. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6552.04s)]
*  And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6554.92s)]
*  I walked onto that stage. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6559.96s)]
*  And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6562.92s)]
*  And I never did, did I? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6567.28s)]
*  Never forgot. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6568.76s)]
*  Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6570.76s)]
*  gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6575.76s)]
*  unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6580.2s)]
*  into a crowd of many thousands of people. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6583.4800000000005s)]
*  My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6586.76s)]
*  but some were not so lucky. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6590.16s)]
*  Corey Comparator was a firefighter, a veteran, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6593.76s)]
*  a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6597.6s)]
*  and above all, a protector. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6601.400000000001s)]
*  When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6604.6s)]
*  it was a horrible sound. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6607.6s)]
*  Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6609.68s)]
*  He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6614.280000000001s)]
*  and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6618.08s)]
*  Corey was hit really hard. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6623.200000000001s)]
*  You know the story from there. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6626.4s)]
*  He sacrificed his life to save theirs. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6628.4s)]
*  He's so weird, dude. He cannot. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6630.799999999999s)]
*  He cannot talk about this shit normal. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6633.48s)]
*  But thankfully, Corey was hit really hard like country doctors. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6636.639999999999s)]
*  There's something wrong with him. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6641.5599999999995s)]
*  And they were saved. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6643.2s)]
*  So those doctors had great talent. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=6644.08s)]

*  I told you he was wrapping it up, dude. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7022.0s)]
*  I know his... [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7023.96s)]
*  I know his speech patterns. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7024.96s)]
*  ...concluding what we believe is the longest speech of this type. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7026.96s)]
*  Major Congress... [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7031.4400000000005s)]
*  A political is always a good speech. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7034.4400000000005s)]
*  He became president tonight. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7036.84s)]
*  Well, I'll let the... [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7038.32s)]
*  I'll let Lester Holt do the talking in that regard. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7040.32s)]
*  ...moment so that many would agree probably weren't helpful, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7043.16s)]
*  including those protests we saw early by some Democratic members. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7048.36s)]
*  That's the unhelpful part, the Democrats protesting. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7052.599999999999s)]
*  ...at the request of the speaker. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7056.28s)]
*  And the president talking about his agenda, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7059.639999999999s)]
*  talked about the tariffs that, of course, have just gone into effect this week. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7061.639999999999s)]
*  Wrap it up. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7065.0s)]
*  It's certainly doubled down on that strategy. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7066.0s)]
*  It said they indicated there would be more to come. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7069.16s)]
*  Talked about foreign policy, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7072.639999999999s)]
*  and it appeared that he is ready to move forward with Ukraine, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7074.4s)]
*  but talked a lot about Ukraine and Russia [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7078.36s)]
*  and getting a peace deal, something that is very much at the top of mind. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7081.72s)]
*  And then a lot of the cultural issues, a lot of time spent [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7085.400000000001s)]
*  on some of the more controversial federal programs that he says [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7089.12s)]
*  his Department of Government efficiency is cutting. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7093.56s)]
*  So a wide-ranging and, as mentioned, the longest speech ever [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7096.4800000000005s)]
*  in the State of the Union or a joint address. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7100.4800000000005s)]
*  So he now holds the top spot there. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7102.400000000001s)]
*  Just go to Kristen Welko for your thoughts. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7104.88s)]
*  Savannah, I was struck by the fact that after that rocky start [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7106.8s)]
*  when Congressman Al Green was removed for jeering at him, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7110.96s)]
*  this really became a speech about cultural issues, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7116.44s)]
*  a culture war speech, if you will. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7120.16s)]
*  And he spent about 20 minutes on it. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7122.12s)]
*  It took him 20 minutes to talk about the top issue for voters, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7123.64s)]
*  which is, by the way, the economy. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7126.08s)]
*  He also talked about immigration, the environment, government censorship, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7128.68s)]
*  all of those things. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7131.96s)]
*  A couple of headlines. You talked about tariffs. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7133.0s)]
*  That's obviously a huge issue because there's a lot of concern [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7136.04s)]
*  among some Republicans that the tariffs that he's imposed against [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7138.92s)]
*  Mexico and Canada and China could drive up prices. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7141.84s)]
*  He acknowledged, quote, there will be a little disturbance [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7144.76s)]
*  and it will require a little adjustment. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7147.72s)]
*  That is significant. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7150.12s)]
*  That's the furthest that he's ever leaned into that. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7151.28s)]
*  On foreign policy, he announced that the top terrorists responsible [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7153.84s)]
*  for the Abbey Gate bombing is being flown to the U.S., [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7157.16s)]
*  is going to face justice. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7160.52s)]
*  And notably on Ukraine, I thought that was one of the biggest headlines [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7162.4s)]
*  of the night after that explosive Oval Office meeting. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7165.64s)]
*  The president seeming to indicate some progress has been made. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7170.120000000001s)]
*  President Zelensky sending him a note indicating he wants to make his move forward [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7174.4400000000005s)]
*  on that in a little bit, which is seen as the first step. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4KDGUJEV9k&t=7178.68s)]
