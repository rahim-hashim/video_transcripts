**HasanAbi:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4)
*  or I guess they're doing, they're playing fast and loose. They're trying to dupe you. We got [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=0.0s)]

*  at the table. They haven't even brought it to Iran at all. All right. We got that done. We covered [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=10.64s)]
*  that us investments to a Fox news word right now, present breaking. Trump confirms us Iran [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=22.32s)]
*  nuclear deal proposal. Trump is heading back to the United States after wrapping up his [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=29.52s)]
*  historic trip to the Middle East and the, I'm going to get to, I am going to get to the soy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=34.0s)]
*  right as well. Don't worry. Oh yeah. The world can always get worse, but this kind of horrifying [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=38.72s)]
*  plan most likely will not come to pass. If it does, the Libyan government in Tripoli would be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=44.72s)]
*  signing what amounts to his death warrant in the eyes of the country's people. When Libya's foreign [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=47.84s)]
*  minister in 2023 was revealed to have spoken to the Israeli foreign minister once there was such [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=52.56s)]
*  concern for her safety in that climate that she was forced to flee the country. This did not happen [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=57.04s)]
*  with the foreign ministers of the UAE or Bahrain. The news while flying home on board air force one [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=61.44s)]
*  revealing the U S has given Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal. Okay, here we go. Lucas [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=67.68s)]
*  Thomas joins us from Abu Dhabi with the latest Lucas. What do we know about the deal? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=72.8s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, that's right. President Trump making news aboard air force one, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=80.32s)]
*  departing the United Arab Emirates moments ago, concluding his three nations swing here in the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=84.16s)]
*  Middle East. The president is confirming that the U S has given Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  We still don't know the details of that, but here's the quote from the president moments ago. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=94.88s)]
*  He said, they have a proposal speaking about Iran, but more importantly, they know they have [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=99.44s)]
*  to move quickly or something bad is going to happen. And part of that bad going to happen is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=104.72s)]
*  right here in the United Arab Emirates where the United States keeps some of its fast moves, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  F 15s, F 16s. But let's talk about the good news. This trip commerce, not conflict. That's been the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=113.36s)]
*  president's theme. And we have the receipts right here. Saudi Arabia first stop on this trip, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=119.12s)]
*  pledging over $600 billion in U S investment. Qataris pledging $243.5 billion as well as at [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=124.0s)]
*  7 47 and freeing E Don Alexander. And right here in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, the Emiratis are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=132.0s)]
*  pledging 200 billion in commercial deals. And they also said that's going to go to $1.4 trillion [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=138.96s)]
*  over the next decade. And let's not forget the captains of industry, the business leaders that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=145.12s)]
*  have come here to the Middle East. They didn't have to. And last night, UAE's foreign minister [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=149.36s)]
*  sat down with their own Brett bear about what the president's visit meant to his country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=153.68s)]
*  We've been investing in the United States for decades, but now we're taking it one step further, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=158.72s)]
*  not only in terms of size, but in terms of trust. And we're grateful for president Trump for that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=163.36s)]
*  After arriving, they're not mad about Trump, Muslim ban or Steve Miller and the administration. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=173.12s)]
*  That's so funny, dude. Listen, I don't know if you know this, but they don't even give a shit [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=177.52s)]
*  that Israel is currently doing an campaign. No, they don't give a dude. They're rich as hell. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=183.52s)]
*  The people in these places do care, but these guys don't. You need to understand these are [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=190.8s)]
*  monarchs. Like through and through, we're talking about monarchs, okay? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=198.24s)]
*  They're kings. And no, the kings don't care when they're happy to continue getting money, funds, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=205.36s)]
*  weapons from the American king, Donald Trump. If anything, they like Trump more than previous [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=214.72s)]
*  administrations, because at least previous Western administrations would at least present [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=220.96s)]
*  themselves as though they were above. There is this like, there is this, this elitist mentality [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  that prior administrations demonstrated over and over again, that this one does not. This one openly [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=232.4s)]
*  flaunts its monarchy style structure. This is exactly the type of guy that these dudes know [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=240.08s)]
*  how to deal with and deal with very well. Trump touring the grand mosque with his shoes on the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=248.0s)]
*  president, UAE closing the mosque for the first time ever guys. Now there are other international [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=253.44s)]
*  issues looming. Of course, it's Ron. Last night on hand, the secretary of state Marco Rubio talked [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=258.72s)]
*  to Sean about Iran, not far from where I'm standing about a potential deal of its nuclear program. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=263.36s)]
*  He says this offer won't be around forever. And what he means by that is at some point, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=269.2s)]
*  decisions will have to be made about more maximum pressure and other options, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=273.52s)]
*  because Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=277.52s)]
*  So it's really secretary of state Marco Rubio confirming to Sean Hannity that that offer had [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=282.0s)]
*  been proposed saying this offer won't be around forever. Now here's the tallest building in the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=286.24s)]
*  world, the Burj Khalifa lit up in the stars and stripes, a symbol of unity and solidarity. One [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=290.48s)]
*  more image Trump earlier today visiting the Abrahamic house in that's home. I've seen a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=295.6s)]
*  lot of talk about how the US nuclear US Iran nuclear proposal is happening. Yeah, I don't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=300.48s)]
*  know why this is here is the foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has not received [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=306.56s)]
*  any written proposal from the United States, whether directly or indirectly. In the meantime, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  the messaging we and the world continue to receive is confusing and contradictory. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Iran nonetheless remains determined and straightforward. Respect our rights and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  terminate your sanctions and we have a deal. Mark my words, there is no scenario in which [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=324.48s)]
*  Iran abandons his hard earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes, a right afforded to all [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  other MPT signatories to the great Iranian nation has shown its power and fortitude in the face [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  of those who have attempted imposition. We always welcome dialogue based on mutual respect and always [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  reject any diktat. And the question you asked is, is it appropriate to wear shoes in a mosque? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=346.88s)]
*  No, it is inappropriate to wear shoes in a mosque chatter to a church, synagogue and mosque, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=352.96s)]
*  which speaks to the tolerance of this country, including coed gyms here at the hotel. A different [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  story though, across the Persian Gulf in Iran. Here's president Trump earlier. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  I should have left yesterday, but I couldn't disappoint you. Your father would have been [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  extremely upset with me and you would have been more upset. He would have understood. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=380.16s)]
*  We had such a beautiful evening and they planned it so beautifully. I said, I'm going to have to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  wait just a little bit. But the way we were treated by your family, the way we were treated by [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=391.36s)]
*  Qatar, Saudi Arabia and others is just been so very proud to be representing the United States [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  of America. And thank you all for being here and media. Thank you very much. You've been very fair. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=409.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=413.6s)]
*  Like it is, it's so funny. It's like, it's like claiming that you arrived at a deal with Russia. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=418.8s)]
*  Okay. Because you went on a tour and you got hyped up from Estonia and Poland. Like that is [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  the analog here. Claiming that you are facilitated and secured a deal with Iran, a denuclearization [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=436.64s)]
*  agreement with Iran. When you haven't talked to Iran and you've went to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=442.32s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, especially directly in conflict with Iran until recently, as a matter of fact, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=449.28s)]
*  is like saying, oh, I went to Poland and Russia is going to finally do a ceasefire. We did it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=454.88s)]
*  It. We went to Estonia. We went to Poland. We went to Finland. He's just lying. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  What the or I guess they're doing, they're playing fast and loose. They're trying to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=469.84s)]
*  dupe you. We got click baited. Trump confirms us Iran nuclear deal proposal as in there's going [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=474.4s)]
*  to be a proposal at the table. They haven't even brought it to Iran at all. So the president, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  they're talking about the full diplomatic and military honors. He's received not only here in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=485.84s)]
*  the United Arab Emirates, but also in Saudi Arabia and in Qatar. We remember the F-15s, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=490.4s)]
*  escorting Air Force One, not only to Saudi Arabia, but again to Qatar and then respectively from [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  their countries here, the United Arab Emirates. And we just saw fighter jets escorting Air Force [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  One out of the UAE, but full diplomatic and military honors, full pomp and circumstance, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=506.32s)]
*  wherever the president goes, bestowing honors, that very rare honors that these leaders could [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  muster and have ever given out. And no question that success, the business success, commerce, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=516.32s)]
*  not conflict. That's been the theme of this trip. As the president wraps up his first official [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=521.2s)]
*  overseas trip. You're watching Fox News, brother? No, it's important to watch Fox News. Again, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=525.2s)]
*  watching Fox News is important. Sometimes even watching Asmongold is important. And the reason [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  for why is because these guys, whether we like it or not, are speaking to millions of people. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=535.36s)]
*  And millions of people are just that stupid. And it's important to get where they're getting [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  their notes from. It's important to understand what kind of talking points you're going to see [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=547.04s)]
*  out in the wild, where those talking points are materializing. Since beginning his second term [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  here, not only to the United Arab Emirates, but also Saudi Arabia and Qatar, guys. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  It's incredible. What a great trip. Thank you so much, Lucas. You get to come home soon. Look at [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  this. This is the cover of the New York Post this morning. It says, shake it up. And in this little [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=567.12s)]
*  box, it says President Trump announced nearly two trillion in deals with Mideast countries, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=571.04s)]
*  lifted sanctions on Syria, pushed for a new Iran deal, an onslaught that left some former Biden [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=574.56s)]
*  officials jealous. Quote, it's amazing what can be accomplished when the president isn't brain dead, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=579.12s)]
*  one said. And the breakdown is just extensive. When you look at 200 billion plus in commercial [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=584.16s)]
*  deals between the U.S. and the UAE, then you got 243 billion in economic deals between the U.S. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  and Qatar. And then you got 600 billion committed from Saudi Arabia to invest in the United States. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  And one thing that they're doing differently than they did the last time is they're making [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=602.48s)]
*  sure it's happening in the four year period. The president is aware of what happened the last time [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  where he got out of office and then people didn't keep their commitments. Of course, the Palantir [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=611.44s)]
*  CEO went on a trip with Trump and so did Elon Musk. They also want to force American security [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  contracts into these countries. They want Palantir to be working within these countries so they're [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=623.6s)]
*  easily fucking traced so they can surveil these nations better. And in the short term, it's [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=627.76s)]
*  beneficial for Saudi Arabia to have Palantir because they think, oh, we'll just use Palantir [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=633.44s)]
*  against political dissidents in the country and easily fucking stop them from gaining momentum. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=638.24s)]
*  What they fail to recognize is that that is a way for America to have a back door into all [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=643.28s)]
*  surveillance in the country, even more than they currently do. That's it. And the same goes for [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=648.32s)]
*  Elon Musk. They want Starlink to be everywhere. Why do they want Starlink to be everywhere? I think [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=654.0s)]
*  the reason why they want Starlink to be everywhere is so that they can have broad surveillance [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=659.2800000000001s)]
*  capabilities all around the planet. Okay, Starlink is, make no mistake, a defense contractor. Your ISPs [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=663.2s)]
*  have incredible amounts of data that they're collecting from you. Okay, incredible amounts, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=670.6400000000001s)]
*  data that you can't actually hide with a VPN even. Starlink is an internet service provider [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=676.48s)]
*  in that regard. This is America's, this is the United States of America's role in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  implementing mass surveillance around the planet. Get the ink there dry and say, hey, you got to do [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=690.48s)]
*  this timely and very quickly. And Brian, look at that. That's what he accomplished in a matter [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=699.12s)]
*  of a few days. That's jobs. When I see that, I see all these deals. Those are jobs here in America. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=703.84s)]
*  Right. And they are going to build, they're looking to get a lot of power because they want to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=709.6s)]
*  develop AI. And with them, they had the who's who of AI executives with them from Elon Musk to Sam [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  Altman, really conducted by David Sachs, who's well connected in the area. And they have a lot [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=719.76s)]
*  of defense contracts. I thought it was fascinating in Saudi Arabia. They're going to spend, they want [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  $600 billion worth of defense. And they're spending the contracts across various companies [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=728.96s)]
*  to make sure they get it. So I just wonder if that helps Secretary Hegsted's budget. So if he's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=734.16s)]
*  trying to get a trillion, okay. But if he's selling a lot of it, shouldn't those profits go to, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=739.68s)]
*  I don't know, maybe allowing them to work it against the invoices, you know, in order to get [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=745.68s)]
*  that trillion. You sell off, you can make a profit from this at the same time. We build up our defense. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=753.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, Marco Rubio is making it clear. I want all our allies to start spending 5%, including [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=758.72s)]
*  5% of their budget on military spending. So he wants our allies to step up. He wants our tech [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFUrNKtuz4&t=764.4s)]
