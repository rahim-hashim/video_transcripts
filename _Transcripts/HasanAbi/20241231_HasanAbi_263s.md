# Response To The Bradley Martin Interview | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM)
*  Was Bradley receptive to what you had to say slash your conversation? Yes. Bro lives in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=0.0s)]
*  LA and has never seen a Pana. I have not. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=4.38s)]
*  Okay. Bradley Martin clips popping off already. I know I'm unique in this and people get mad [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=11.08s)]
*  at me for even saying this, but like I don't have a problem paying taxes. It sucks that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=29.38s)]
*  like it goes to I don't know a big chunk of it and not to fix in the pot holes. But at [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  the end of the day, even if a percentage of it is going to the teachers, if a percentage [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=42.26s)]
*  is going to the schools, then I'm like, yeah, you got to do that. And I think that that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=45.66s)]
*  is unfortunately, that's not a very commonly held perspective because so much of our taxes [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=52.78s)]
*  go to like irrelevant it that only benefits the corporations and you know, the super [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=59.22s)]
*  wealthy. That's the really big overarching thing is like, how do we ever fix something [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=66.74s)]
*  that is just so money driven? I mean, it's just, you know, even this conversation about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=73.06s)]
*  the visa, it's about being able to get the wage here to have leverage of the people that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=77.22s)]
*  are, you know, needing to be here at that certain wage have to do it because if they [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=81.14s)]
*  don't, they got to go back home. They also make way more money here than they would there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=84.7s)]
*  So then it makes sense for the corporations to be like, yeah, of course we want that guy [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=88.38000000000001s)]
*  because we can pay him less. Any he like has to do the same job. He's doing more. He damn, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=91.78s)]
*  there's so many clips already out. That's crazy. I wish it was like Sweden where we [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  pay more taxes, but get a lot of stuff free, like college public transportation. I've said [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=102.06s)]
*  a thousand times with my tax dollars went to healthcare and education. So the military [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=104.9s)]
*  pay like doubling taxes. I think people on both sides of the aisle can agree on this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=107.42000000000002s)]
*  taxes are theft. I I'm I know I'm unique in this and people, but yeah, there's hopefully [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=110.62s)]
*  some clips. Hopefully some good clips will come out of this. We'll get mad at me. Did [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=117.06s)]
*  you do your best? Yeah. Performance and honor Legos birthday was Bradley receptive to what [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=121.98s)]
*  you had to say slash your conversation. Yes. Bro lives in LA and has never seen a panaderia. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=126.78s)]
*  I have not. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=131.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=132.98s)]
*  Okay. And she'll get me busy. Oh my God. The country that produces the most bread in the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=133.98s)]
*  world by 4 million tons. Well, us bakes the most bread. Germany exports more bread in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=148.62s)]
*  any other country. But the country that eats the most bread is Turkey. Right? I'm pretty [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  sure. I think it's like Turkey. It's Balkans, right? The U S however, only spent 2.4 billion [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=162.14s)]
*  worth items abroad. Panaderia is why we're going to export bread. It asked you to go [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  to the mob as a resident Mexican chatter. I'm gonna have to revoke your Mexican card [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=173.94s)]
*  after that bread is a bread like straightforward bread. Okay. Like this type of bread is really [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  important. I can beat Tokyo in breed bread eating contests all day, but y'all aren't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=186.14s)]
*  ready for that combo. I found out my family goes back to Hungarian Jews, my Ottoman brother. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=190.66s)]
*  Let's go see me then Pitta are goaded. Okay. I don't know why I'm diving into all this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=195.34s)]
*  slow news day, huh? No, we just, we just got started chatter. We'll do the Bradley Martin [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=202.38s)]
*  interview when it's like fully uploaded and I'll react to it. It's like is long, but I [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=208.74s)]
*  think it's a pretty good combo overall. Hopefully his audience is receptive to it. Well, I had [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  tuned in and I saw Hassan making sense here. And I had the guy Hassan lives in a gated [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=219.66s)]
*  community. Why does Bradley have a wrist on important LeBron birthday? Tick-tock. Okay. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=224.38s)]
*  We're done with LeBron birthday. I did that yesterday. Okay. Don't even start me thoughts [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  on Gretchen Whitmer. I have no thoughts on Gretchen Whitmer. What is your rest days? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=232.78s)]
*  Do you do push, pull legs break? No, I was doing full body splits this time around, but [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=236.38s)]
*  I've actually on from full body splits. We're going to go back to upper body, push, pull [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=241.38s)]
*  lower body, push, pull. And that's what we're doing. Is the audio even playing or am I tripping? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=247.26s)]
*  No, I haven't been playing the audio is muted. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt-zMSttEM&t=254.26s)]
