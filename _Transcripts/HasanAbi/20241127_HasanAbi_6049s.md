**HasanAbi:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM)

*  Sure. Fair. I say himbo, but damn. Okay. It's not piker. Welcome back. Um, it's good to be back. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=57.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me after my conversation with whoa, you're being no, I was just, I saw [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  you clocked them. You clock them immediately. It's on you'll hear my conversation with Seth [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=66.56s)]
*  Molten. We talked about the democratic party. We talked about the controversy over his comments [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=72.16s)]
*  around trans athletes also on the feed right now. You can hear Dan's conversation with [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=77.28s)]
*  Jenna, Mally, Dylan, Quentin, folks, David pluff and Stephanie cutter about what went wrong in the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=82.0s)]
*  Harris campaign. We're having a bunch of conversations about, uh, what we learned from the election, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=86.88s)]
*  where we go from here with a bunch of different voices. One of which is here today. People are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=92.16s)]
*  mad that we talked to the Harris campaign. People are mad. We're talking to you. People are mad. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  And that's okay. Yeah. But let's start with this. It was big tent. It's a, it's a big tent. It's a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=100.0s)]
*  big tent. It's got Cheney in it. It's got Hassan piker in it. Yeah. It's got Dan Osborne in it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=104.64s)]
*  Got Seth Molten in it. Yeah. Yeah. You know, tent shouldn't maybe feature Cheney in it, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=111.36s)]
*  but you know, everybody else we can, I can have a conversation with. Great. Great. All right. Now [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=116.48s)]
*  look, the main pastime on the left, other than being mad for the last few weeks is everyone [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=120.4s)]
*  saying how right they were all along about Democrats being out of touch and bound to lose. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=123.12s)]
*  We don't have subtitles ready to be available yet. I'm Jon Lovett and guest hosting with me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=127.2s)]
*  Okay. Nevermind. I was wrong. I think like the most program because of I think a month before. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=131.52s)]
*  All right. Now look, this time on the left, other than being mad for the last few weeks, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=138.0s)]
*  is everyone saying how right they were all along about Democrats being out of touch and bound to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=141.2s)]
*  lose. Arrest me. Sorry. So we had a, I sat at this chair. Well, maybe not at this chair, but I had [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  the offline interview with, with Jon, I think a month before the, the election and a lot of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=152.32s)]
*  the things, a lot of the concerns that I brought up to him, it seemingly came across as somewhat [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=159.44s)]
*  prescient or people, people went back to the, to the footage and I've been seeing comments that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=164.72s)]
*  were rather positive about like, you know, okay, he said a lot of stuff there that was objectively [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=169.28s)]
*  correct. Seeming. Yeah. Let's, I want to talk about one aspect of that, which is that you were [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=173.44s)]
*  saying, others were saying that, Hey, like Trump going on Rogan, Trump going on Theo Vaughn, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=177.6s)]
*  like something is happening here and we need to understand it. We need to address it. It's, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=183.76s)]
*  it's real. And I remember like my experience, it's like seared in my mind of, of Trump being [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=188.4s)]
*  on Joe Rogan because of how like my path of understanding it, because what I saw first [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=193.2s)]
*  were a bunch of people taking clips and saying, wow, Rogan really didn't like Trump. Trump, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump is a mess on this show. He comes across terribly. Rogan was like, like kind of, um, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=204.56s)]
*  giving Trump space to hang himself rhetorically. And then I watch it and like Trump did great in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=210.48s)]
*  this interview. Yeah. He's very telegenic. That's the thing that like a lot of people, I guess, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=215.28s)]
*  refuse to factor in for some weird reason is that, yeah, he, he definitely rambles on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=219.12s)]
*  He likes to call it the weave. And even Joe Rogan made fun of him for that a little bit in the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  process. But like, there is something to be said about a relatively telegenic person who is able [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=227.04s)]
*  to portray himself as, I like to call it honestly dishonest, where like everybody knows he's a bit [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=234.0s)]
*  of a scumbag, but he's your scumbag. And he's able to get that across to a lot of people. And, and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=238.56s)]
*  I don't think that there is really anyone with that level of television presence on the Democratic [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=244.8s)]
*  party front. I think like the most skilled order in the Democratic party's ranks in the last, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=251.36s)]
*  you know, last couple of decades was obviously Barack Obama. And, and outside of that, I think [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=257.12s)]
*  like in a lot of instances, purely from optics point of view, Democrats track is like technocratic, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  elitist, too, too serious about everything that they talk about. And there's certainly a lot of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=267.2s)]
*  that on the Republican Party side as well. And we've seen failed initiatives from establishment [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=272.72s)]
*  Republicans that try to recreate the Trump phenomenon with the likes of Ron DeSantis. And [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  that was a massive failure. But ultimately, I think this goes beyond podcasts. This is something that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=281.6s)]
*  I've been talking about quite frequently. I know the podcast thing is like the most like that's the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=286.8s)]
*  one that got everyone's attention. But I said this on CNN last night, that you can't really podcast [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  your way out of this problem. Like having, you know, there was that one tweet saying like, oh, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=296.8s)]
*  we just have 100 pots of americas, but they all have to look like Hassan. Like that's not, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=300.96s)]
*  that's not how this works. Oh, you think that one that one tweet might have been wrong, but the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=305.12s)]
*  Yeah, like I guess. So I agree with that. You know, it became this couple kind of like, I don't know, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=309.44s)]
*  like, why are we in the same shirt? I don't know, dumbass. Think about it. Maybe it's because I [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  filmed this this morning before I started the stream. Stop asking stupid questions, Chad. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=318.64s)]
*  She had this devastating loss to Trump. And everybody's looking for these little explanations [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  that all feel like, they just feel silly, like, oh, we need a Joe Rogan on the left. And even [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=327.76s)]
*  saying, like, I don't even want to talk about how stupid that is anymore, because even that has [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=332.56s)]
*  become stupid. But I'm like, I do agree that like people are like, oh, well, she should have gone [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=336.48s)]
*  to Rogan. All right. Yeah, sure. I think so too. That would not have changed the outcome of this [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=340.08s)]
*  election. There's a larger problem to what you're getting at, which is like, why don't we have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  figures and where like, we think they would do great on that show. And why is someone like Joe [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=346.4s)]
*  Rogan now who was four years ago, open to Bernie now suddenly open to Trump, like that's the deeper [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  problem. Like you look at like successful Democratic messengers or progressive messengers [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=356.8s)]
*  over the last like decades and you think, all right, well, Bill Clinton obviously was successful [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=360.8s)]
*  and he like ran against the Democratic Party in some way. Barack Obama did the same thing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=365.2s)]
*  Bernie does the same thing. AODC does the same thing. Not on, I'm not talking about on policy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=369.76s)]
*  You don't mean like also in the same direction of running? No, no, no, no. But running against [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=373.6s)]
*  the establishment in some way. And just saying, and the reason I connect them is because they all [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=377.12s)]
*  did something which is demonstrated that they were not part of the Democratic establishment, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=381.84s)]
*  both like on policy and rhetorically, right? Tim Poole's hairline, they give it a 25, get this up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  That's what they all did. Level two hype train. And I'm just wondering like what, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=391.2s)]
*  like the one place where I know you like find, you know, there's a place where there's like kind [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  of an alignment of like the Seth Moulton critique of the Democratic Party and the lefty critique [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=400.4s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, which is just like, it's annoying and like kind of, I don't know, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  pedantic in some way. It's an incorrect interpretation, an incorrect autopsy to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=410.24s)]
*  look back at a thing that the Democratic Party did not do at all. And then say it's actually [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  that reason. It's not anything that we did so far. It's not that we tacked to the right over [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=418.56s)]
*  and over again, despite people like myself and many others saying like, don't do this, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=422.72s)]
*  you're going to hemorrhage the base, you're going to hemorrhage the base of support, you are going [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=426.0s)]
*  to cut away at your turnout, you're going to cut across many different constituencies that you rely [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=428.8s)]
*  on to create an effective coalition. And it's a very dangerous gamble to assume that you can [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=433.76s)]
*  decouple a lot of these people in the suburbs, a lot of like white women specifically away from the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=440.4s)]
*  Republican Party and vote for you instead. I know that they're high propensity voters, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=444.88s)]
*  but it doesn't matter. There's still plenty of low propensity voters that you have to rely on to win. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=448.48s)]
*  And that's precisely what the Democratic Party did. They hyper focused on these key constituencies, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=452.4s)]
*  despite the fact that polls were seemingly deadlocked after $30 million of ad spend in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=457.84s)]
*  key suburbs. Right? Like it showed, at least I said this time and time again, it showed someone [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=462.96s)]
*  from the outside looking in that the message was not working and you can have the best ground game [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=468.0s)]
*  possible. You can have, you know, hundreds of thousands of people all across the country [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=472.4s)]
*  door knocking. But if the top down message that you're communicating is not resonating with people, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  then you're not going to be able to win an election. You're not going to have the effective [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=481.2s)]
*  turnout necessary to win this election. And that is precisely what happened. Now, does that mean [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  that Trump's messaging was good? Of course not. It wasn't. It was actually pretty bad. And I would [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  even go so far as to say the anti-trans ads were actually a distraction and not good. It was only [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=491.76s)]
*  effective in the DC bubble, I think, and the consultant bubble and the media class that saw [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=496.4s)]
*  those ads and were like, oh my God, this is an incredible ad. Like they really ruined Kamala [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  Harris. Kamala Harris had a silly answer to an ACLU questionnaire. Okay. That just shows that she [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=505.12s)]
*  is not the most experienced politician. This was all the way back in, I believe, 2020, right? She [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=509.84s)]
*  literally had to drop out of the primary anyway. At that time, that's one thing. Okay. But that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=513.92s)]
*  should not be a campaign killer. If you personally think that that's a campaign killer, then your [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=519.52s)]
*  campaign is weak. This message across the board should never be able to end a single campaign. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=523.12s)]
*  Then Teflon Don is real. I mean, the man had the grab him by the pussy come out as the October [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=528.4s)]
*  surprise in 2016 and he still won. And since then there's been a litany of different controversies, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  including, but not limited to straight up undermining American democracy by doing 36. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=537.12s)]
*  And yet people are still voting for him. And one must ask the question, why? And I think overall, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  the same exact problems that persisted in 2016 when the economy was seemingly very good, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=547.76s)]
*  right? Especially as opposed to like the post COVID economy and its recovery. People were still [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=552.16s)]
*  very frustrated with what was going on. The notion that in the wealthiest nation on earth, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=557.12s)]
*  we have 600,000 people sleeping outside every night. The idea that I think we should send [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=561.68s)]
*  every single person in the work camps and every single person in my chat, which I assume is coming [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=566.72s)]
*  from discord. Sorry. Every single person in discord and every single person in my chat right [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=572.48s)]
*  now that is coming from discord. That's like, I bet you're drinking Coke right now in that glass [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=576.0s)]
*  and not iced coffee to work camps. We should do that. We, you guys need to, you know, you need [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=581.52s)]
*  to get the work. Okay. You're done. You're done. We need to urge the freaks this quarter right now. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=587.6s)]
*  What the fuck is this? You know, we have a, we have the concept of medical bankruptcy is an insane [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=593.36s)]
*  phenomenon that doesn't exist in any other OECD nation. Like the, the fact that what? 40% of the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=597.92s)]
*  American public or 60% of the American public doesn't have $400 in emergency spending. Like [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=602.4s)]
*  these are all very real economic anxieties. I'm using that term specifically because you know, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=606.4s)]
*  it's a, it's one thing that people like to hyper-focus on that, that creates volatility, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=611.04s)]
*  that creates instability and it creates a base of angry people. And if the democratic party is not [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=615.12s)]
*  addressing that anger and addressing their material problems and earnestly telling them like, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=622.4s)]
*  we're going to fix that shit. Okay. And the other side is looking at that anger and saying, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=626.4s)]
*  we're going to channel your anger. You have every right to be angry and you know who you should be [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=630.88s)]
*  angry at? Those who have less than you. You know, you should be angry at the working poor, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=633.84s)]
*  the homeless people that are doing crimes left and right, black and brown people, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=638.08s)]
*  undocumented migrants that are doing incredible amounts of crimes. They're killing hundreds of [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=641.6s)]
*  thousands of Americans and trans people. And, and the democratic party only cares about those people. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=645.36s)]
*  They don't care about you. And that message resonates with a base of support, not because [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=649.28s)]
*  they are intrinsically evil. That message resonates with the base of support because they're angry. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=653.92s)]
*  And one of the two major parties is not even remotely interested in addressing that anger [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=659.12s)]
*  and trying to tell them what the solution to that anger actually is and what the real problem is. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=664.48s)]
*  So I want to like break that into kind of how we like the democratic brand, how we message and all, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=669.68s)]
*  but then, but also like on the policy front. So Joe Biden wins. He tries to kind of build consensus [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=675.28s)]
*  with Bernie. He brings in AOC. He goes to the left on antitrust. He does the inflation reduction [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=682.8s)]
*  act. He does a post COVID relief bill. He canceled as much debt as he can legally, even though the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  court is trying to stop him. Like I, before the last year, like what my view of this was, is Joe [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  Biden, this consensus Democrat, right? Actually to the right of the consensus for most of his career, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=704.8s)]
*  somebody had to be kind of pulled to where the party was going, did something extraordinary, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  which is he adapted, he changed. He governed in a much more progressive way than I expected, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=712.88s)]
*  I hope that you expected. Oh, absolutely. And it seems as though like he, and that like, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  whether it's because people didn't feel it or people didn't believe it or the way Democrats [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=723.76s)]
*  talk about policy is ineffective, like it didn't seem to matter in terms of how people viewed [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=728.88s)]
*  the democratic response to the economy, right? They were so angry about inflation. They were [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=734.16s)]
*  angry about a bunch of other issues and it really didn't matter what Joe Biden said, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=737.44s)]
*  what Kamala Harris said, they were held responsible. I'm just wondering what, how you explain that, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=741.36s)]
*  right? Like it seems as though Joe Biden tried to listen to this exact critique and it didn't matter. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  So yes and no. I do agree. There are plenty of things that Joe Biden did, like beefing up the NLRB [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=749.84s)]
*  and letting the FTC rain hell upon these monopolies. There's two issues there though. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=755.44s)]
*  One is I think something that you will agree with as well, that the Democrats don't campaign year [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=763.44s)]
*  round in the same way that Republicans do on key issues. And they do have a massive communication [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=766.8s)]
*  problem that could potentially be solved by having a more robust ecosystem and more collaboration [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=770.56s)]
*  with even the likes of yourself and maybe even someone like myself as well. And they need to [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=776.4799999999999s)]
*  always be on, they need to always be counter messaging against the anti-immigration sentiment. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  I went back and looked at my commentary from February of 2021 when the story of the Customs [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=784.56s)]
*  Abortor Patrol Haitian migrants getting whipped by, you know, horseback Customs Abortor Patrol [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  people officers was in the news. And I remember talking about how the Republicans are going to [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=793.6s)]
*  keep hitting the immigrants are doing crime note over and over again, because that's the one thing [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=797.9200000000001s)]
*  that they have. And it's built around a complete falsehood that undocumented migrants are responsible [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=802.08s)]
*  for incredible amounts of crime. It's not correct. There is no data to suggest this. The data actually [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  shows the exact opposite. Undocumented migrants are your neighbors. They contribute to the economy [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  in very meaningful ways and they very rarely take anything in return. Why is the Democratic party not [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=814.64s)]
*  pushing this counter narrative? And they never did. Instead of pushing that counter narrative, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=818.88s)]
*  which is based in truth and talk about how undocumented migrants are responsible for less [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=822.08s)]
*  crime per capita than natural born. I was on Fox. US citizens are for what? For CNN having me on [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=825.76s)]
*  talking about the Joe Rogan of the left or that fentanyl being trafficked across the US borders [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=831.76s)]
*  are actually not coming in the knapsack of a otherwise law abiding abuela, but instead it's [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=835.84s)]
*  coming from regular points of entry trafficked by American citizens. 90% of the people that are [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=840.32s)]
*  being apprehended for chemical compounds necessary for fentanyl or direct drugs that they're [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=845.84s)]
*  trafficking across the border are American citizens. Like this is, this does not track [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=850.88s)]
*  with the narrative that people believe because the narrative is dominated by the right on this [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=856.24s)]
*  issue. They should have been counter messaging against that and they should have been, they [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=860.56s)]
*  should have been putting bills forward in defense of the moves that for example, Governor Greg Abbott [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=863.92s)]
*  was engaging in in Ronda Santis. I said this even back then that this is a actually a fantastic [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  opportunity for the federal government to show that there is a more tolerant approach that one, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=874.48s)]
*  they should have immediately pursued Governor Greg Abbott legally and arrested him for human [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=878.72s)]
*  trafficking and tried to prosecute him for human trafficking. I don't care if it's a constitutional [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=883.52s)]
*  crisis or not. All of this stuff was insanely messed up and the federal government dropped the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=886.4s)]
*  ball. I think the Biden administration dropped the ball by not adding additional funds immediately, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=890.4s)]
*  sending additional funds immediately to places like Chicago and New York and to figure out a [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=893.76s)]
*  better way to transition a lot of these people and integrate them into the American labor force. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=897.52s)]
*  And instead they just got stuck in this like legal limbo for no reason. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=903.44s)]
*  So why is it that okay, so Republicans say they sort of lay all these problems at the feet of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=906.64s)]
*  undocumented immigrants. They say they're responsible for crime. No, they're not. But [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  there are obviously undocumented people. There are people and some are committing terrible crimes, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=916.24s)]
*  which they then exploit. But for the most part, these are people that not only are committing [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=919.6s)]
*  crimes at a low rate, but actually are unable to go to the police when they're victims of crime. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=922.08s)]
*  Whether that's a domestic violence, they can't go to the police or whether that's just sort of the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=924.96s)]
*  quotidian mayhem of living in America or a boss taking advantage of you. They can't go to the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=930.0s)]
*  police. Right. Then they say, oh, well, they don't pay taxes. Actually, that's not true. They pay [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=934.0s)]
*  into Medicare, they pay into Social Security, and they don't get the benefits of it back. And [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=936.7199999999999s)]
*  then they say, well, they're driving up the cost of housing. I do not believe that undocumented [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=939.76s)]
*  people are the reason a house costs $450,000 where you just cost $350,000. Yeah, I didn't realize [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=944.88s)]
*  there were executives at BlackRock. The Guatemala migrants are mass purchasing houses and making [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  sure that everyone was a permanent renter. That's the point though. But it's not a trans person. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  That's your landlord. It's not an undocumented immigrant. That's your landlord. That's raising [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=958.64s)]
*  the cost of rent. It's not your manager is not an undocumented immigrant. There are two big problems. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=961.2s)]
*  One is there are a lot of people saying this and, and it doesn't break through because there is this [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  right wing media system. Is that man drinking Starbucks right now? Hey, notice how I'm not an [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=969.76s)]
*  anti-social weirdo and didn't actually yell at him over that. And then nuke the entire conversation. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  You should probably also follow suit. Here's a lesson for many of you in the chat. Many young, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=982.0s)]
*  like-minded individuals who want to be activists. Okay. It's called be normal. That's how it works. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=988.4s)]
*  That puts out this one story. And the second problem is like Democrats really don't have trust on [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=996.3199999999999s)]
*  this issue with the people that they're trying to persuade to see it are wet, which I think goes to [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1002.64s)]
*  the point you made before, right? Which is why is it that Donald Trump can meander around the country [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1007.52s)]
*  rambling, committing what in any other era would be if not like campaign ending like camp. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1011.1999999999999s)]
*  There's an argument that a lot of people are defending immigrants and it's just the right [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1017.04s)]
*  way making this narrative is such cope. Wait, what do you mean? No, no one is defending immigrants. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1019.5999999999999s)]
*  That's the problem. Campaign harming a ridiculous state. Pick your battles. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  Probably a better way to put it. No, be normal and pick your battles. You're right. Pick your battles, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1028.48s)]
*  but also be normal. Be normal is very important. Gaffer that, that he can basically be an [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1032.08s)]
*  like a strategic mess. But Kamala Harris has to hit every point exactly right. She, she, she, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1038.8s)]
*  she says the wrong thing on the view or there's a bad interview from 2020. Those things can be [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1045.44s)]
*  campaign ending. And I think to your point, it goes to something deeper, kind of a lack of that, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1049.36s)]
*  like kind of, I don't know, core vision or, or, or motivating mission for the current Democratic [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1054.0s)]
*  party. Yeah. Something that is an understandable, easy to communicate, simple policy that you can [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1059.44s)]
*  put your campaign around. So, so we agree on the messaging front a little bit, at least, or the, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1065.84s)]
*  the asymmetry of how much, you know, right-wing media dominates the, the ecosystem, the media [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1070.48s)]
*  ecosystem in general, all the way from independent outlets down to traditional media, where as far [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1075.2s)]
*  as I understand it, 73% now, I think of all news watchers are watching Fox news, 73%. That's an [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  insane percentage. That's an insane number. Right. So outside of that though, I think here is the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1085.3600000000001s)]
*  disagreement that we will have that while Joe Biden did a bunch of stuff that I agree was positive, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1091.44s)]
*  uh, it was simply not enough. And, uh, that was something that I was always very critical on as [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1096.56s)]
*  well. Uh, if you see a homeless person and you chuck them two pennies, uh, and they're, you know, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1101.76s)]
*  they're sitting on the corner of the street, like, yeah, technically their, their material wealth [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1105.28s)]
*  improved by a percentage, a decent percentage, but he's still going to be mad at you because [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1110.56s)]
*  you just gave him two pennies. Why doesn't the homeless person understand that their situation [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1114.56s)]
*  is much better? That is not, that is not an effective way to communicate to Americans that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1118.08s)]
*  like, no, you don't understand inflation is actually under control, that the economy is [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1122.0s)]
*  rebounding even if it's objective truth, because they, like most Americans don't understand what [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1125.44s)]
*  inflation is and they don't understand that prices are not going to go down in that, in that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1129.28s)]
*  circumstance. And besides that, and I, and in fact, this is not just the vibe session communications, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1133.6000000000001s)]
*  but I'm also talking about specifically like even the IRA or many of these other, uh, many of these [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1140.0s)]
*  other, uh, like parts of the legislative agenda that, uh, that Biden put forth that was more [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1145.04s)]
*  progressive than I expected from more progressive than even the Obama administration in many respects, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1150.8s)]
*  but, um, one, they didn't do a good job of communicating any of those victories in my [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1154.56s)]
*  opinion. They did not, they, they did not actually like go to the media regularly to, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1158.96s)]
*  to show these victories and to showboat and gloat a little bit to a lot of that was also held up in [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1162.96s)]
*  gridlock because we didn't whip votes well enough within, uh, within our own party. And I think that [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1167.2s)]
*  there was a lot of punishments that should have been dished out to the likes of Joe Manchin and [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1172.72s)]
*  the likes of Kirsten Sinema rather than, uh, offering a green Senator, uh, an opportunity to, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1175.84s)]
*  to be a prominent fixture of the democratic party. Uh, I think that a lot more punishments [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1180.8s)]
*  should have been issued towards these people that use the moment in the spotlight to specifically [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1185.04s)]
*  play the role of a rotating villain in the democratic party, which has happened time and [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1189.52s)]
*  time again, all the way from Joe Lieberman to the Maggie Hassans of the world, the Kirsten Sinema, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1192.1599999999999s)]
*  the Joe Manchins of the world, and the problem solvers caucuses, uh, within the, uh, within [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  Congress in general, um, these guys need to, these guys need to get whipped into shape. Um, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1201.44s)]
*  Yeah, I just, like, I wish, I wish I believe that. I just wish I believe that. Like, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1206.0s)]
*  but I just, like, I don't know how much more you could have gotten out of Joe Manchin or, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1210.0s)]
*  or Kirsten Sinema. Like Joe Manchin basically was telegraphing the whole time. Like, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  like I'll walk away and Joe Biden kept him in the tent that got judges through. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1219.12s)]
*  Like Austin, I'll fight you if you order food from a BDS listed place. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1222.7199999999998s)]
*  Why are you trying to trigger people in the fucking discord sitting over there [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1227.6s)]
*  within striking distance? It's motherfucker, bro. He like literally sat his sad as down over there. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1231.6799999999998s)]
*  And actually, like, I just, I do not believe, like, I, I think we agree on a lot. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1237.6s)]
*  I just don't believe that there is a version of the Joe Biden presidency that could have been [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1242.32s)]
*  more successful on legislative policy. I just, I don't see that. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1245.84s)]
*  You're not going to appreciate what I'm about to say then. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  Hit me. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1250.08s)]
*  Use the IRS and also the SEC and maybe even the FTC to investigate as to why Joe Manchin's brother [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1251.12s)]
*  owns a coal mine and whether there's a conflict of interest there. Um, investigate why Joe Manchin's [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  daughter is, uh, is selling pharmaceutical products to the state of West Virginia when Joe Manchin is [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1262.3999999999999s)]
*  directly at odds with, uh, you know, any sort of bill that passes, uh, that, that, uh, would lower [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1267.12s)]
*  the cost of a pharmaceutical. So you want the president to politicize these agencies and use [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1271.84s)]
*  them to go after people. Because you want to know why. Tell me why. Hey, tell me why. Because [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1276.1599999999999s)]
*  they're doing it at the behest of, of, uh, not only the American people, their interests, but they're [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1279.4399999999998s)]
*  also, and this is probably going to frustrate everyone in this audience, but here's, here's [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  the thing that I get a wide range of listeners across broad ideological spectrum. Here's, here's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1286.6399999999999s)]
*  what really frustrates me about the way the democratic party operates. They love norms, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1290.0s)]
*  they love institutions, they love civility, they, they care about bipartisanship for the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1294.96s)]
*  sake of bipartisanship as though that is something that some do, some don't. Yeah, sure. But for the [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1298.88s)]
*  most part, the broad communication coming out of the democratic party is that these are the things [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1302.8s)]
*  that they care about. These are the top line issues. We're going to protect democracy. We're [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1306.24s)]
*  going to preserve our institutions. The problem is the other side doesn't give a shit about that. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1308.4s)]
*  So I think I want a democratic party that fights for me and others who are marginalized, other [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1312.16s)]
*  people that like desperately need help. And I know that the Republican party is never going to do [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1317.04s)]
*  that. I'm not one of those guys who's like, Oh, well, you know, at least I, at least the Republicans [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1320.4s)]
*  are kind of listening to what I have to say or, or are, you know, communicating, channeling the [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1323.84s)]
*  anger that I feel like I don't care. They're, they're charlatans. They're significantly worse [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1328.3999999999999s)]
*  than the democratic party. I don't like the democratic party for their closeness to the [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1331.04s)]
*  Republican party. I want them to be a party that actually fights for the working class, for all [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  Americans unconditionally, regardless of ideology. And you can't do that through bipartisanship with [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1338.48s)]
*  an otherwise like hostile entity that is the Republican party. And I think there is a lot [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1343.4399999999998s)]
*  of hypocrisy there and the, and hypocrisy that people can see hypocrisy is the easiest thing [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1349.12s)]
*  that they can understand. You can't say that these guys are fascist. These guys are racist for eight [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1353.6s)]
*  years for wanting to build a wall and then turn around and straight up tell Anderson Cooper in [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1357.12s)]
*  that town hall. Well, maybe the wall is a good idea and I want to build it myself. I'm going to [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1360.8s)]
*  be the borders are maybe the border party. You can't do that. Americans look at that and go, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1363.84s)]
*  so you're admitting that you were just lying for the past eight years. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1368.08s)]
*  Well, it's like, again, that's like, I think actually you look at somebody like Dan Osborne, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1370.48s)]
*  right? Who ran so far out of the democratic party ran as this economic populist. But one of the [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1375.28s)]
*  things he had to do to get there was kind of be tough on immigration. And actually like, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1379.28s)]
*  I think part of it goes back to like, if people felt like they knew, like in their bones, like, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1384.3999999999999s)]
*  like Bernie Sanders being to me, like the signal example, like, you know, what Bernie's about, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1389.6s)]
*  you know, what he's for, you know, what motivates him, you know, what he cares about, same thing for [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1393.2s)]
*  Trump, you know, like, you know, when there are issues, isn't gonna fuck about and there's issues [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1395.6s)]
*  he really, really cares about immigration is when he trade, right? Like, you know, the things that, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1398.24s)]
*  like, that have been anti-crime, whatever, that there are things that have been in Donald Trump's [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1401.76s)]
*  like kind of brain slowly losing plasticity that are like kind of solid in there. And for Bernie, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1406.0s)]
*  you know, like we know why he's in politics and that gives a politician the space to kind of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1410.72s)]
*  challenge orthodoxies in the party or kind of run counter to it to signal to the people you need [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1415.36s)]
*  to signal to now, like, you know, you say, oh, you can't, you can't call them fascist and then also [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1420.16s)]
*  work with them. Like, yeah, yeah. But at the same time, Joe, again, like it's like, I just don't [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1425.6s)]
*  know what to do with this nuance. Joe Biden, like, I am glad Joe Biden did the Inflation Reduction [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1430.16s)]
*  Act and an infrastructure bill and a gun bill and the Chips Act and a bunch of other stuff. I'm [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1433.84s)]
*  glad he was able to do all of those things. I'm glad that he was able to use his kind of like [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1438.32s)]
*  moderate brand, whatever, to kind of bring people in and get some stuff done. Like, I don't think [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1442.8s)]
*  the country is better off if he didn't do those things. So like you describe it as hypocrisy, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1447.12s)]
*  like it's compromised, like it politics requires compromise. The Republican party rarely ever [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1451.52s)]
*  compromises. They're uncompromising. You only have to beat them. But that's not true, though. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1456.8s)]
*  I agree with that on Trump, but that's just not true. Like they did compromise, right? They like [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1460.88s)]
*  these are there. There are plenty of people on the Republican side that were furious at Republican [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1464.88s)]
*  senators for going along with some of these Biden bills, right? Like those are people that did [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1468.24s)]
*  compromise. Yeah, there is a million examples, however, of Republicans that are obstructionist [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1471.92s)]
*  that I'm sure you also love presenting that go back to their town halls and lie about all the [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1475.68s)]
*  money that they brought back home from the bills that they voted against. So ultimately, we now [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1479.0400000000002s)]
*  know that political polarization is set in a way that never really existed in American history [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1483.0400000000002s)]
*  until the last couple of decades. Right. I think that parties originally were more [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1489.04s)]
*  geopolitically focused on their immediate needs, like statewide needs. So you saw you saw this [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1493.84s)]
*  dramatic shift. And now the Republican Party, especially with Mitch McConnell, under the Obama [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1499.12s)]
*  administration, showcase that like permanent obstructionism is not punishable. And that [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1502.8799999999999s)]
*  gridlock is always considered the the the administrative party's problem. If there's any [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1508.24s)]
*  sort of gridlock, it's the fault of the leadership. And Americans hate gridlock. Yeah, that's kind of [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1512.8s)]
*  the reason why I was talking about Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, because that was a massive, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1516.4s)]
*  massive moment where like, they actually ended up protecting the Republican Party because they were [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1519.44s)]
*  never going to vote for these bills. Positive America has a negative impact on our polity, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1525.2800000000002s)]
*  prove me wrong. OK, dude, again, going back to pick your battles and be normal. I know we're [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1528.96s)]
*  supposed to be civil, but he's so casual about immigration, anti-crime, i.e. killing innocent [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1534.88s)]
*  civilians, innocent people. Like, first and foremost, OK, I don't think it's appropriate [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1538.0s)]
*  to assume that the Podjons are in favor of, you know, killing migrants. OK, that's not correct. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1545.52s)]
*  Number two, OK, I talk to people who are infinitely more disagreeable than the Podjons on a regular [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1554.4s)]
*  basis. OK, and I offer them the same charity when I have a normal conversation with them, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1563.44s)]
*  a normal discussion with them. There are polite disagreements in this conversation that spanned [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1569.92s)]
*  over two hours. OK, you need to calm the fuck down. The job here is not to own my interlocker [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1577.12s)]
*  in the marketplace of ideas. Like, I do not consider the Podjons to be my enemy. OK, especially [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1586.0s)]
*  when they are offering a platform to someone such as myself and being rather kind, allowing me to [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1595.76s)]
*  talk my shit. OK, calm down. Anyway, and now the entire conversation was about, like, you know, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1604.0s)]
*  madness within the Democratic Party's caucuses. Like, oh, they can't get their ducks in a row, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1609.6s)]
*  right? Like, that was genuinely frustrating to me because it's like if you don't, if you'd whip [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1613.52s)]
*  your votes immediately, then you could showcase that the Republican Party is standing in the way [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1617.12s)]
*  of progress. But that's just like, that is legislative minutia. What is more important to [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1620.4s)]
*  talk about is broad sweeping legislative changes or a agenda that might even come across as bold [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1624.24s)]
*  and radical in the interest of the American working class. Joe Biden said he wanted to do [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1630.8s)]
*  the public option. Everybody knew that wasn't real. He never talked about it after he just [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1635.52s)]
*  used the public option. He slotted that in in the primaries when the party was primed to the Bernie [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1639.6s)]
*  left and everyone was like, you know, trying to communicate their own populist version of what [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1643.92s)]
*  Bernie was doing. And, you know, Joe Biden won the primaries and effectively tabled the discussion [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1649.12s)]
*  about health care. This is still a major problem regardless. Like, yes, pharmaceutical prices and [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1654.9599999999998s)]
*  ensuring that insulin prices are capped to thirty five dollars, which is now going to be looking [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1660.56s)]
*  like a Trump victory when he's in office. It doesn't matter. It's still good for the American [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1663.76s)]
*  people. So that's great. But like that is good. But that's not enough. Yeah. And I think that [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1667.12s)]
*  I think that when you don't do that, when you have this very technocratic, third way neoliberal [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1672.8799999999999s)]
*  approach, but you sprinkle in a little bit of like anti corporate, anti billionaire populism that Joe [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1676.8s)]
*  Biden certainly did, it's not your your rudderless ship. You're not communicating effectively like [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1680.6399999999999s)]
*  what you are about. And when you when you don't have a North star that every single person can [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1686.8s)]
*  point to and say, this is what the party is about, your enemies can portray you as whatever they want. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1692.48s)]
*  And that's why the trans anti trans ads are even remotely effective, because you can make the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1697.28s)]
*  Democratic Party look clownish and inconsistent and even silly and hyper focused on whatever key [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1702.48s)]
*  issues there are, because one, they rarely ever focus on universality and programs. Everything has [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1708.5600000000002s)]
*  to be means tested, which I think is is both on the policy front and on the politics front garbage. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1714.48s)]
*  Focus on universal programs, because that way you can cut across every single group and you can [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1720.24s)]
*  disproportionately target marginalized populations, black populations, brown populations and trans [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1726.4s)]
*  people. These like these people do not exist in a vacuum. They're not magical, mystical beings that [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1731.6s)]
*  are not are not experiencing the shocks of the market or they still have to pay rent. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1736.9599999999998s)]
*  They still need workplace protections. They still need, you know, they still need the cost of medicine [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1741.6799999999998s)]
*  to go down. Right. So universal programs capture the attention of all Americans, including this [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1746.6399999999999s)]
*  majority white angry population that is finding themselves in the throes of the Republican [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1751.9199999999998s)]
*  reactionary movement. And so they need to do that. And if they don't do that, then the subtle [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1757.28s)]
*  populism of the right is always going to be the only only game in town. And they're going to be [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1762.8s)]
*  able to present themselves as anti establishment while they have billionaires parading around all [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1766.96s)]
*  of the all the campaign stops like Elon Musk trying to do that X logo every time he jumps like a child. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1772.32s)]
*  I hate Elon Musk. That is the trick, though, man. They're like, it does speak to like a like, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1777.76s)]
*  just how far like, you know, one place where so if you listen to the Harris campaign, the advisors [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1782.64s)]
*  talking to Dan Pfeiffer, I know you did and your problems with it. But one place where they agreed [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1788.64s)]
*  is that like, hey, like, everyone's saying, oh, this trans ed or this trans ed, like it actually [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1792.16s)]
*  might not have been their most effective ad. And they were trying to end what Quentin Falk said was [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1796.0s)]
*  that like they were actually really trying to target it to get at black men. And it looks like [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1800.24s)]
*  maybe that didn't work. Right. That's what that's what we'll see. Like, we're going to get more data. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1804.16s)]
*  But like the point that the ad makes is just that like Democrats are weird. Democrats are strange. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1808.4s)]
*  Yeah. Right. And like they use trans people as a cudgel to do that. But like to the larger point, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1814.0s)]
*  you have billionaires, just the wealthy, literally the wealthiest man in the world. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1818.0800000000002s)]
*  The top seven the top seven donors, this election cycle all donated to the Republican Party, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1822.5600000000002s)]
*  and they were donating like 100 million, 200 million dollars. Like it was crazy. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1827.3600000000001s)]
*  How how did like how do you think about the fact that in right wing media right now, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1830.88s)]
*  and like right wing adjacent media, they are managing to be both the party of the wealthiest [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1835.84s)]
*  oligarchs in the world and the kind of traditional moral set trying to impose a specific way of living [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1842.48s)]
*  on people and anti-establishment kind of rebellious politics. It's Nazi Germany straight up. It's just [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1847.84s)]
*  pure fascism. That's that's all this is. It worked. It worked 100 years ago and it's seemingly working [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1856.56s)]
*  right now. And it's not just the United States of America. It's all across Western Europe. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1862.56s)]
*  The only country that bucked the trend of the incumbency disadvantage seemingly was Mexico. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1866.24s)]
*  One must ask the question why an old dottering man who was still relatively telegenic, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1871.9199999999998s)]
*  even though he believed in wood elves, Duendes, was able to get a tremendous amount of popularity [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1877.6799999999998s)]
*  and then become the transition candidate that actually passed the torch to a younger woman, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1884.96s)]
*  Claudia Scheinbaum. I'm of course talking about Mexico. I'm talking about AMLO is the old man. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1890.88s)]
*  Claudia Scheinbaum was his spiritual and ideological successor in the Morena party. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1894.48s)]
*  Why did that happen? Why was AMLO so popular? And why is Claudia Scheinbaum also incredibly popular? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1899.2s)]
*  Why did Claudia Scheinbaum win the election with even larger marches of victory than AMLO did? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1905.2s)]
*  It's because they expanded the welfare state. They increased minimum wage and and you know they made [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1910.64s)]
*  a whole bunch of decisions that genuinely improve the material conditions of a lot of people in [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1915.28s)]
*  Mexico. And that's something that people will never forget. We talked about the black vote for [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1920.3999999999999s)]
*  a second. As far as voter patterns goes, older black populations, like older black voters as a [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1925.12s)]
*  voting bloc, is a more reliable voting bloc for the Democratic Party than younger black voters are. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1932.16s)]
*  One must ask the question why? That is because people remember the last time the Democratic [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1935.92s)]
*  Party did something for black people. Did something bold, expended social and political capital for [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1940.6399999999999s)]
*  black people. And that is something that people do not forget. If you give people things, they will [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1945.2s)]
*  not forget that. That's why there was a lot of dummies who thought, oh Trump's back. We're going [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1949.52s)]
*  to get some stimmy checks. It's not going to happen, but they still remember that because [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1952.24s)]
*  they think, oh yeah, Trump gave us stimmy checks. I mean- [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1955.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden expanded. I mean, like I know, I know. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1958.64s)]
*  By the way, I'm not pushing back on any of this because I don't like agree with the sentiment. I [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1961.1200000000001s)]
*  just like, I am trying in the weeks after this election to just like, just like question these [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1964.24s)]
*  these sort of statements because then it's like, well, well, Joe Biden expanded the child tax credit, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1968.96s)]
*  made a huge difference for millions of children. No, absolutely. The expansion of the child tax [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1973.68s)]
*  credit was fantastic, but it didn't continue. It was so successful and it didn't continue. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1978.3200000000002s)]
*  Like, do you think American people know why that happened? I don't. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1983.92s)]
*  Who's at fault if American people don't know why that happened? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1987.2s)]
*  It's a, well, that's a, that's a, I think some of it is Democrats. Some of it is the mainstream [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1989.52s)]
*  media. Some of it is the right-wing media. And some of it, by the way, is the left. It is the media [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1994.0800000000002s)]
*  of the left, right? Like I, like the first couple of years, there were, there's been so many moments [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=1998.64s)]
*  where by, by great frustration, I think in the way politics is talked about is, is, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2003.1999999999998s)]
*  is often people do not want to, to do the work of figuring out who's actually responsible, right? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2008.8s)]
*  Like Republicans will shut down the, the, don't worry. I address the, I address the left point [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2014.32s)]
*  as well. Government and mainstream sources will say, Washington gridlock continues, right? Or [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2020.4799999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden will be stymied in some way or Brock Obama. Wait, what? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2027.36s)]
*  Fuck the USA. Fuck the USA. Let's go. You suck. Now you suck. Now shut up. Dank is Canadian. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2030.48s)]
*  Enjoy the fucking tariffs. Okay. We are going to invade Canada, man. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2038.56s)]
*  Obama do this. Why didn't Barack Obama do that when he had a majority, right? Well, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2043.52s)]
*  because it's actually, you know what, in the Senate having 49 votes to get rid of the filibuster and [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2046.96s)]
*  having 50 votes to get rid of the filibuster is a difference between doing a ton of shit and not [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2052.96s)]
*  being able to do anything. That's not the fault of 49 people. That's the result of one person. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2057.92s)]
*  Yeah. Can I bring up something really quick? This conversation that you and I are having, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2061.36s)]
*  have you ever heard a Republican have this conversation? Well, what do you mean? Like, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2064.48s)]
*  like Republicans don't talk this way? Have you ever heard a Republican go, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2067.92s)]
*  sorry, we couldn't get this done because we simply did not have the votes. Is that ever like a real [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2071.04s)]
*  significant front-facing public conversation that the Republicans have? I mean, I feel like you want [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2078.32s)]
*  the answer to be no, but like, do you think the answer is yes? I can't recall the time. Maybe, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2083.92s)]
*  no, I'm asking you. No, I think on their side, like, I think the, I mean, they have over the last [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2087.44s)]
*  decade, slowly but surely gotten rid of the people who are pointing out the actual things that stand [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2093.28s)]
*  in their way, right? They went after Kevin McCarthy. They went out. Well, yeah, like, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2100.32s)]
*  and sometimes that works. Sometimes that leaves them like pretty well stuck. I mean, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2103.92s)]
*  like Donald Trump was president for four years. He wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2107.52s)]
*  didn't have the votes, right? There was a big conversation about why he didn't have the votes. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2111.04s)]
*  That like they're been like Republican, the Republican base, like furious with spending bills, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2114.72s)]
*  spending bills that were passed, right? What did Donald Trump do after when John McCain struck down [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2120.64s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act? Well, what did he do? He took out the individual mandate regardless. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2124.0s)]
*  He did. Well, he did what the same thing a Democratic president would do, do as much as [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2128.56s)]
*  you can legislatively. And when it fails, use your executive power, which is what Biden has done on [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2131.52s)]
*  student loans and a bunch of other issues. Yeah. So my point is he still got the most significant [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2134.24s)]
*  aspect of his agenda across. And in the process, he utilized the bully pulpit, the laser John McCain [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2138.72s)]
*  nonstop and effectively bully John McCain in a way that I've never seen a Democratic president [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2146.8799999999997s)]
*  turn around and communicate about Joe Biden. I'll hear it about the left, about how they're [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2152.16s)]
*  naysayers, how they're spoilers. I never hear it about conservative Democrats. And I think it's [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2156.16s)]
*  the coalition- Well, we can talk about that. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2160.72s)]
*  It's the coalition that you want to have is my point. And I think Democrats win or lose, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2162.3199999999997s)]
*  want to win by their own established policies and the way that they want to win. And they're [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2165.2s)]

*  I just think that is- Or maybe they're just bad and wrong. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2176.96s)]
*  Well, I think people need to be persuaded. I think people need to be- [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2179.2799999999997s)]
*  Biden's student loans is man's deluge. I mean, he did. He did abolish a bunch of student loans [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2182.16s)]
*  with the executive power. He did do that. He should have gone further, but he did do that. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2186.08s)]
*  Persuaded. David Plouffe talking to Pfeiffer yesterday. He's like, look, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2190.8799999999997s)]
*  you go to a swing state, you got a certain percentage of liberals, progressives, you got [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2194.08s)]
*  a certain percentage of conservatives, and you got this vast swath of moderates. You need them. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2197.44s)]
*  You need them. Now, I think where you're right is there is something about a Democratic [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2200.16s)]
*  establishment, establishment figures that feel more comfortable with a Liz Cheney- [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2205.04s)]
*  We're going to get to the genocide stuff in a second. Don't worry. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2210.08s)]
*  ... at the table. A big chunk of this conversation [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2212.3199999999997s)]
*  devolves into talking about Israel. With a leftist sitting at the table. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2216.3199999999997s)]
*  It's gross. And that the disagreements with Liz Cheney [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2218.88s)]
*  are more acceptable and the disagreements to the left are less acceptable. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2221.12s)]
*  But one must ask the question, why is that acceptable? Liz Cheney is anti-LGBT. Liz [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2227.2s)]
*  Cheney is anti-abortion. Liz Cheney is anti-democratic party. Liz Cheney is the daughter of a [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2230.24s)]
*  rabid, warmongering, terrorist sociopath, Dick Cheney. And yet there are Democrats who are more [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2234.96s)]
*  comfortable with her than people who also would totally be on board with the Democratic party, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2239.92s)]
*  but I don't know, have maybe sometimes identical opinions of Liz Cheney on even LGBT issues. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2245.44s)]
*  Joe Rogan is a great example of this. The Democratic party has consistently [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2251.76s)]
*  utilized and weaponized in the most cynical ways possible identity politics. And I say this as [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2255.6s)]
*  someone who is infinitely more progressive than the average Democrat on these issues. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2260.2400000000002s)]
*  They just use it. They use it against Bernie. They use it against every single person. And now [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2263.68s)]
*  they're dropping it themselves. That makes every Democrat look like a silly fool. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2268.48s)]
*  It does. In the eyes of Americans, they go, you called us racist. You called us transphobic. You [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2275.04s)]
*  called us crazy. And now you're saying, okay, my bad. Of course people are going to go, all right, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2279.12s)]
*  I guess I'm primed into now believing the Republicans. You're pushing your base [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2284.08s)]
*  towards being more open-minded to right-wing policies. That's the only thing you're doing. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2287.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's the only thing you're doing when you don't actually claw back a lot of the [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2292.16s)]
*  things that the Republicans, the former Republican administration engages in. Democrats are very good [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2297.2799999999997s)]
*  at trying to fix the deficit. They're the only real deficit hawks. Republicans certainly don't [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2300.96s)]
*  care. They only use it as a weapon to wield, to communicate against the Democratic agenda. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2305.12s)]
*  But outside of that, on foreign policy, Joe Biden said he was going to be an effective foreign [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2311.28s)]
*  policy leader. He did NATO. He kept talking about NATO jack, AUKUS, as though that was going to be- [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2315.36s)]
*  He loved talking about AUKUS. I have never been more- [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2319.68s)]
*  Oh dude, there's a Ryan Routh mansion coming. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2321.84s)]
*  I've never been more nervous in politics, other than the day before an election, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2324.64s)]
*  than when Joe Biden was still in the race and he did that press conference. And he was like, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2328.88s)]
*  talk about AUKUS. No one knows what the fuck AUKUS is. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2332.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. That's a deep cut. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2334.48s)]
*  That is a deep cut. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2335.52s)]
*  But Joe Biden was like, I'm the adult in the room, Jack. I'm going to bring back America into the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2336.2400000000002s)]
*  global stage. The way that the American public sees that is there's war in Ukraine. And that's [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2342.1600000000003s)]
*  not even Joe Biden's fault. I understand that. That's Vladimir Putin decided, I'm going to do [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2346.7200000000003s)]
*  the insane thing. I'm going to invade Ukraine. That's psychotic. But the way that people see it, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2350.6400000000003s)]
*  they're like, why are we giving money to Ukraine when we're not fixing the potholes? Why are we [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2355.44s)]
*  giving money to Ukraine when the ISP suck here? What the hell's going on? Why are we giving money [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2358.72s)]
*  to Ukraine where we don't have healthcare? We have homeless people everywhere. And then on top of [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2361.52s)]
*  that, they see that instability as something that is Joe Biden's fault. Fair or unfair, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2365.04s)]
*  it doesn't matter. They attribute it to Joe Biden. Same thing with Israel-Palestine. They look to what [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2369.2s)]
*  is going on and they're like, this is insane. Biden will come out and say, or used to come out and [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2374.64s)]
*  say, we're going to do a two-state solution. Benjamin Netanyahu the next day would be like, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2379.8399999999997s)]
*  fuck the two-state. What do you mean? How about no state? Literally, the next day. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2383.2s)]
*  And Biden kept trying to do this thing where he was like finger wagging, where he's like, oh, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2387.52s)]
*  I'm really, I'm going to give him a heart to heart, real man to man. For a lot of Americans, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2391.12s)]
*  they saw that as like, you're weak. You're old, you're weak, you're feeble, and you're getting [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2395.6800000000003s)]
*  dog-walked by an American ally in a very public and very embarrassing way. And there's a metric [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2399.28s)]
*  ton of violence that's happening on top of that. He ironically destroyed the goodwill that a lot [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2404.88s)]
*  of people had coming in to his administration with the last, I guess, post-Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2410.24s)]
*  Everything was bad after that with respect to Joe Biden's foreign policy. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2418.72s)]
*  It's also tied to- I still defend the Afghan withdrawal, by the way. And I think the Democrats [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2421.68s)]
*  also dropped the ball on that too, because they should have stood 10 toes down and said, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2426.8799999999997s)]
*  that was the right thing to do. We exhibited political courage. And for the record, Republicans [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2430.8799999999997s)]
*  tried to do a 13, the 13 of our best soldiers died in Afghanistan thing over and over again, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2435.2799999999997s)]
*  the cynical thing that they tried to do. Republicans are shameless. Democrats are less [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2439.04s)]
*  out. They should be shameless. I'm just, I'm just, I'm describing what the issues. Yeah. I mean, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2442.56s)]
*  part of this though too, like I- Oh, they cut, they cut a bunch of stuff here. I said, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2446.24s)]
*  Democrats should have said 67 soldiers died in Afghanistan under the Trump reign versus the 13 [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2451.04s)]
*  that died under, you know, like there's a reason why no soldier should die, but there's a reason why, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2457.6s)]
*  you know, this is a significantly limited, the casualties because we pulled out, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2466.16s)]
*  you were on water show. Yeah, I saw. We'll look at that later. Like huge, huge policy problem [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2472.3199999999997s)]
*  and how the body administration has responded. They cut it because it's an hour and 50, the [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2480.7999999999997s)]
*  conversation took two hours, Chad. It was supposed to be 30 minutes. I think that's the reason why [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2484.96s)]
*  they cut a bunch of stuff. They cut my Ryan Ruth joke too, to the war in Gaza. But on that issue, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2489.8399999999997s)]
*  a bunch of foreign policy issues, a bunch of domestic issues, some of the problem has been [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2496.24s)]
*  Joe Biden gave state of the union, which was good. And everyone's like, okay, I'm just, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2499.92s)]
*  that's what happened. Okay. But other than that, he has been such an ineffective communicator that, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2504.96s)]
*  and it has gotten so much worse over the- I'm glad that, I'm glad that they cut out some of [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2510.08s)]
*  my jokes. I definitely made a bunch of, I made a bunch of jokes that, that what? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2513.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, of course. The last year. Yeah, cause he's old as fuck. I know, I know. But like, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2526.08s)]
*  we're in this moment where we're like, kind of trying to like, what went wrong? What about this? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2537.52s)]
*  What about that? People are so mad. Like the people are like, like they're like the answers [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2540.64s)]
*  that, that commonwealth advisors gave were unsatisfying. Yeah, they are unsatisfying, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2545.92s)]
*  but so much of this, I just like, there was a giant anti-incumbent fervor around the world. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2548.88s)]
*  Joe Biden was completely unable to articulate a defense of his policies. Right? Like the fact [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2555.04s)]
*  that there is inflation and people are mad about inflation is not a reason alone. Like that does, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2560.6400000000003s)]
*  like that explains, that can explain why we lost if you accept that we had no agency [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2564.56s)]
*  in competing against that argument. But like Joe Biden certainly had no, like just could not [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2569.36s)]
*  communicate effectively. I think you'll see what happens when someone effectively bullies corporations, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2573.84s)]
*  regardless of being a right-wing Republican in the upcoming Trump administration. Things are going to [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2579.52s)]
*  get significantly worse for every single person, including the people that voted for Donald Trump. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2583.76s)]
*  One of the funniest aspects of the tariffs conversation that's happening right now is that [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2587.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to implement wide, you know, broad tariffs on 45% of all trade that comes in [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2590.96s)]
*  and out of the United States of America, Mexico, Canada, and China comprise 45% of all trade. He [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2596.48s)]
*  wants a tariff every single one. Tariffs are obviously an entry fee that like the, the, the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2601.28s)]
*  American corporations are going to be paying. None of the, none of the countries are going to be [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2605.28s)]
*  paying for these tariffs. It's a, it's a policy that's going to destroy drop shippers, which [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2608.1600000000003s)]
*  overwhelmingly vote for Donald Trump and the Trump merchandise industry. So that's pretty funny, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2612.32s)]
*  but having said that it's going to be devastating for the economy. Now, what do I think Trump will [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2616.96s)]
*  do in the process? He'll obviously use tariffs to, to basically get corporations and industries and [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2620.56s)]
*  sector leaders on board with his agenda. So when he says jump, they say how high or I'm going to [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2625.6800000000003s)]
*  slap you with tariffs and it's going to actually punish you. It's going to hurt your bottom line. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2630.4s)]
*  And I think that's part of the reason why they're going to do that. The other reason is a [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2633.92s)]
*  regressive tax is a broad sales tax on all consumers that, you know, disproportionately [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2636.56s)]
*  affects the working poor and we're hoping he's loved that shit. But he also at times, I think [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2640.88s)]
*  we'll just, you know, Institute the defense production act or something. Like we'll see it. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2646.56s)]
*  We kind of saw it in COVID as well when it was a necessity, but, but that's the thing. Like [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2649.84s)]
*  the American government is powerful. All governments are powerful, but the American [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2654.56s)]
*  government is especially powerful. It's the wealthiest nation on the planet. And the way [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2657.6800000000003s)]
*  that it runs is basically it's like 50 companies in a trench coat. We are working at the behest of [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2662.08s)]
*  corporations. We feed them with our tax dollars that turn into subsidies for them. They utilize [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2665.76s)]
*  those subsidies to, I guess, lower production costs, but then they use that to increase their [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2670.72s)]
*  profit margins and, and engage in what used to be illegal pre Ronald Reagan, you know, stock buybacks [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2674.56s)]
*  and the light market manipulation of all different sorts. And we're constantly deregulating the [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2679.68s)]
*  economy. And, and I think that it's not just about having like a, a, a populist message is about [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2683.6s)]
*  actually implementing said populist message and, and show who your real enemies are. Like not be [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2689.6s)]
*  afraid to say these people are fucking your life up. And if you are truly the pro working [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2694.56s)]
*  class party as the Democrats want to be, as they claim they were historically, right. And there [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2701.04s)]
*  were certainly times when they were, then you have to say these corporations and the wealthy [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2705.68s)]
*  that have given us money as well as the Republican party and always have been hedging their bets [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2712.24s)]
*  are the real reason why you're feeling this economic anxiety, the real reason why you feel [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2715.92s)]
*  hopeless, that you will never be able to own a home, that you'll never be able to retire. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2719.7599999999998s)]
*  And the Republicans are always in defense of them. They will distract you with lies. They will say [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2723.92s)]
*  your fellow neighbors, you know, your God fearing Christian Muslim, whatever Jewish neighbors are [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2728.8s)]
*  your enemy. When in fact, we know what the problem is. So we're going to bring them to heal. This [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2733.76s)]
*  kind of messaging is terrifying obviously for many different reasons. And it will never happen within [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2738.88s)]
*  the democratic party. But in the absence of that, I don't think that's true. We'll see in the app. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2743.44s)]
*  No, I think you'll just get focus grouped messaging and means testing about the opportunity [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2747.84s)]
*  economy, which Kamala Harris presented at a time when people were, you know, when wage growth had [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2751.84s)]
*  never actually caught up to the cost of living and cost of housing. Yeah. Which by the way is like, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2756.7200000000003s)]
*  you need to be, but this is, but like, Oh, you need to deflate housing. That's a, that, that I build, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2762.08s)]
*  you need to build vast amounts of housing. Yeah. The, the federal jobs program, get these fucking [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2765.84s)]
*  incels to work. But we got to get these incels to work. No, get them to work. Give them, give them, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2770.4s)]
*  how did they like it or not? They're going to get good, well paying jobs with good benefits. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2774.6400000000003s)]
*  They're going to get socialized medicine, and they're going to work. None of this [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2778.2400000000002s)]
*  neat stuff anymore. They can't, they can't be online all the time. They're, they're too online. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2781.76s)]
*  It's your business. Now you're going to, now you're going after your own business. I'm happy for, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2785.0400000000004s)]
*  like it, I would, I would drop everything if we got universal healthcare and a federal jobs program [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2787.92s)]
*  and, and we're building public housing all around the country. That's fine. There's a place where the [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2792.32s)]
*  left, the online left and the online right meets and it kind of meets a little bit. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2797.28s)]
*  People who think RFK has some good ideas a little bit, a little bit. What do you think? What do you [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2800.88s)]
*  like, what, what is the appeal there? Cranks. Just cranks? Yeah. Anti-establishment cranks. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2804.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of them. There's the, the Tulsi Gabbard constituency, which is like marginal. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2809.2s)]
*  It's not all that significant. But, but yeah, I think that the, the online left is not as robust [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2813.6s)]
*  a media ecosystem as like people think it is in general. And besides that, they don't have any [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2819.6s)]
*  sort of like political motion regardless. Right. I am, you know, I have disagreements with the, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2823.92s)]
*  the closest Congress members that are ideologically as close, a lot closely aligned with myself as [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2830.0s)]
*  possible, but I still have many disagreements with them. And, and outside of that, I think [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2835.12s)]
*  like these guys that, you know, like RFK junior, cause they think he's going to make America healthy [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2840.24s)]
*  again. You know, they're just, they just like the crank stuff. That's what it is. I mean, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2844.16s)]
*  you know, Oh, another part that was cut, I think was when I was actually talking about the left [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2848.7999999999997s)]
*  media ecosystem and how like I brought, I dropped names. I should have taught travel, trap house, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2852.88s)]
*  or report, you know, drop site news, all these places. Like we have been very aggressive [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2859.8399999999997s)]
*  defenders of things that Biden has done when it's actually in the interest of, of, you know, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2867.2799999999997s)]
*  serving the American working class. Like you talked to, like when I'm really like four years, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2874.88s)]
*  I guess eight years ago, Jesus, after Trump won the first time, what I was feeling at the time, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2880.24s)]
*  which I'm still feeling now is that like the two challenges, right? Is that like at a moment where [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2884.08s)]
*  someone like Trump is ascendant, like, how do you keep this big, this big left together, this big [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2889.6s)]
*  tent together from yes, it includes the kind of pro democracy anti-Trump right runs all the way to [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2895.7599999999998s)]
*  the far left and like, and, and leftists. How do you keep that big group of people together? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2902.88s)]
*  And I do think like you're right. Like there is just in part because there's just so much money [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2907.7599999999998s)]
*  behind it. Like the online right is, I think it's, it's bigger and more influential, but it also [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2910.72s)]
*  knows how to get on board, right? Like it knows, like it fights, it has disagreements, it pushes, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2917.4399999999996s)]
*  but then it knows like for our ends, for our goals, we all need to get behind, whether it's Trump or [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2921.12s)]
*  in previous elections, it was getting behind like Romney, like figures, McCain, like they get behind [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2926.72s)]
*  those figures. And sometimes it feels like on the, on the left, like the, like the, there's no moment [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2930.3999999999996s)]
*  at which we say, all right, we've had the fight, we've had the, we've had, we've had the debate, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2936.0s)]
*  we disagree on a whole bunch of stuff. Hey everybody, we're going to get together. We're [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2939.92s)]
*  going to make sure that we stop Donald Trump. We elect Joe Biden as much as we let Kamala Harris. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2942.7200000000003s)]
*  Like that moment doesn't come. And like, I'm not saying that Democrats in power aren't in part [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2946.32s)]
*  responsible for that. I think part of what we need to do is figure out a politics that brings people [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2951.44s)]
*  in, but it is, it does require, it does like, everyone is responsible. Yeah. I think, just as [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2955.92s)]
*  I was very critical of Bernie Sanders' campaign, despite, you know, still loving Bernie, because he [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2962.8s)]
*  was nowhere near as aggressive as he could have been in the primaries. And, and, and it, you know, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2967.52s)]
*  definitely should have probably gone on more like independent media route in a similar vein to Donald [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2974.0s)]
*  Trump. I am still, because I blame the fault on Bernie's campaign strategies in the primaries, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2979.12s)]
*  despite recognizing the, the structural hurdles of like a left-wing populist coming out of a [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2986.0s)]
*  Democratic party primary, where it's like the laser focused audience that goes out and votes [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2992.8s)]
*  at those things, or like the MSNBC watcher base that is like objectively terrified of someone like [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=2996.72s)]
*  that, because people are saying he's going to, you know, start executing wealthy people. It's [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3000.0s)]
*  still, it's still his fault. And it's still the campaign's fault in this regard as well. And that's [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3002.8799999999997s)]
*  why I brought forward the point that like, you can have a billion point five, right? You can have [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3006.4s)]
*  ground game. None of that matters if the message is not actually addressing the real issues that [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3010.64s)]
*  Americans are facing. And the reason why I think the Republicans can, you know, go out and vote for [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3015.7599999999998s)]
*  the Republican party and, and don't usually sit it out, I guess, and instead are able to say, suck [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3020.64s)]
*  it up and say, yeah, we're still going to vote for Donald Trump is because there are single issue [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3026.16s)]
*  voters out there and Trump, they know that Trump is going to protect it. People that like guns are [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3031.04s)]
*  going to be like, I like my guns, I'm going to be able to marry my gun. I want to be able to have [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3034.64s)]
*  sex with my gun. I know Donald Trump is going to be the guy that lets that happen. And I know the [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3037.6s)]
*  Democrats are going to shun me for wanting to have sex with my gun. So that guy is going to go and [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3041.04s)]
*  vote for Trump regardless, right? On the other side though, if your top line communication, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3045.44s)]
*  your major policy prescriptions are like, we have to preserve these institutions, we have to [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3049.8399999999997s)]
*  preserve civility and we have to preserve democracy at a time when Americans are like, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3053.52s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about democracy, just lower the price of eggs. Then you're not, there's no [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3056.4s)]
*  way that I could outflank the Democratic party and get people to, to vote for Kamala Harris that, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3061.28s)]
*  you know, in a way that, that sticks in a way that is going to be successful. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3068.24s)]
*  No matter how much influence I wield. It's not, yeah, I'm not even just talking about, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3072.24s)]
*  yes, take your point. Most people are just not voting. That's the problem. But, but the, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3076.32s)]
*  challenge right is that like, there are like these three, let's say you say there's these three kind [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3080.56s)]
*  of media ecosystems. There's the right wing one, there's a kind of mainstream one, and there's the [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3084.08s)]
*  left wing, there's the left one. The one on the right is built to attack Democrats. The one in [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3087.52s)]
*  the middle is built to attack Washington and politics. And the one on the left is built to [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3092.16s)]
*  attack Democrats. It is. I mean, like, I don't, I think they're trying to pressure Democrats to be [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3095.36s)]
*  a more moral and just version of itself. I think I probably spend more time shitting on the Republican [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3098.96s)]
*  party than the Democratic party, but yeah. But I'm saying when we're talking about like, when the [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3103.6s)]
*  right is talking, when, when right wing media, it is trying to be a team player and it is attacking [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3106.72s)]
*  Democrats and supporting Republicans. The middle is attacking both and the left is attacking [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3110.72s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans. There is no place, right? There is no like big kind of fun, exciting [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3114.3999999999996s)]
*  media environment outside of, I guess, fucking this table where like you have a lot of people [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3119.8399999999997s)]
*  that are like critical to the Democratic party, like annoyed by the same things we're talking [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3124.7999999999997s)]
*  about, but ultimately it's just like, we got to win and we have to get behind these people. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3127.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Well, but again, it is because for many people on the right wing ecosystem, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3130.56s)]
*  like they have their toys, they have their treats and the Republicans are giving them those toys [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3136.08s)]
*  in those streets. Whereas the Democrats are offering what? No, I agree. That's where I'm like, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3140.24s)]
*  what are they offering? Well, yeah, no, I know we got to fucking figure out. It doesn't matter to me. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3144.96s)]
*  I'm rich. Okay. Like, I mean, I probably might go to prison with project Esther. It gets kicked in [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3147.84s)]
*  or if they denaturalize me or something, but Hey, come on. You know, I mean, who knows? We'll see. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3152.7999999999997s)]
*  But you can, but I mean, you can be rich abroad. That is true. My point is, but I like, I like [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3157.2799999999997s)]
*  being here. I like, I like trying to solve some of the problems in America at least. But overall, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3163.68s)]
*  the point is not that I'm rich. The point is that the point I'm making is that like, I care about [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3169.12s)]
*  my fellow Americans. I care about them, their lives getting better. They're improving their [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3176.24s)]
*  material conditions. And I recognize that if Democrats keep losing, then Republicans are [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3180.8799999999997s)]
*  going to keep ruining this country further. And I want the Democrats to win. I want to be the most [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3187.2s)]
*  regime-pilled propaganda minister you've ever seen. But I can't do that if the Democratic party [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3190.64s)]
*  is not offering anything. I guess what I, here's what I, and I think that's all fair. I guess like [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3196.0s)]
*  where I'm like, what I'm trying to see is like, what is the path to the Democrats creating the kind [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3200.08s)]
*  of story that's backed by candidates, that's backed by message, that's backed by policy, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3204.96s)]
*  that's backed by having the right enemies, telling that kind of story. Right. And then in concert [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3209.92s)]
*  with that, like it is a kind of like to go, we do need to kind of like virtuous circle where then [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3214.0s)]
*  more and more people in left media start to accept that the vehicle for changing this country for [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3218.64s)]
*  the better is the Democratic party. If we were consistently, I mean, I can't speak for everybody [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3225.2799999999997s)]
*  else on the left. I don't know who you're talking about when you say this, but like I can speak to [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3229.2799999999997s)]
*  my friends that are over at Dropsite News, former intercept guys like Jeremy Scahill and Ryan Grimm. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3231.44s)]
*  I can speak to a majority report that was way more in the tank for Kamala than I was for sure. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3237.12s)]
*  Like they were very openly more excited at the prospect of Kamala Harris. I was definitely a [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3241.04s)]
*  lot more depressed by no matter who wins, we are still cooked was my attitude, but like certainly [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3245.84s)]
*  understanding and recognizing that John Trump is going to be far worse than Kamala Harris, of course, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3250.56s)]
*  and Chappell Trap House. Right. So these are some of the largest media companies out there on the [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3255.52s)]
*  left, right. Outside of the orbit of the Democratic party, every single one of these outlets, myself [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3261.1200000000003s)]
*  included, talked more about the Biden administration's accomplishments with the NLRB, with Lena [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3266.8s)]
*  Kahn at the FTC with like, you know, trust busting and numerous other accomplishments [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3271.2s)]
*  that the Democratic party actually brought forward. Then they did. And it didn't matter. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3275.9199999999996s)]
*  My point is, we always defended, we always, always defended the Afghan withdrawal unconditionally. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3280.3999999999996s)]
*  You never saw that on even, you barely saw that on MSNBC. We always defended that. We always [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3286.16s)]
*  defended Lena Kahn. We always defended the NLRB. We always defended the walking, the symbolic move [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3290.3999999999996s)]
*  that Joe Biden made when he went to the UAW picket line. We didn't forget that. We talked about that. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3295.52s)]
*  It didn't matter. It's not enough, especially when there is a, there's so much that Joe Biden did, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3300.16s)]
*  I think, outside of the, the, the economic pressures that Americans were experiencing. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3307.12s)]
*  That was certainly going to play a pivotal role in the election. But there's so much that he did [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3313.04s)]
*  in the month of October in 2023 that just, you're right. It was a mistake that I didn't bring up the [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3316.8799999999997s)]
*  talk to a pod and all the stuff that Haley Welch has done at the behest of the Democratic party. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3320.96s)]
*  Doors open. Okay. Well, I missed it. Just completely wiped that. That made it impossible [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3327.04s)]
*  to defend him because it became the major focus of a lot of people. And there's not, like, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3333.7599999999998s)]
*  there's nothing you can do in that moment when people are, you know, seeing exactly what's going [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3341.2799999999997s)]
*  on and getting frustrated. He unveiled the right-wing immigration bill on October 5th, 2023. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3344.64s)]
*  If I'm, I might be getting the date wrong, but it was like literally two days before October 7th. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3350.4s)]
*  He did that. And then October 7 happened and he went and he bear hugged Netanyahu [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3353.84s)]
*  and kept giving, you know, unlimited weapons to Israel over and over again, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3357.6800000000003s)]
*  never restraining Israel. Everybody knew exactly what was going to happen. It had happened before [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3361.92s)]
*  and it was going to be much worse. And yet no restraint whatsoever. And it has, I think, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3366.0s)]
*  diminished America's soft power capabilities on the global stage further. It has eroded America's [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3371.6000000000004s)]
*  influence and soft power capabilities in the Western world. Obviously the global South already [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3376.96s)]
*  knew what was up. They've always known, but they have no power. They have no voice. It doesn't [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3381.12s)]
*  matter. But the populations in Western Europe recognizing what was going on and actually starting [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3384.4s)]
*  to protest against it, I mean, that's different. I'm saying this as someone who's been an advocate [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3389.8399999999997s)]
*  for Palestinian emancipation for the past 10 years publicly. I've never seen this groundswell of [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3394.3199999999997s)]
*  this massive sea change, this attitude shift in such a dramatic fashion over the course of the [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3399.68s)]
*  last 12 months. And they did not address that at all. And instead they hugged and kissed neocons [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3403.92s)]
*  and talked about, even in the VP debate, like Israel having the nuclear first strike capability. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3408.24s)]
*  What an insane conversation we're having after 12 months of genocide. Americans [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3413.2s)]
*  fancy themselves to be peaceful people. It's a lie. America's foreign interventions are anything [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3418.24s)]
*  but peaceful. But even then the media ecosystem usually just shelters Americans from the genuine [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3424.7999999999997s)]
*  devastating impact of America's actions globally. But for that reason, Americans can at least feel [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3431.2s)]
*  like they're peaceful does, which is why Donald Trump, despite never being a peaceful dove, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3435.6s)]
*  was able to effectively communicate that he was actually anti-Iraq war against Hillary Clinton [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3439.68s)]
*  in 2016, which was a resilient message that actually showcased them as more moderate than [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3443.7599999999998s)]
*  Hillary Clinton in the eyes of many Americans. He did four years of no peaceful dove shit [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3447.92s)]
*  whatsoever. And then he turned around and after October 7 was still able to effectively outflank [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3452.88s)]
*  the Democrats on this issue, despite the fact that he got a hundred million dollars from [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3458.3199999999997s)]
*  Miriam Adelson, Sheldon Adelson's wife, to eventually annex the West Bank and put [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3461.7599999999998s)]
*  rabid evangelical freaks like Mike Huckabee as the Israeli ambassador. These guys are insane. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3467.7599999999998s)]
*  That's why it is very heartbreaking for me too. I think one of the reasons people will be mad [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3475.6s)]
*  that you're on the show is because you're a proud anti-Sinist. Like you said that. I've gotten shit [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3481.68s)]
*  for saying. I was about to say anti-Semite. I was like, damn. Joining us today, anti-Semite dumbass. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3485.44s)]
*  No, but that, but like I actually, like a couple, like two or three years ago, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3489.6s)]
*  I said on Pond of America, like that I described myself as a Zionist, which got people upset too. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3494.56s)]
*  But what I, what I said then and what I still say now is, and I actually had the same conversation [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3500.3199999999997s)]
*  with Bernie is like, you, like you ought to denounce the destruction and death in Gaza. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3504.16s)]
*  You ought to denounce the moral abomination that is taking over the West Bank on its own terms, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3511.2799999999997s)]
*  because it is morally reprehensible. It is despicable. It is, it is, these are war crimes [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3518.0s)]
*  being committed against innocent Palestinians who are paying with their lives for the crimes of [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3524.72s)]
*  Hamas. And like, you don't need to go further than that. What I'm saying is it is also terrible for [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3532.32s)]
*  Israel and you don't need to care about that. No, I agree. No, I know. And that, and like I, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3537.36s)]
*  what Bernie said, like I always appreciate what he has to say on this issue. And he said, is that [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3542.16s)]
*  basically even Israel does not understand the way in which they're becoming an isolated pariah [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3545.76s)]
*  nation. And so I like, like people will be mad to have someone who is a self-proclaimed anti-Zionist [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3549.6000000000004s)]
*  on this show, but like I am someone who has called himself a Zionist and I am against this because I [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3555.76s)]
*  believe it doesn't serve Israel's interest either. And that to me is what is so devastating about the [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3559.84s)]
*  outcome of this election in part because of policy, in part because Joe Biden is such an [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3563.92s)]
*  incomprehensible messenger. I'm one of the most delicate and contentious topics in American [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3568.0800000000004s)]
*  politics. We now have Donald Trump who was able to kind of allied what his actual views would be [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3573.6s)]
*  on this issue. And like, you know, we have, we have seen what happens in Israel when you have someone [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3579.44s)]
*  like Trump in power at a moment of crisis. And now there is Trump back in office here. And if you are [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3584.16s)]
*  concerned about the lives of Palestinians, if you're concerned about continuing instability and [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3588.56s)]
*  violence and death in that region, this election has just made everything so much fucking worse. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3592.4s)]
*  American foreign policy being so uniparty on this issue is genuinely frustrating and it's [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3597.7599999999998s)]
*  genuinely damaging for Israel because we recognize how our fellow Americans are becoming more [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3602.72s)]
*  reactionary every single day, especially with this new Trump election. You see people that [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3607.4399999999996s)]
*  formerly maybe had different opinions go, you know what, maybe it is good to deport 20 million people [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3611.2s)]
*  violently by utilizing the military potentially. This is something that the Donald Trump administration [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3616.3999999999996s)]
*  has said they're going to do. Well, at the very least, even if people don't believe that'll happen [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3620.56s)]
*  or didn't understand, like these things are not there. These things are not like the expectation [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3622.9599999999996s)]
*  that Donald Trump taking all these extreme positions would be enough. Yeah. Wasn't that just [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3627.04s)]
*  wasn't true? What I'm trying to explain here is that before you know it, people can succumb to [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3630.24s)]
*  reactionary feelings and reactionary sentiment and find themselves in the throes of fascist ideology [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3636.64s)]
*  without even recognizing it. And I think examining that is important in an academic setting. That's [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3641.4399999999996s)]
*  why we have Holocaust studies, right? That's why we have genocide studies as an entire field [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3645.6s)]
*  to specifically understand exactly how Nazi Germany got to that position or fascist Italy [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3649.3599999999997s)]
*  got to the position that it got to. And I think that you might even disagree with me on this, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3653.9199999999996s)]
*  but like that's where Israel is. That's where Israel is at right now. They have become an [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3659.12s)]
*  incredibly angry culture, an incredibly angry country that has succumbed, especially since [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3664.3199999999997s)]
*  the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, who wasn't exactly a great guy for Palestinians either. I [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3672.24s)]
*  mean, he was known as the guy who deliberately tasked Israeli security forces in breaking the [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3676.16s)]
*  hands of children for stone throwing, right? In the first Intifada. That guy was the like off-ramp [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3680.24s)]
*  for peace negotiations with Palestinians. And they assassinated him and his assassins and people who [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3687.9199999999996s)]
*  are backing his assassins like Itamar Ben-Ghivir, like Bezalel Smotrich are now firmly a part of the [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3693.04s)]
*  Israeli establishment. The current government. It's kind of crazy that people have the audacity. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3699.6s)]
*  People who like read Wikipedia pages have the audacity to claim that I don't know what the [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3705.2799999999997s)]
*  fuck I'm talking about when it comes to foreign policy and that I'm out of my element. Like it [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3708.8799999999997s)]
*  is kind of wild that they just rely exclusively on mainstream narratives and the, in the fact [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3713.76s)]
*  that people just genuinely don't know anything about this kind of shit that to just basically say [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3718.48s)]
*  such slanderous statements, you know? Yeah. Well, yeah, maybe that's why I'm giving talks in the UK. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3726.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Also, there are also hundreds of thousands of Israelis who have protested this government. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3733.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. For different reasons, but yeah, no, for sure. Yes. And I get like, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3738.7200000000003s)]
*  I just think it's important. Yes. Like Israel is responsible for Israel's actions, but we do need [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3743.6800000000003s)]
*  to separate Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct from the Israeli people in the same, that doesn't [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3749.76s)]
*  mean they're not responsible in the same way that America is not George W. Bush, right? But America [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3754.96s)]
*  is responsible for what George W. Bush, when he is in command of our armed forces. Yeah. But we [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3759.28s)]
*  understand that distinction. No, no, of course. The problem is you have to also look at the Overton [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3763.28s)]
*  Window though, in any society, in any culture, in any country, right? And I think that, and I come [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3768.24s)]
*  from, I'm Turkish, like I come from a country with a conscription. Like I understand what ultra [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3773.8399999999997s)]
*  nationalism is. I've lived through it. I've experienced it. I know what it's like when [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3779.6s)]
*  Turkish people hear me say like that the Armenian genocide is real, for example, like that's like a [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3783.7599999999998s)]
*  non-starter, right? That's like, you can't say that. What are you talking about? I learned in school [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3787.2s)]
*  that it wasn't real, right? Like I understand how a country can become more and more right-wing, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3790.16s)]
*  where even the liberal position is still committed to the maintenance of an apartheid. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3797.04s)]
*  And I think that that is where we're at with Israel. And we have to restrain Israel as we are [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3803.04s)]
*  the number one partner of Israel, whether it be the weapons that we give to Israel, whether it be [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3809.2799999999997s)]
*  the financials, whether we give to Israel, or whether it be the trade partnership that we have, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3814.8s)]
*  or the financial partnership that we have with Israeli companies. We have a lot of influence [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3818.96s)]
*  over what Israel does. And I think over the course of the last couple decades, especially with Benjamin [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3824.56s)]
*  Netanyahu, Israel has become a more and more right-wing nation. Yes, it is a country that [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3828.7999999999997s)]
*  now views itself as being isolated and under siege, right? Like all of this is. This is really funny [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3834.08s)]
*  when people say it's totally on site for commies like it's not. What are you going to do, man? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3839.68s)]
*  You're going to come to my house and suck my cock? Is that what you want? You saw the meat pick? Are [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3843.2s)]
*  you doing meat watch? You saw the meat on main and you're like, damn, I want it in my mouth. Is [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3847.92s)]
*  that what it is? Big boy. I am bandy. You can, you can speak. You can speak on it if you want. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3852.72s)]
*  Is that, is that your goal? A little bit of meat watch for you? Huh? Is that what you're going to [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3858.56s)]
*  do? Are you going to come over? You're going to suck my dick dry? Huh? Is that what you're going to do? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3864.0s)]
*  It's on site for commies like you. Okay, dude. Okay. Psycho solitaire type of motherfucker that [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3869.68s)]
*  literally perishes at the mere prospect of having a social interaction with a fucking cashier. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3877.52s)]
*  Dumbass. Like we have moved in the wrong direction in a bunch of like, this is all [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3883.44s)]
*  gotten to be so kind of hopeless. Israel faces recombination from around the world, feels isolated, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3889.92s)]
*  feels like it needs to turn inward to protect itself, views itself as being under attack. Well, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3894.32s)]
*  it's like the question right to me is like, how do you break that cycle? I agree. It requires a ton [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3899.44s)]
*  of American pressure, but it also, I think like the turn like anti-Zionist fervor, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3903.6s)]
*  to me like anti-Zionism itself is not a path to where we ultimately need to go, which is a [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3909.7599999999998s)]
*  peace, peace and Palestinian self-determination, right? Like that's like, that's what I believe [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3915.04s)]
*  in. Like that's what I care about. That's where I want this. Like, like Israel, Israel as a country [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3918.96s)]
*  that no longer feels constantly under threat, Palestinians being able to live in peace and [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3923.12s)]
*  safety without being under occupation in control of their own destiny. And to me like that, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3928.56s)]
*  it's become a kind of like, that is a two state solution and anything that drives towards that, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3933.7599999999998s)]
*  I think is ultimately the direction we need to go. Right now we're moving in the opposite direction, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3937.2799999999997s)]
*  which is why this all feels so hopeless. I mean, look, I used to be of that same mindset, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3940.4s)]
*  maybe like a decade ago as well, where I, I resort to the likes of Avi Shalim on this or [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3945.6s)]
*  Ilan Pappé on this in terms of like my analysis of it, but like the settlement operations in the [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3951.52s)]
*  so-called peace process that were again funded by America as well. And still funded to this day by [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3955.68s)]
*  like the likes of Kofi, Christians United for Israel, which is the oftentimes not talked about [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3960.8799999999997s)]
*  part of this equation that is significant and dare I say more significant than, than whatever [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3966.8799999999997s)]
*  Jewish Americans think about Israel. Like it's the right-wing evangelical Christians that are [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3972.08s)]
*  the number one funders of the settlement project. But it's also like the consequences for the [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3977.2799999999997s)]
*  expansion of settlements. And the use of settlement, like what was once expanding [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3981.36s)]
*  settlements as part of a negotiation tactics, tactic towards what would ultimately have been [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3985.92s)]
*  a solution is now just a plan to take over the West bank. Yeah, no, it's developing bantustans, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3989.44s)]
*  which they did. And my point is that that has made it virtually impossible for a two state solution [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3993.52s)]
*  to exist, which is why I think that like Israel already maintains sovereignty and that as an [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=3998.6400000000003s)]
*  apartheid state, what needs to happen is to abolish the apartheid. So Hassan is a fascist. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4002.08s)]
*  Aha. We all believe in violence at the end of the day, right? What are you saying? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4006.1600000000003s)]
*  I just said, if you want to come over and suck my commies, I'm not interested. Okay. I like that [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4009.76s)]
*  you not so subtly threatened me with death and then immediately are like, Oh, you seemingly are [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4016.88s)]
*  a fascist and all you know is violence. Like what kind of pussy shit is this? The fuck? That's a [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4023.36s)]
*  crazy fucking that's crazy. Backtracking is totally on site. Cope it's coming for you. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4028.88s)]
*  And you helped create this atmosphere. It's totally on site for commies like us on literally [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4034.7999999999997s)]
*  unbanned four minutes later. So was on is our fascist. We all believe in violence at the end [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4040.24s)]
*  of the day, right? Fucking idiot bitch. Which is something that unfortunately many Israelis [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4045.6s)]
*  refuse to reckon with at least right now, because they, that would mean 5 million Palestinians. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4053.04s)]
*  And including the 2.5 million Palestinian cities of Israel would now constitute a demographic [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4058.9599999999996s)]
*  majority in this area in this, in this land that Israel enforces sovereignty over. And that is [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4063.52s)]
*  terrifying for its demographic destiny, its demographic goals in general. Well, just also [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4068.24s)]
*  it's it like, okay, that's something to add, like you can point like, it's also something that [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4073.36s)]
*  Israel is never going to ascend to. No, I understand that. Which is why I think like the pressure [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4078.72s)]
*  campaigns, albeit, you know, minimal, but the the change in attitude in the way that like a lot of [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4082.72s)]
*  people see this dynamic is is significant. And I think that inevitably, inevitably things will [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4089.12s)]
*  change. And we're seeing it right now. We're seeing it with the ICC decision. Like this is, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4095.52s)]
*  this is a truly unique moment. We're seeing with the ICC court case. We'll see where it goes. But [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4098.8s)]
*  I think that I understand why even members of the State Department that I would directly be at odds [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4103.76s)]
*  with in the way that we examine the world have have from the start, tried to say, this can't happen, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4109.599999999999s)]
*  that we need to use the liberal Zionist off ramp immediately. We need to just like, you know, put [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4116.24s)]
*  Benny Gantz in charge or something like we need to just like single out Benjamin Anya who say he's [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4121.5199999999995s)]
*  the bad guy and then move in the direction. Yeah, negotiation type is kind of crazy. Look, I gave a [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4125.28s)]
*  lot of I definitely was not going to to be super aggro on this conversation because it was like, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4129.84s)]
*  I was trying to be as nice as possible with as much grace as possible in the direction where like a [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4140.08s)]
*  more manageable, more liberal person, a more moderate person can be left responsible and [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4145.84s)]
*  restrain Israel in some way in order to continue Israel being an unsinkable aircraft carrier in a [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4152.08s)]
*  resource rich region. And I saw your rich comic clown enemy to free liberty, love and Americans. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4158.4800000000005s)]
*  You can be mad that your enemy recognize you, but it doesn't change anything. Playing dumb while [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4163.04s)]
*  holding a weapon, acting like it wasn't a veiled threat. Haha. You are a hypocrite brother. You [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4167.52s)]
*  literally said you're going to come to my house and try and kill me. You said it was on site. I [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4171.28s)]
*  think you misunderstood. You just saw, I don't know, you saw the fucking second amendment and [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4176.48s)]
*  it just like frustrated you for a second. I think that's what it is. That's not me being a hypocrite. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4184.08s)]
*  I have a right to defend myself. Don't you think? And they didn't even listen to that. Like, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4190.0s)]
*  but also because it was just didn't even listen to that. Because then Yahoo is an obstacle to [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4194.719999999999s)]
*  any kind of peace. I mean, this is a like we have been the PFP law. You need to see this. Oh my God. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4198.56s)]
*  That's what you look like. Brother, please have a family. Raise your kids. You should not be on [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4204.88s)]
*  fucking Twitch crying in a person's chat like this. Go talk to your fucking kids, man. What the fuck [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4212.400000000001s)]
*  are you doing? I never said I was coming to your house. Cope kid. Why are you acting like you didn't [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4220.72s)]
*  say it's on site for commies like you? Cope is coming for you and you help create this atmosphere. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4225.76s)]
*  And now you're like, I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. There's a reason why your kids are [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4231.52s)]
*  probably embarrassed of you big dog is because you know, you're doing this shit. Don't do this shit. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4236.08s)]
*  Also, I am noticing that you did not deny that you want to suck my dick. So that's cool. I don't want [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4240.96s)]
*  it. But you know, I will take it as a compliment. Being on the we have been in moments in the recent [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4246.320000000001s)]
*  past where we're Palestinians and Israelis were at the table and peace seemed within reach, right? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4253.36s)]
*  And that seems very far away right now. We were, we were away right now. But to me, that still [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4257.679999999999s)]
*  seems closer than a single state. And to me, there's that sort of a future of heading towards [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4262.4s)]
*  that is a future of a lot more chaos and violence and terror and horror. And so I come back to my [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4270.0s)]
*  view remains that like the future, that the only hope is some kind of a two state solution as far [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4276.96s)]
*  as that seems right now. People want to say otherwise fine. But I think they're gonna, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4282.48s)]
*  I think they're gonna annex the West Bank. I think that's what I think is gonna happen. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4287.839999999999s)]
*  But let's move. We got to get it. Trump is gonna let it happen. Like Trump, this is the thing, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4291.2s)]
*  like, and it's not even because Trump is like, ideologically committed to the Zionist project [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4295.919999999999s)]
*  in the way that like Joe Biden was. It's because Mary Maddison gave him $100 million. That's it. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4299.5199999999995s)]
*  Trump doesn't give a fuck. Yeah, he doesn't give a shit about anything. He's just like, yeah, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4303.839999999999s)]
*  these guys gave me money. I'm gonna, I'm gonna listen to her. And that's it. And that was really [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4307.839999999999s)]
*  funny because like that's what he's talked about in the in the anti-Semitism conference that he put [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4311.6s)]
*  together. If you recall, he was like, I've done so much for you Jews. Why won't you vote for me? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4315.280000000001s)]
*  That's what he kept saying. He's like, if I lose, it's because of you Jews. I know, I know. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4318.96s)]
*  And it was insane because like, in his mind, he thinks that's the only thing that American [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4321.76s)]
*  Jews care about. Like it's the, it's the dual loyalty trope, but you also can't do that trope [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4326.64s)]
*  in a woke way on mainstream media either. When you are, you know, not, I'm not saying you're [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4332.320000000001s)]
*  doing this, but you're saying like, you also can't do that in a, in a more woke way when you're [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4336.08s)]
*  talking about Israel in, in, as many liberal outlets do sometimes when they talk about like, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4339.52s)]
*  well, you know, you just want Israel to perish, I think. And you're probably anti-Semitic and that, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4343.52s)]
*  you know, it's just, Israel has demographic concerns. It's like, okay, well that's [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4348.88s)]
*  America has demographic concerns. America has white demographic concerns. That's not a con, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4353.360000000001s)]
*  that's a non-starter for me. You know what I mean? I don't care. Like, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4357.52s)]
*  yeah, I mean, there is also a ton of it. And that was, I think, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4360.56s)]
*  a important point that I, I wanted to land there as well. Am I being too subtle or is it coming [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4364.4s)]
*  across? I mean, this is not the best audience to ask because you guys know what my perspective is, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4373.04s)]
*  but I know, I know you, I know. I just want to make sure. Yes. And yeah, it's like rocketing [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4377.92s)]
*  and like that, but like, again, like I just, we got to move on from this, but like it's just [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4383.92s)]
*  that you see it in our politics. You see it in politics around Israel, like this kind of vicious [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4387.28s)]
*  circle of people feel under threat. They turn inward. They become less and less empathetic [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4390.64s)]
*  towards their neighbors. That leads them to be more and more isolated. And to me, it's like, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4396.8s)]
*  the question is not like, I don't like, I'm not even interested in like philosophical [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4400.400000000001s)]
*  debates, ideological, how do you break that human cycle? Right. And I think on our side, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4404.64s)]
*  it starts with just a, like a, a policy that right, like that recognizes that even if, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4410.64s)]
*  uh, that it is in Israel's interest to stop the violence and to stop the killing and that moving [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4417.36s)]
*  towards something like the annexation of the West Bank or the permanent occupation of Gaza or [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4422.16s)]
*  whatever it may be is ultimately not in Israel's interest. I know that that makes me sound like a [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4426.16s)]
*  neoliberal, but that is what I think. No, I understand where you're coming from. I don't [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4430.08s)]
*  disagree with you. I think that that's why I was trying to bring it back to like American politics [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4433.599999999999s)]
*  and, and I don't think it's an accident that in the past three decades, every single Western [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4437.2s)]
*  capitalist nation, uh, firmly planted within the heart of empire, firmly within the, the, uh, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4444.4s)]
*  the comfortable bosom of American imperialism has shifted dramatically to the right. And in that [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4451.44s)]
*  process, I think, or leading up to that, there was a lot of austerity, a lot of clawing back of social [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4457.84s)]
*  safety nets, a lot of, uh, privatization that took place that, uh, some people call the [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4462.56s)]
*  inshittification of the economy or the inshittification of everything. Um, and in that process, I think [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4467.12s)]
*  people got more and more angry and the only people that benefit from that anger are always [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4471.76s)]
*  going to be far right figures that can point to people that are defenseless and people that are [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4478.16s)]
*  less powerful than you are. Uh, and, and they were able to successfully use the anger to redirect [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4483.280000000001s)]
*  that towards nationalist sentiment, to redirect that towards racism, homophobia, bigotry of all [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4490.8s)]
*  different sorts. And that's why you're seeing the reform movement grow in the UK, uh, with Nigel [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4496.24s)]
*  Farage, who now has a higher approval rating than the, the very conservative, uh, Tory adjacent [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4501.28s)]
*  labor leadership when Keir Starmer. That's why you're seeing the AFD grow in momentum in Germany. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4507.36s)]
*  That's why you're seeing the Le Pen's party, uh, you know, when, uh, or also grow as well. Uh, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4512.5599999999995s)]
*  even if she goes to jail, her, her movement will not, you know, go away. And every single, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4518.88s)]
*  in every single instance you have centrist, moderate, moderate to like, how is QD running [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4523.36s)]
*  late, bro? Why does chat know she's running late is fucking the podcast isn't an hour. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4528.56s)]
*  It's in 40 minutes. How is she running late? Is she still streaming? She's still making food. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4538.240000000001s)]
*  She's cooking for 17 people. God damn, like center, right. Tell her to fucking end her goddamn stream [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4543.84s)]
*  right now and start driving neoliberal neoliberal party leadership, constantly trying to maintain [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4550.080000000001s)]
*  the hegemonic status of neoliberalism and losing out to populist far right messaging every step [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4556.96s)]
*  along the way. Because when material conditions worsen, okay. And you might look at the tech [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4562.4s)]
*  technological improvements and say, what do you mean material conditions are worsening? Like [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4567.04s)]
*  I can order an Uber Eats and immediately have it in my doorstep. But like overall, uh, the, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4569.6s)]
*  the important things like educational attainment, healthcare, uh, public transit, if we're talking [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4575.2s)]
*  about Europe, we don't even have that here in America. Um, and you know, homeownership, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4579.44s)]
*  these sorts of things are just getting worse and worse year over year. And it truly ruins [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4583.52s)]
*  people's lives and it leaves them angry and confused and right wingers like Donald Trump [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4587.68s)]
*  or fascists like those in Europe, like Maloney's party in Italy as well, or Gert Wilders in the [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4592.4800000000005s)]
*  Netherlands. Like these guys use that opportunity to say, you know why you're mad? Cause Muslim [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4597.040000000001s)]
*  refugees came in and they ruined your beautiful European culture. It's, it's the challenge, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4601.92s)]
*  right? Is that like things aren't getting worse on every metric. They're not. And if you were to [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4606.320000000001s)]
*  look at the last, I don't know, 50 years of American politics and you're, if you just showed [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4610.08s)]
*  people the economic data and you say, I want you to find on this chart where the United States [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4614.08s)]
*  elected a fascist dunce, you would not pick 2024. You would pick, you would, you might pick, uh, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4618.8s)]
*  2008. You might pick, uh, 1992. You might pick, uh, after the stagflation of the seventies, you [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4624.08s)]
*  might, there are a bunch of times you might say, well, that, that must've, if it's someplace here, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4631.04s)]
*  it must've been then. And so I do think like we have to, I think housing is a big part of it. I [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4634.08s)]
*  think people being furious that life didn't seem to come, like people are, I think, traumatized by [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4637.6s)]
*  the pandemic in ways we're still kind of, it's hard to see and hard to find in polling, right? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4642.08s)]
*  I think there's like a deep anger about like, Hey, wait, things never got back to normal. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4646.56s)]
*  I don't feel normal cost. Didn't come back down. Life seems worse in, in measurable and [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4651.04s)]
*  immeasurable ways. And I do think part of it is like, yes, it's material, but it's also, I think [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4655.280000000001s)]
*  spiritual. It is, it is. There is something, there is something. I think that there was a bargain [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4660.0s)]
*  people were making when all the restaurants where they knew the owners closed and they were [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4663.84s)]
*  placed by fucking Panera breads and subways and chains. And when their supermarkets became [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4667.52s)]
*  chains and the Walmarts came in, right. When people like to blame Walmart, but Walmart is both a [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4672.56s)]
*  symptom and a cause, right? I think like there was a bargain people made and the bargain was [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4675.76s)]
*  I'm going to give up on like the kind of dignity and community and sense of place and belonging [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4679.76s)]
*  that I used to experience in my town for these cheap, for this cheap stuff, but it better be [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4686.08s)]
*  fucking cheap. Yeah, it's not, but, but, but, but I think people are very bad at understanding [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4689.52s)]
*  what they want and people, I do think that there's this collective feeling of like, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4693.92s)]
*  Hey, we traded something away to these corporations and some of it we did unwillingly. Some of it we [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4697.040000000001s)]
*  did willingly, but we're not happy with the outcome. And I do think that that's about community. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4701.360000000001s)]
*  Don't worry. I bring up the fact that right here, Chad is all chirping, saying alienation [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4704.72s)]
*  about, about, about meaning. Yeah. What you're describing, I mean, you're describing alienation, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4709.52s)]
*  but yeah, I am, but like, but, but that is a big part of it. But in the Marxian sense, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4713.92s)]
*  not like alienation and the normal understanding of it, but like, yes, you're right. Americans feel [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4716.8s)]
*  isolated. Everyone feels isolated. Everyone feels alienated. They feel alienated from their labor. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4720.320000000001s)]
*  And, and, and besides that, there is no, there is no sense of identity. And I talk about this quite [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4724.0s)]
*  frequently. Actually our, our consumption is the only marker for identity. Even guns is a, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4729.28s)]
*  is a very important political identity for a lot of Americans. That's consumption. That's, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4734.4800000000005s)]
*  that's no different than an expensive Gucci bag. Okay. It's actually more expensive in many [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4737.76s)]
*  instances and the culture that surrounds it is still ultimately at the point of consumption. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4741.2s)]
*  And when, when, when there is a hurdle in front of that, whether it's cost or because you just [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4745.52s)]
*  simply can't go and buy it at the store or whatever, during COVID and the lockdowns, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4750.56s)]
*  everything falls apart because we're a very fragile nation that is built on this idea that like, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4754.64s)]
*  as long as I get shit for cheap, I'm fine. I don't really care. As long as the cost of eggs will go [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4759.200000000001s)]
*  down, you know, 20 cents or a dollar. I don't care if 20 million migrants get deported is the [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4763.120000000001s)]
*  calculation that some people made. And many people said it's not going to happen anyway. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4769.280000000001s)]
*  Now there is the other side of the story. That's why I want to hear the other side, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4772.72s)]
*  but I just want to just add. The other side is what I was trying to say is this is what, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4776.4800000000005s)]
*  this is what Kamala Harris did wrong in my opinion. She, she could have gone up there and said, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4779.04s)]
*  I am going to arrest the Walton family. And if that, and if she was able to successfully say, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4782.56s)]
*  I'm going to arrest the Walton family and they're going to stand trial. Okay. In a military tribunal [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4787.84s)]
*  and that is going to make egg prices $5 cheaper. It's going to be eggs are going to be 10 cents [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4792.4800000000005s)]
*  again. Americans would have voted for that. That's my point. So you don't have to go that crazy. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4797.4400000000005s)]
*  Obviously. No, I know. I know. Well, I guess it just like this to me, like these are the twin [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4802.24s)]
*  problems of dealing with a fascist threat. One is keeping a big contractual progressive small [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4805.04s)]
*  L liberal movement together. The other is how you defend the value of institutions that don't do [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4810.96s)]
*  that. And like, I know you're being, I'm being hyperbolic. I'm exaggerating. I know you are. I [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4816.639999999999s)]
*  know you are. I know you are. I think that for far too long, uh, you know, uh, deregulation and, and, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4821.36s)]
*  uh, unconditionally supporting corporations and even having what you just described as like the, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4826.88s)]
*  the formative opinion on antitrust, like as long as the consumer is happy, as long as the prices [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4831.28s)]
*  are low, we don't care if you monopolize. That's the right, that's the right view. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4834.5599999999995s)]
*  We like Democrats are now fight, fight like nobody. This is like, we're fighting back on that stuff. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4837.2s)]
*  No, but so that was the, that was the right view, but that was kind of uniparty for a very long time. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4840.32s)]
*  I think the right, I think the, the, the, but this is like, this is, I think conservatives had an [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4844.32s)]
*  ideological view of this. Yeah. The Bork view of this, they came in and they said antitrust doesn't [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4848.5599999999995s)]
*  mean what it says in the law. It doesn't mean what it says in people's experience of what a monopoly [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4852.96s)]
*  does. It's this one specific definition, which makes it really hard to stop mergers. And Democrats [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4856.48s)]
*  said, wait, hold on, like kind of Democrats just didn't have a strong view on this. It just wasn't [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4859.92s)]
*  a motivating. It wasn't, it wasn't. Why, why didn't they, well, I think they first of all, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4863.04s)]
*  I think there wasn't, I think that like, I think the intellectual academic left had to catch up to [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4866.08s)]
*  the damage this was doing. I think Democrats just didn't focus on it. Didn't care about it. I also [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4872.24s)]
*  think there is money from donors. Of course, of course I'm not, I know you don't need to [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4876.0s)]
*  rhetorically cue me up. I know. But, but that's like, I think sometimes it is, I think it is not [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4879.12s)]
*  people saying, oh, I wish we would go after these giant monopolies more, but I got this donation. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4883.28s)]
*  So now I'm not, but it's a culture, a kind of pro-business culture, right? That like kind of [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4886.48s)]
*  pervaded Democrats since the nineties that made conversations about this kind of thing harder to [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4891.28s)]
*  have, which is different now because Lena Kahn is now the chair of the FTC, right? Elizabeth Warren [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4895.44s)]
*  created this consumer financial protection bureau, right? Like there has been a shift, but it, but it [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4899.12s)]
*  is both not a shift in people's actual understanding of what the democratic party is for. Because [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4903.28s)]
*  there's no, there's no immediate gratification that comes from that. And the immediate gratification [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4906.959999999999s)]
*  that, that is supposed to happen could happen potentially with a wide sweeping legislative [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4910.0s)]
*  agenda changes overall, or like a clearly communicating a pathway towards like a more [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4915.52s)]
*  just outcome for healthcare, for example, like that's not something that we're invested in, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4920.080000000001s)]
*  like things that touch people's lives immediately is, is going to yield very positive benefits. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4923.280000000001s)]
*  I will say this. I think as far as, as far as like Lena Kahn or the consumer financial protection [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4928.4800000000005s)]
*  bureau, these are, these are fantastic things that happened under the, you know, the watchful eye of [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4935.040000000001s)]
*  the Biden regime. Well, Barack Obama. And Barack Obama as well. The problem here, however, is that [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4940.0s)]
*  once again, I think out of genuine fear, maybe that they would disrupt or upset the Tony West coalition [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4946.4s)]
*  of the democratic party, all of these like major donors that donate to the democratic party, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4955.04s)]
*  they didn't do a good job even explaining what they were doing. And I'll tell you why, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4961.6s)]
*  just real quick, I just want to give you an example of the IRS, right? Joe Biden funded the IRS. Every [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4965.12s)]
*  dollar that goes to the IRS, I think is like what seven extra dollars or 30 up to 35, if I'm not [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4969.52s)]
*  mistaken, I don't know the exact numbers, but like every dollar that you spend on the IRS, you get 35 [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4973.84s)]
*  in return and America's coffers, right? That's massive. That's fantastic. Republicans hate that. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4977.040000000001s)]
*  They hate the IRS and many Americans also hate the IRS as well. They hate paying taxes, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4982.400000000001s)]
*  partially because they get, they don't see anything in return for it. And even though the IRS, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4986.8s)]
*  getting more funds actually retrieved a lot of, you know, tax dodgers that were refusing to pay [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4992.080000000001s)]
*  taxes. And on top of that, their investigations concluded that I think Coca-Cola was head of [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=4997.44s)]
*  voided or head of aided taxes to the tune of $16 billion, right? One company. I never heard [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5002.96s)]
*  that from the Biden administration. They never went out and said, this is why we funded the IRS. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5008.24s)]
*  Yeah. Not because we want to come after you and your trailer, okay? In the trailer park [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5012.32s)]
*  with our armed agents or whatever. Republicans on the other hand were like 85,000 armed agents are [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5017.44s)]
*  coming to your house. They're going to kill you. They're going to take away your children and [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5021.04s)]
*  they're going to take your guns and they're going to take your trailer park. Look, I [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5023.839999999999s)]
*  think we paid for not having an effective communicator in the president. Like I think [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5027.5199999999995s)]
*  we paid dearly for that. It's not just the president. I know it's not just the president. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5031.12s)]
*  I know it's not just the president. People who judge us, attack dogs, sink them on every television [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5033.12s)]
*  show. I think I do think part of the challenge is a lot of people are talking about what these [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5037.2s)]
*  agents would actually do. It just doesn't get covered, doesn't get attention, just doesn't [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5039.679999999999s)]
*  matter. People don't cover this kind of stuff. That's a problem. That's part of it. I'm not [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5041.839999999999s)]
*  saying there aren't Democrats. I agree with you. Democrats need to have a kind of combative, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5044.16s)]
*  like if that's anything we take away from Donald Trump becoming president is that clearly we need [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5049.44s)]
*  somebody. People want a fighter. They want a fighter. They want a fighter. And you can't [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5052.96s)]
*  fight for opportunity economy and $50,000 in tax credits for startups. That is not something to [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5056.24s)]
*  fight for. You need to be a fighter and you need to fight for things that are universally good [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5060.48s)]
*  and that people want. Healthcare, fixing the housing market, things like that. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5065.679999999999s)]
*  Well, she did do that. I agree with you. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5069.679999999999s)]
*  But again, even her communication on that is like so much of the Democratic party is now officially [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5071.44s)]
*  captured by what we would look back in the past as unimaginably right-wing economic policies, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5076.5599999999995s)]
*  like tax cuts and a public-private partnership. When I hear those words, I'm like, I'm not regime [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5082.8s)]
*  pilled. I want to be regime pilled. I want to champion the social democratic regime. I want to [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5089.12s)]
*  make the Democratic party make Olaf Palme look like a fucking revisionist right-wing reactionary. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5097.28s)]
*  That's what I want. I want trains. I want trains. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5104.08s)]
*  I want better public transit. Better transit. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5106.56s)]
*  I want socialized housing. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5109.679999999999s)]
*  See, but you're stopping. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5113.36s)]
*  I don't know, but what do you mean? We can't get into it. We can't get out of time. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5114.24s)]
*  But what I'm saying is like- [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5117.2s)]
*  I'm for building millions upon millions of houses everywhere. That's what I'm for. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5118.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but no public-private partnership. Build it with federal publicly funded employees [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5123.599999999999s)]
*  and build it as a mechanism to claw back the insane housing market prices to lower them by force. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5130.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5137.92s)]
*  That's what I think. I think if you said that, a lot of Americans would be like, I like that idea. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5138.5599999999995s)]
*  I think if a democratic politician got out there and said, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5142.5599999999995s)]
*  we are going to employ millions of Americans, we're going to have a national jobs program to [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5145.44s)]
*  employ millions of Americans building millions of houses, I think that would be very popular. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5148.72s)]
*  I agree. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5151.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5152.0s)]
*  Okay. All right. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5152.48s)]
*  You're regime-pilled as well. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5154.24s)]
*  I am regime-pilled. Now, I did go on your feed yesterday to see what you've been up to. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5155.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5159.44s)]
*  And can we just put this up? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5160.08s)]
*  I think I know what you're going to post. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5161.76s)]
*  I was looking for what your reaction was to the Harris Campaign Podcast, and I just found this. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5163.36s)]
*  And I just thought, is this what the Joe Rogan of the left would post? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5168.96s)]
*  I think Joe Rogan posts. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5171.599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump wins, and you're like, I think I know what I need to do. I need to post whole. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5177.28s)]
*  You're getting good reactions to this. Is this getting you what you need? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5177.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I wanted to show my progress. It's been a while. That's like from 2021 until now. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5180.08s)]
*  I mean, I do talk about my fitness journey quite a bit. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5187.28s)]
*  You do Pilates? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5190.24s)]
*  What? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5191.2s)]
*  You do Pilates? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5191.44s)]
*  No, I train. I weight train, and then I play basketball. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5192.16s)]
*  What do you do in Ricardio? [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5196.8s)]
*  Basketball. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5198.08s)]
*  Basketball? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5198.48s)]
*  Yeah, I play basketball three times a week, sometimes four. And that's been very good. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5198.96s)]
*  I also track my macro nutrients. I track all my calories. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5203.92s)]
*  What does that do for you? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5209.04s)]
*  What do you mean? It's that right there. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5210.4s)]
*  You think that's what it's doing? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5212.5599999999995s)]
*  Picture on the right. That's how I got there. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5213.36s)]
*  You think so? Oh. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5215.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5216.48s)]
*  I use Manjaro. It's awesome. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5217.04s)]
*  Oh, nice. I have family members that use it as well. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5218.88s)]
*  And it's been very helpful. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5221.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have to think about it anymore. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5223.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's great. It's fantastic. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5225.280000000001s)]
*  Do you feel like it's stopped your other addictive tendencies as well? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5226.72s)]
*  I'm a better driver. Isn't that weird? [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5230.8s)]
*  Maybe because you're not on your phone or something? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5233.360000000001s)]
*  No, I think it's because I'm not spending so much of my mental energy on diet. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5235.120000000001s)]
*  And so I'm just a little bit less spent and kind of impulsive around other things. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5243.52s)]
*  And so I don't feel some need to get home two minutes faster. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5250.56s)]
*  It's hard to explain. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5254.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't feel as much of a need to find justice on the roads. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5256.080000000001s)]
*  I understand. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5259.6s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5260.0s)]
*  Yeah. You asked me. No, I 100% get it. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5260.88s)]
*  You asked me why you track your calories or whatever. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5263.6s)]
*  I get a lot of comfort from the rigidity of my schedule, my regimen. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5268.160000000001s)]
*  And I don't even think about it because it's just a habit that I have at this point. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5272.400000000001s)]
*  And for that reason, it's not even a thing I think about at all. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5276.64s)]
*  It doesn't weigh on me. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5280.5599999999995s)]
*  But when I was eating in a very unhealthy way, it did constantly weigh on me. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5281.36s)]
*  I was like, oh, but it feels so good. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5288.4s)]
*  I know. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5290.48s)]
*  But also it's so bad for me. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5290.8s)]
*  I feel like you get that a little bit hopeless. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5292.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5295.04s)]
*  True in politics too. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5296.4s)]
*  For sure. I mean, definitely. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5298.08s)]
*  But you've got to focus on whatever small victory you can have. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5299.84s)]
*  And it's the same for fitness. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5304.24s)]
*  And like I said, going back to the Joe Rogan to the left conversation, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5305.599999999999s)]
*  this is definitely... [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5310.48s)]
*  Munjaro is Ozempic. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5311.599999999999s)]
*  Something that I talk to my community about quite a bit. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5313.5199999999995s)]
*  And there's a lot of people in my community that have also gone on their own fitness journey. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5316.5599999999995s)]
*  I've been able to inspire them to do this as well. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5319.92s)]
*  And I think it's important to be physically healthy. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5322.5599999999995s)]
*  I do like just to close this out because we've gone on too long. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5325.679999999999s)]
*  But there is something about... [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5328.5599999999995s)]
*  In terms of meaning and a spiritual... [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5331.76s)]
*  I think there's a reason that there's been an appeal of people like the Jordan Peterson's [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5335.2s)]
*  of the world and some of the kind of more self-help right-wing types. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5340.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5344.96s)]
*  And I do think there are a lot of people out there looking for [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5345.76s)]
*  not just sort of answers in politics, but answers about why does... [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5350.96s)]
*  I feel unfulfilled. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5356.08s)]
*  Working, not working, whatever it may be. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5357.28s)]
*  I feel like I'm missing community and the kind of leadership that would come from community. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5359.28s)]
*  Bro, this is what she's doing? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5365.44s)]
*  And that's why she's late? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5366.72s)]
*  God damn. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5367.68s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5368.64s)]
*  I do think that's why sometimes you see... [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5370.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5372.4800000000005s)]
*  Even on the shows we do, I do feel like there's a hunger for something broader than just a [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5373.200000000001s)]
*  political program, but more of a kind of way of grappling with the fact that this version of [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5378.0s)]
*  modern life kind of dares us to ruin our own lives. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5385.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5389.280000000001s)]
*  I offer that in my broadcast every day. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5391.04s)]
*  I talk about my own personal journeys and I offer advice. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5396.08s)]
*  I used to have an advice segment as well. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5400.24s)]
*  I haven't done it in a while, but I'm going to bring it back. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5402.24s)]
*  And that's why I also collaborate with other content creators, even if I don't align with [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5405.599999999999s)]
*  them politically, agree with them politically at all. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5409.12s)]
*  But there are plenty of people that I know who are my friends, who I think, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5411.28s)]
*  as long as they're relatively charitable and good and kind people, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5415.679999999999s)]
*  even if we don't agree on everything politically, it doesn't matter. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5419.28s)]
*  And I find myself in these bro spaces a lot. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5422.72s)]
*  I've been on almost every single podcast that Trump has been on. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5426.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5429.76s)]
*  And many of them are run by my friends, like Impulsive. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5430.24s)]
*  My buddy Mike Malak is Logan Paul's... [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5434.56s)]
*  I was not the biggest fan of Logan Paul, but I love Mike. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5436.96s)]
*  Mike is a fantastic human being. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5439.6s)]
*  He has an incredible journey of overcoming addiction and he wrote about it as well. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5441.84s)]
*  He had a New York Times bestseller. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5448.320000000001s)]
*  Bradley Martin with the Nelk Boys. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5450.0s)]
*  I don't really know the Nelk Boys, but Bradley Martin I like a lot. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5451.68s)]
*  He owns Zoo Culture. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5454.32s)]
*  He's a real meathead. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5455.28s)]
*  And Andrew Schultz as well. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5458.72s)]
*  I've been on that podcast too. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5461.04s)]
*  A lot of these podcasts I've been on as well. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5463.04s)]
*  And these guys and their audiences are receptive to what I have to say. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5464.48s)]
*  And I think optics play a role in that for sure. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5469.12s)]
*  The way I carry myself, the way I am naturally, authentically, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5471.68s)]
*  I think is a package that young men are not immediately dismissive of. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5476.0s)]
*  And I'm very aware of that and I try to use that for good. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5482.8s)]
*  And I try to use that to explain to people that it's not cool to shit on random people [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5485.4400000000005s)]
*  for no reason. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5490.56s)]
*  They're like, let them live. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5491.12s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is this to you? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5491.92s)]
*  It's not going to fix your life. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5493.2s)]
*  You're being kind of a loser, an entitled little loser, and it's not good. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5494.88s)]
*  And that does work. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5499.68s)]
*  Boss baby energy. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5500.64s)]
*  It works. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5501.68s)]
*  And I think the size of my community now and the makeup of it is proof of that reality. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5502.16s)]
*  Like a couple years ago, I didn't have the numbers that I have now. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5509.76s)]
*  And every single person, virtually every single person in my audience will tell you [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5512.88s)]
*  that there is one key issue that I have dramatically changed their opinion on. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5517.92s)]
*  Whether it be American foreign policy, whether it be the way that they view trans people [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5522.48s)]
*  and we're transphobic, but now they're not, or even racist opinions. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5526.96s)]
*  So yeah, that's, that's what I try to do to the best of my ability in my little corner [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5532.0s)]
*  of the internet. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5537.6s)]
*  That's on biker. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5538.48s)]
*  Good to see you. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5539.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5540.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5540.24s)]
*  When we come back, Congressman Seth Moulton. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5541.2s)]
*  I hope it was good. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5543.12s)]
*  You know, I think it was decent. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5544.32s)]
*  I mean, I definitely toned it down a bit, especially on the Israel's front. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5546.08s)]
*  And there was a bunch that was cut out, I think, from that conversation too. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5549.84s)]
*  But, but not, not too much, nothing like nothing crazy. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5553.2s)]
*  I think they just like cut it for one to save my ass really. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5556.24s)]
*  Cause I said some, I said some stuff about Ryan Ruth. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5560.0s)]
*  Now let's look at the, let's look at the comments. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5563.6s)]
*  Let's look at the comments. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5565.68s)]
*  Please don't remind us about Dan's interview. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5568.56s)]
*  We are mad at you were mad at overpaid consultants who ever seem to do losing thing. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5570.08s)]
*  Such a contrast to that utter pablin from the other day, right from the jump, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5573.84s)]
*  they're more hostile Hassan than they were to the people who blew this. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5576.88s)]
*  I don't think they were that hostile. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5579.68s)]
*  The democratic party needs serious performance bloated without a touch of consultants and [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5581.12s)]
*  talking hands, trying to justify their jobs, leading losing campaigns and not listening [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5584.08s)]
*  to the working class. He was right before he's right now, the damn thing, the growth [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5587.12s)]
*  spine and not be door mats. This guy's good at articulating his ideas and desires for [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5589.92s)]
*  people in America and around the world. People will call him idealistic, but not only is [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5593.92s)]
*  what they was that what we need. He backs it up with bountiful evidence. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5597.04s)]
*  Got to admit this guy knocked out of the park. By the way, I feel by the party in the direction [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5600.4800000000005s)]
*  it's gone since 2009. Why does he understand me better than the people who are paid millions [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5603.52s)]
*  of dollars to do damn like that guy is probably not a, a Hassan Abbey head just writing a fake. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5607.04s)]
*  So glad you have a song on his mainstream. Doves, watch and listen to you. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5613.92s)]
*  Must understand the obvious. This is on articulates. This has song guys seems to [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5616.48s)]
*  really know what he's talking about. Glad to see someone accurately diagnosed the democratic party's [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5619.92s)]
*  issues. Where has the party of FDR gone? That's crazy. That's good. Who is this guy in Kenny [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5623.36s)]
*  run in 2028? Seriously? He's brilliant. I totally agree with this Joe mansion blaming. And if it's, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5632.48s)]
*  if I'd known all that stuff, I would have made it public. Thank you for this best. I felt in three [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5637.28s)]
*  weeks says our Kansas vote blue. These are like liberal moms, dude. God damn. You got two zimpaks [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5641.2s)]
*  on the table. Yo, can you get the door? I don't know. It's probably my mom. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5648.639999999999s)]
*  Gabe. Yeah. Go show some love to the, to the interview. Thanks for having me on comment. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5653.679999999999s)]
*  Boom. That's crazy that this is like popping off, dude. The pod. John's the audience loves it. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5662.48s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah. They love him. I watched the whole thing. You did not want the whole thing. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5668.719999999999s)]
*  You're such a liar. Why are you? I was listening to the whole thing. Why do you lie all the time? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5674.08s)]
*  I was listening to the whole thing in the other room. You're really doing a disservice. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5678.08s)]
*  You're doing anti-gay propaganda, really ordering on the BDS lists and delivering so much BDS food [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5683.04s)]
*  to that. I don't know what BDS stands for boycott the vestment and sanctions. Okay. Just sitting [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5688.639999999999s)]
*  secretly in a corner mischievously ordering BDS. Everyone is praising the same leftist garbage. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5693.44s)]
*  Please send them to run for office. Another win. This is a, I like that. The Republican is, is, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5698.32s)]
*  is why a Republican pod. John watcher. The fact that John is more combative with the son who had [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5704.0s)]
*  nothing to do with the democratic strategy. And then Dan and his discussion with the Harris campaign [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5708.4s)]
*  is the exact problem with liberal media. When it's on this approach of talking about real material, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5711.12s)]
*  I thought John was not that combined. I thought John love it was not that combative with me. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5714.32s)]
*  Maybe it's because I'm so used to people being unimaginably combative with, with most of the [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5721.76s)]
*  things I talk about that, like, I didn't think that way at all. Love it was very agreeable, [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5727.92s)]
*  but it took every bone in his body to not shout you down. And I think anyone who watches PSA can [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5733.76s)]
*  clock it. Maybe I'm so used to people. Yeah. I'm so used to people just being like, dude, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5737.52s)]
*  you're a fucking terror loving anti-Semite that wants to kill every Jewish person. Shut the fuck [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5742.88s)]

*  He's very quick to call for sending people to jail, but I do agree with them. The Democrats need to [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5839.68s)]
*  stop letting Republicans get away. This was months ago when I, this is before the election, when I [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5842.96s)]

*  like that. Part of me wants to resist that and take that energy and do some introspection [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5882.719999999999s)]
*  on the way that the democratic party has conducted itself and how these people have been lost [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5890.24s)]
*  because of the shortcomings of the democratic party as opposed to. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5896.0s)]

*  everybody because of this like bro, like culture. What I'm trying to say is, are these people, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5929.92s)]
*  are these people lost forever? No. Like can the democratic party message to these people? Yes. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5937.28s)]

*  Everyone can turn it around. I think it's ridiculous to make the assumption that people [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5952.639999999999s)]
*  are just like ontologically evil or just bad across the board. So you just gotta, you just gotta work [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5956.8s)]
*  your way. I mean, they arrived at this position. They didn't fucking, they weren't born into it. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5965.52s)]
*  You know, you just gotta keep working at it. And you gotta, it's discouraging to look around. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5970.320000000001s)]

*  wearing a camo shirt. Austin is just heterophobic. I was on Fox news as well. Let's take a look. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5980.160000000001s)]
*  Oh shit. They lost because they were, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5984.72s)]
*  some Democrats say they lost because they were scared of their donors. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5986.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that they need to change their policies. It's a policy thing. Yes. It's 100%. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5990.8s)]
*  By the way, the woman on screen has once called me a terrorist sympathizer. Wait, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=5996.64s)]
*  but she seems like she's using you as like, yeah. But yeah, now that I'm shitting on the dams, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6000.72s)]

*  Policy thing. Yes. It's 100% policy. I'm going to get so many, because I was like, right, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6010.16s)]
*  where's the boring glaze? Although it would be very subtle. Oh, for knowing, for knowing. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6014.16s)]
*  She called me a, yeah, she called me a terrorist supporter way back in the day when she was [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6020.0s)]
*  attacking. There's still 45 seconds left in the video. There's plenty of time for me to say, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6025.68s)]
*  I'm the left's Joe Rogan. The democratic party should give me millions of dollars. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6030.08s)]
*  That's not going to solve this problem. What will solve this problem is if the democratic party [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6035.04s)]
*  actually adopts real left-wing economic populist messaging instead of purposely avoiding that stuff [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6039.4400000000005s)]
*  because they're terrorists. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0OMkHD1ZM&t=6047.68s)]
