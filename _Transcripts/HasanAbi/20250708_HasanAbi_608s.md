# This Was Bigger Than Drama | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U)
*  So I'm proud of everyone that participated in the fundraiser. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm so proud to know so many wonderful people that literally went in and rushed to help Maya out. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=4.16s)]
*  Like Agent, Chris Nextdoor, Zoil, I think like Emeru's there now as well. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=14.36s)]
*  There are so many people. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=20.54s)]
*  Sena, S-Fan, so many people were like, oh dude, you know, this is a place where we need to go and help out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=22.14s)]
*  Maya is coming for your job. What is this? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=37.86s)]
*  She better not. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=41.14s)]
*  You're raising the next generation to hopefully protect nature. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=52.14s)]
*  You know, Kace, thank you for the sub. Thank you for the sub. Stress Wars, thank you for the tier one. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=56.14s)]
*  And it's just a really, really important time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=59.34s)]
*  Wearful, Rig Owens today, boss. Super niche question chat. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=61.34s)]
*  Probably won't care much from a colleague. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=64.54s)]
*  How many screens do you use for your travel setup streaming from the seaside right now struggling with three screens? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=66.14s)]
*  Two. I only have two screens. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=70.54s)]
*  That's crazy. You brought two extra screens? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  No, I have my laptop and I have an additional portable screen next to me. That's it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=75.54s)]
*  That's crazy that you have more than one, more than one extra screen. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=81.34s)]
*  One OBS, one chat, three content. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  No, I, I put my OBS and like all of the other stuff on the second screen and that's it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  And then one is the main screen that you see. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=97.94s)]
*  At most, if you want to like actively look at chat and chat alone, then I would suggest using your phone potentially. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=99.94s)]
*  Wait, shut the frick up. Is this real? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=106.34s)]
*  Okay, that's not real. That's that freaked me out for a second. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=110.74s)]
*  That's not real, right? Is it real? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=114.14s)]
*  Did she actually do that or did you guys Photoshop it? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=116.33999999999999s)]
*  Because I know she like noticed me, I think on. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=121.14s)]
*  Okay, let's do this. The Maya video. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=124.94s)]
*  Time to teach everybody. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=127.13999999999999s)]
*  Egg, thank you for the prime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=129.34s)]
*  It's just such a cool new way to do conservation work. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=130.54s)]
*  Garbo, thank you for the tier one. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=134.94s)]
*  It's such a cool new way to do conservation work. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=136.94s)]
*  And I think it's so powerful and I just like can't believe that I'm in the position to do it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=138.74s)]
*  She crying. That's crazy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=145.34s)]
*  It just means such. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=147.34s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=148.34s)]
*  What is what is she? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=155.34s)]
*  What is she saying? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  Cutie Cinderella talks about how she loves wine about it more than fear. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=157.34s)]
*  And I could start a new beef potentially with 100 thieves. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=163.34s)]
*  Valkyrie in her stead. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=168.74s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  But don't get it twisted. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=173.34s)]
*  I still have beef with Hassan one sided or not. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=174.84s)]
*  What I hate that guy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=177.34s)]
*  Broly look that way. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=179.94s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=181.34s)]
*  Dude, wait, I'll do it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=183.54s)]
*  What bro, did they fix the road in two days? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=184.94s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  They got so much help to dude. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna be honest. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=192.94s)]
*  I'm gonna be sincere for a second. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=193.94s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna be a little sincere. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=196.94s)]
*  Okay, obviously Maya is is a beacon of hope in this otherwise drama laden awful space on the internet that we occupy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=200.94s)]
*  But it's not just her alone and it's not the wonderful people over at Alveus who I think are amazing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=213.64s)]
*  It's not just like this unique way of showing the next generation the importance of animal conservation and wildlife preservation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=220.84s)]
*  I think that one of the things that I also love about what has taken place in the last couple of days is the fact that whenever horrible things like this happen, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  Devastating tragedies take place. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=244.64s)]
*  I do love that this community at least like our group of friends can very quickly get together and do something and enact change and we even bring the audience into it as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  And the audience also engages in the act of mutual aid as well. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=263.64s)]
*  And like this is what is the best part about twitch like all of the all of the drama all the bag and forth all the stupid shit is all completely irrelevant. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, because at the end of the day when push comes to shove or when situations require everybody to get together people spring in the action and the audience also springs in the action as well. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=282.44s)]
*  I obviously know this from my own personal experience too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=295.94s)]
*  When whenever there are horrifying events that take place and we do fundraisers and we very quickly are able to not only bring broad awareness to an issue but also also turn around and like fundraise to the tune of millions of dollars. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  It makes me very happy and very proud because I know that to the outside world to people that only like hang on to the drama and the toxicity and the awful back and forth mostly propped up by charlatans or self-interested to the outside world. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=316.64s)]
*  And like that's what streaming might look like but events like this one even though there's so much destruction taking place events like this one give me a little bit more hope it restores my faith in what I do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=335.64s)]
*  It restores my faith in humanity. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=348.74s)]
*  It makes me feel like this is not for nothing that there is a purpose that there is a some good that we can do in the world. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=351.74s)]
*  So yeah, that's what I wanted to say if you don't mind me getting a little sensitive for a moment, you know, so I'm proud of everyone that participated in the fundraiser. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=362.54s)]
*  I'm so proud to know so many wonderful people that literally went in and rushed to help Maya out like agent Chris next door Zoil. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=374.44s)]
*  I think like emiru's there now as well. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  There are so many people Sina as fan so many people were like, oh dude, you know, this is this is a place where we need to go and help out like especially for like agent and Chris like they're doing the AMP thing right agent and Chris are a part of this like massive AMP thing that was taking place. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=390.74s)]
*  Patty like anyone at peaches on the way as well. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=414.94s)]
*  So but like agent and Chris were doing this massive they got like the San Antonio. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=417.74s)]
*  They got Tony Parker San Antonio Mansion and they're like they had all this like content planned out and then and the agent was like yo I'm gonna go over there with Chris and I'm gonna go help. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=425.44s)]
*  It just makes me happy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=437.64000000000004s)]
*  It makes me it makes me happy that there is some semblance of humanity in this space because oftentimes because of the nature of content creation online the nature of content creation online. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=438.74s)]
*  We sometimes forget that there are real people that want to help out though like drop everything on a dime because like yeah, Betelgeuse. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  You're right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=463.64s)]
*  The space is so over saturated with heartless drama and rage baiting that it's sometimes easy to forget that kind of stuff, but it really helps me recenter my focus as well. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  God damn the Internet is so ass today in this in this what is happening here. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=473.74s)]
*  Maybe it's Twitter is probably just Twitter New York City losing power. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=477.64s)]
*  I am a little worried about that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=482.44s)]
*  My was on the weather channel about the flood. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=485.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=487.14s)]
*  Okay, we'll look at this in a second. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=487.84s)]
*  All right back to personal news now that I had that brief moment of interruption of feeling mushy gushy for a second. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=490.14s)]
*  Okay, never again will not I will not allow myself to get that way. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwtii2a__U&t=498.44s)]
