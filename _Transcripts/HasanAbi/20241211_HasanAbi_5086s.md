*  You're stationary in a car right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5.98s)]
*  No, because we're literally trapped in bumper to bumper [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=7.74s)]
*  traffic because it's Los Angeles. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  We are- [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=15.26s)]
*  Look at the camera. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=15.76s)]
*  We don't have the camera on you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=16.3s)]
*  Show me where you are. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=18.1s)]
*  See? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=19.14s)]
*  My camera's on. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  But here- [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=23.02s)]

*  Show me where you are. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=24.62s)]
*  We're literally, we haven't even gotten to like- [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=25.66s)]
*  We have just been sitting in traffic. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=29.4s)]
*  We're like about to be on Highland Avenue. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  M Competition, M4? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=38.12s)]

*  Yeah, you have a Toyota, bro. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=52.64s)]
*  No, it's a Beamer. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=54.120000000000005s)]

*  I know. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=61.26s)]
*  Like every time when I drove my M4, like a lot of Supras in the highways, they want [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=62.26s)]
*  to race with me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=66.74s)]

*  No, I don't trust that ship. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1657.02s)]
*  Plus Waymo is probably outside of the waymo distance. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1659.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1662.02s)]
*  March waymos everywhere. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1666.02s)]
*  Drop my car off at the car wash. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1669.02s)]

*  Okay. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1698.02s)]
*  You guys can be the test subjects of Waymo. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1699.02s)]
*  I mean, technically, I guess we're all test subjects of Waymo because they're on the road with us. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1701.02s)]
*  But like I'm good. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1708.02s)]
*  I'll take my chances. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1710.02s)]
*  I think it's pretty crazy that they just let that like we didn't vote on that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1714.02s)]
*  America is it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1719.02s)]
*  But now, oh, 100 percent. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1721.02s)]
*  I'm a Luddite. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1723.02s)]
*  It probably wouldn't have passed because I suspect that like a lot of a lot of Uber drivers, like a lot of people would probably vote no. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1725.02s)]
*  Would you vote yes for Waymo? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1732.02s)]
*  I can't do that. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1735.02s)]
*  I never try to. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1736.02s)]
*  I don't understand what is Waymo. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1738.02s)]
*  What is it? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1740.02s)]
*  Is the is those crazy cars that got like cameras on them and shit when you see them like rolling down the street? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1741.02s)]
*  They don't have a driver in them. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1747.02s)]
*  They're driverless cars like Uber. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1748.02s)]
*  Yeah, the Uber. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1750.02s)]
*  See, I can't trust. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1754.02s)]
*  No, but I would. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1756.02s)]
*  How slow I saw them. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1758.02s)]
*  Even if they had like a driver sitting there not touching it, I would be a little bit more comfortable. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1762.02s)]
*  But the fact that there's no driver at all, you can't trust the computer at all. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1767.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1772.02s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1773.02s)]
*  Like it's just ridiculous. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1774.02s)]
*  It's crazy to get into one and then just be like we have self driving cars straight. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1776.02s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like that. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1783.02s)]
*  You were like as a kid, you'd be like on the future cars and drive themselves. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=1785.02s)]

*  It's less than two miles away and it's 14 fucking minutes to get there. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4385.02s)]

*  We're going to get out of the car to go right back. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4394.02s)]
*  No, I'm living here now. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4398.02s)]
*  Actually, because I can't my body and my mind cannot withstand another. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4400.02s)]
*  Bro, this is just like Cambridge. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4406.02s)]
*  Yeah, this is literally Cambridge. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4408.02s)]
*  It was also a two hour journey to Cambridge. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4411.02s)]
*  At least we're in the van at that point. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4415.02s)]
*  And I was writing the speech, so I was preoccupied. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4417.02s)]
*  Oh my Lord. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4420.02s)]
*  Public transport actually would have been faster in L.A. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4425.02s)]
*  There is no fucking public transport. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4428.02s)]
*  Dude, 540 means we're going to be in the car for two hours almost. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4443.02s)]
*  It took us two total hours almost. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4448.02s)]
*  Baby girl move to Europe, move in with me, flirt. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4458.02s)]

*  Me driving would not have changed the destination. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4484.02s)]

*  How dare you disparage him? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4507.02s)]
*  There's a lot of flickering on the screen. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4513.02s)]

*  Thanks, chat. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4583.02s)]
*  I can't believe I pulled an agent on Jason. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4591.02s)]
*  Worse even. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4595.02s)]
*  No, agent was worse. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4597.02s)]
*  Wait. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4601.02s)]
*  Can we turn on the light again? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4608.02s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4610.02s)]
*  I'm thirsty as hell, too. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4616.02s)]
*  I ate all that. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4619.02s)]
*  I ate all that chicken. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4621.02s)]
*  Cooked dinner, ate, showered in your ass, is still in the car. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4626.02s)]
*  OK, calm down. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4628.02s)]
*  Just say you're on Filipino time. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4632.02s)]
*  Pinoy gang. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4634.02s)]
*  You don't happen to have waters, do you? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4642.02s)]
*  Water? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4644.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4645.02s)]
*  No, that's all good. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4646.02s)]
*  It's not illegal? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4657.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah, my dad used to always say you can't turn on the light in the car. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4660.02s)]
*  It's illegal. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4664.02s)]
*  My dad would say that, too. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4666.02s)]
*  That's just a lie. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4668.02s)]
*  It's not illegal. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4670.02s)]
*  I like that that's a universal parent lie, though. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4672.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4675.02s)]
*  Why do they do that? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4677.02s)]
*  It's like your immigrant parent thing. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4678.02s)]
*  That's so strange. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4683.02s)]
*  The other thing is, well, I don't know if your dad did this or not, but we were going on these long trips and my dad loves Gypsy Kings. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4691.02s)]
*  You know Gypsy Kings? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4703.02s)]
*  Gypsy Kings? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4704.02s)]
*  They're, it's like, I think, I mean, it's Spanish, but they're Roma. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4705.02s)]
*  And slur kings. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4717.02s)]
*  Yeah, OK, you take it up with them. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4720.02s)]
*  All right. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4721.02s)]
*  Like, that's insane. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4722.02s)]
*  We already gave the woke of the day to someone else. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4724.02s)]
*  OK. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4727.02s)]
*  So the thing is, I have PTSD from it because my dad on these long road trips would literally play the entire CD over and over again. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4730.02s)]
*  And he would change it so that the audio, because he would say that like it has to come from the back. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4749.02s)]
*  The music speakers has to come from the back. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4754.02s)]
*  So he would redirect the sound to the back speakers. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4756.02s)]
*  So me and Mara were sitting in the back just freaking out, hating this music. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4760.02s)]
*  Why is your dad evil? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4770.02s)]
*  I know he is. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4783.02s)]
*  My dad hit me. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4785.02s)]
*  You had it good, LaMau. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4786.02s)]
*  All right, dude. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4792.02s)]
*  Like, shit, I'm sorry that happened to you. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4793.02s)]
*  As our car lights would not turn off automatically and would drain car batteries. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4799.02s)]
*  So the lie was born. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4803.02s)]
*  Yeah, chatter was like, it's time for some trauma. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4808.02s)]
*  It's time for some trauma dumping. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4811.02s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4815.02s)]
*  We're five minutes out. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4817.02s)]
*  Fucking finally. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4819.02s)]
*  OK, is that my dad in the chat? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4829.02s)]
*  He's saying the light reflects from the windows and it is distracting. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4833.02s)]
*  Probably going to smack the hell out of you like Ron. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4856.02s)]
*  I know. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4859.02s)]
*  I started a small business in my first home already. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4872.02s)]
*  Damn. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4876.02s)]
*  How's that ever acts like you've never driven a car? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4880.02s)]
*  Law. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4883.02s)]
*  Also, you will never kill the battery with an engine running chatter. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4907.02s)]
*  Yeah, no, they mean like if you forget to turn it off. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4910.02s)]
*  If you forget to turn it off. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4916.02s)]
*  And you leave the car and you leave the light on. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4919.02s)]
*  Are you the type of guy that loves cars? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4930.02s)]
*  Not really. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4932.02s)]
*  Asana's no clue how bad it is for the average citizen. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4935.02s)]
*  I don't. You're right about that. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4938.02s)]
*  And that's because my whole life I have been able to avoid like I've always reversed commuted in L.A. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4940.02s)]
*  If you know, you know, real L.A. heads know what I'm talking about. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4951.02s)]
*  And then not only have I always reverse commuted, but also I don't have to commute anymore. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4961.02s)]
*  The commute is from my bedroom to my living room. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4968.02s)]
*  So anytime I actually drive somewhere in Los Angeles, it's like a far away distance. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4977.02s)]
*  I rarely ever. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4983.02s)]
*  I rarely ever have to drive around at the worst, most densely slammed L.A. traffic rush hour. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=4987.02s)]
*  The reason why we had these issues is because we're going from inside of the city to the valley. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5000.02s)]
*  And a lot of nine to five years live in the valley. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5006.02s)]
*  It's a little bit cheaper, but they work in the city where there's commercial real estate. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5009.02s)]
*  And that is precisely the reason why this is the absolute worst commute you could take. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5016.02s)]
*  We didn't. Oh, shit. With Jason, we're going to need three mics. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5025.02s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5030.02s)]
*  Did you bring the shotgun? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5033.02s)]
*  Thank God. All right. We'll swap it to the shotty. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5035.02s)]
*  We'll swap it to the shotty so people can be like, wait, I can't hear you. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5038.02s)]
*  I can't hear you well enough. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-9yMr5qP8&t=5044.02s)]
