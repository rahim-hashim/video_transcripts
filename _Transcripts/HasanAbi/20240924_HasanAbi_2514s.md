# Jake Tapper Distorts Rashida Tlaib's Statement | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU)
*  Jake Tapper read the quote. It's not like Jake Tapper doesn't have access to the quote. He read [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=0.0s)]
*  the quote and then just lied about what Rashida Tlaib said. He read the direct quote that Rashida [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=4.48s)]
*  Tlaib gave and then turned around and was like, well, she is Jewish. And Rashida Tlaib absolutely [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=10.96s)]
*  did this for CNN State of the Union. Wait, is that on the docket? Let me see. CNN State of the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=18.32s)]
*  Union, okay, is where Jake Ass Tapper had Big Gretch, Governor Gretchen Whitmer on to talk [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=29.2s)]
*  about what's going on in her state. Now, for those of you who don't know Gretchen Whitmer, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  governor of Michigan, has been in a little bit of trouble, I guess, or like a little bit of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=42.72s)]
*  controversy as a consequence of her attorney general prosecuting 11 people, nine anti-protesters [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=47.04s)]
*  and two counter protesters, okay, in the state of Michigan. Her name is Dana Nestle. Now Rashida [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=56.8s)]
*  Tlaib has of course been incredibly critical of this to be like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  You can't be protest. You can't be prosecuting anti-protesters. Like what the fuck is wrong with [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  you? Okay. And of course Nestle and others immediately looked to that criticism and said, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=74.32s)]
*  oh, Rashida Tlaib is saying that because Nestle is Jewish. The attorney general Rashida Tlaib [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=85.12s)]
*  personally believes that the attorney general Nestle is Jewish and that's why she charged [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  the pro-Palestinian protesters. Of course, of course, Rashida Tlaib never said that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  It is just completely made up. But not only is it completely made up, it was repeated by [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=105.12s)]
*  the obvious groups that you hear from in moments like this, groups that are noticeably quiet when [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=111.84s)]
*  Mark Robinson, who's running for governor of North Carolina, comes out and says like he's black [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=118.24s)]
*  Hitler or, and that he wants to own slaves or whatever. Okay. But groups that only seemingly [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=123.28s)]
*  sharp about someone who is pro-Palestinian. I'm of course talking about the ADL, also known as the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=130.96s)]
*  defense league, also known by the former name, the anti-defamation league. The ADL immediately [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=139.04s)]
*  came out and was defending not only Jake Tapper, but also claiming that Rashida Tlaib was claiming [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=145.76s)]
*  that Nestle is Jewish as the attorney general. And that's why she is against these anti-demonstrators [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=156.72s)]
*  at Michigan college, American college students. So here's a clip from that. I don't know if this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=163.92s)]
*  video is the full clip or how long did the full clip go for, or is this just about Trump? Is it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  just like anti-Trump? Anyway, let's just take a look at the state of the union. Attorney general, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  Dana Nestle charged almost a dozen individuals from the university of Michigan over the anti-Israel [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  protests among the charges, attempted ethnic intimidation or obstructing a police officer [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=188.64s)]
*  and, and on and on. These are pro-Palestinian protesters who were being punished and prosecuted. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  Michigan democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian, she called the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  charges from Nestle, who is Jewish, shameful. And Tlaib said, quote, it seems that the attorney [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=205.2s)]
*  general decided if the issue was Palestine, she was going to treat it differently. And that alone [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  Nestle who is Jewish. Like what difference does that make? You're the one who's saying it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=217.12s)]
*  Like what is this framing that if someone is a Zionist and also Jewish, you can't say that they [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=222.16s)]
*  are biased as a Zionist who is openly in defense of Israel. Like what, what is this? What, what the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=229.28s)]
*  is going on here? Like what it's so gross because she never even brought up, obviously never brought [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=235.84s)]
*  up the fact that Dana Nestle is Jewish. It speaks volumes about possible biases [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  within the agency she runs, unquote Nestle responded by saying, quote, Rashida Tlaib should not use my [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  religion to imply I cannot perform my job fairly. This has nothing to do with your religion and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=254.8s)]
*  everything to do with your biases. If you are out of all of the prosecutors in the nation, out of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=261.6s)]
*  all the attorney generals in the nation, the attorney general that is choosing to genuinely [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=268.8s)]
*  prosecute, okay, under democratic leadership, mind you, genuinely prosecute anti protesters [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  on a college campus, you're biased, you're insane. What the are you doing as attorney general? It's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=280.32s)]
*  and wrong unquote. Do you think that Tlaib's suggestion that Nestle's office is biased was [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=286.24s)]
*  Listen, Jake, you know what, all I can say is that I know that our Jewish community is in pain [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  as is our Palestinian and Muslim and Arab communities in Michigan. I know that seeing the, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=298.64s)]
*  you know, incredible toll that this war has taken on both communities has been really, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=305.36s)]
*  really challenging and difficult and my heart breaks for so many. But as governor, my job is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=311.68s)]
*  to make sure that both these communities are protected and respected under the law in Michigan [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=317.44s)]
*  and that's exactly what I'm going to stay focused on. But do you think attorney general Nestle is not [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=322.4s)]
*  doing her job because Congresswoman Tlaib is suggesting that she shouldn't be prosecuting [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=328.08s)]
*  these individuals that Nestle says broke the law and that she's only doing it because she's Jewish [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  and the protesters are not that's quite Is that what she said? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=338.64s)]
*  Jake Tapper, if that's what she said, why didn't the quote reflect that because you pulled the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  quote. The quote literally says prosecuting anti protesters in this unceremonious fashion [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=350.8s)]
*  implies that the office is operating on different boundaries than other attorney general's offices [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=358.64s)]
*  so far in the nation. Okay. I would call into question biases at play, understandable position [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=363.76s)]
*  to take at no point does she go Dana Nestle is Jewish and therefore biased towards Palestinian [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=371.6s)]
*  protesters or anything like that. Okay. And you know that she didn't say that, which is why you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=378.4s)]
*  read the quote of what she actually did say and then turned around and chose to lie about what [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  she said. Quite an accusation. Do you think it's true? Like I said, Jake, I'm not going to get in [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=392.08s)]
*  the middle of this argument that they're having. I can just say this. You know, we do want to make [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  sure that students are safe on our campuses and we recognize that every person has the right to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=402.0s)]
*  make their statement about how they feel about an issue, a right to speak out. And I'm going to use [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=408.56s)]
*  every, every lever of mine to ensure that both are true. Lying implies an intent to deceive. Jake is [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=413.67999999999995s)]
*  just really bad at reading. No, he is intentionally lying with the intent to deceive. Jake Tapper has [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=419.52s)]
*  historically been this guy anytime will be up is in display. Okay. Remember when he tried to do [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=426.88s)]
*  something similar with the UN general saying he never condemned 10 seven and only deleted his [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  statement after he was community noted. Yeah. Jake Tapper is sloppy in the way that he tries [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=437.52s)]
*  to propagandize these positions. He has notoriously been a major enemy to the likes of Ilhan Omar and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=443.52s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib far before October seven. He is one of the most biased and one of the biggest [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=449.84s)]
*  public assholes. Okay. It is ridiculous. Yeah. And now governor Whitmer is lying, adding to the lie [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  with the statement by the way. And here's the investigative reporter from Detroit Metro Times [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=465.6s)]
*  who actually covered, who actually interviewed Rashida Tlaib where the quote comes from. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  The journalist himself is literally here's the full remarks from the Detroit Metro Times, by the way, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  the article. This is a move that's going to set a precedent and it's unfortunate that a Democrat made [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=481.68s)]
*  that move. Tlaib said you would expect that from a Republican, but not from a Democrat. And that's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=486.24s)]
*  really unfortunate. It was very inclusive. It was diverse, very loving to leave a Democrat. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=491.44s)]
*  Detroit Democrat says when I visited, I remember they were talking about the Armenian and what we [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=497.36s)]
*  learned from that. It was very powerful. I wish University of Michigan president Santa Ono could [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=501.12s)]
*  see his students as people that just want to save lives, no matter their faith or ethnicity. We've [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=505.12s)]
*  had the right to dissent, the right to protest, Tlaib says. We've done it for climate, the immigrant [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=510.96s)]
*  rights movement for black lives and even around the issues of injustice among water shutoffs. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=515.84s)]
*  But it seems that the attorney general has decided if the issue was Palestine, she was going to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=520.24s)]
*  treat it differently. And that alone speaks volumes about possible biases within the agency [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=524.0s)]
*  she runs. Rashida Tlaib made no mention of attorney general Nestle's Jewish heritage. She suggested [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=528.8s)]
*  that there were possible biases against pro-Palestinian voices in her office based on [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=533.84s)]
*  her decision to charge the protesters. The false claim seemingly originated from an article published [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=538.16s)]
*  in the Jewish insider by chief editor, Josh Krauschar. Okay. Michigan attorney general Dana [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=543.6s)]
*  Nestle leveled the same false claims against Rashida Tlaib accused her of being, this was three [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=548.72s)]
*  days ago where she said what Jake Tapper showed on stream. Rashida's religion should not be used [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=552.32s)]
*  in a cartoon to imply that she's a terrorist is Islamophobic and wrong. Just as Rashida should not [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=558.48s)]
*  use my religion to imply I cannot perform my job fairly as attorney general. It is in wrong. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=562.64s)]
*  Anti-defamation league's director, Jonathan Greenblatt also repeated the blatant lie, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=567.12s)]
*  of course, saying Tlaib accused the attorney general of prosecuting protesters simply because [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=570.88s)]
*  she's Jewish. Completely made up. At no point did Rashida Tlaib say that. Now, American media [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=575.36s)]
*  and Western media in general oftentimes will ignore people that they are so, people that are [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=582.32s)]
*  harder to basically come by. If you're going to talk about like something that's happening, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=590.4s)]
*  it's harder to like talk to a Lebanese person that is getting, than it is to talk to, I don't know, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=594.24s)]
*  an Israeli fucking military official who has a direct line of communications to you anyway. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=599.44s)]
*  But in this circumstance, considering the domestic affairs here and considering who one of the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=604.16s)]
*  actors are, it's not so hard to get a quote from Rashida Tlaib, don't you think? Like, she's not [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=609.76s)]
*  some unreachable person. She's a US Congress person. What are you talking about? And I feel [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  that, you know, in the interest of due diligence and actually doing your duty as a journalist, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=624.4s)]
*  you probably should reach out to her at some point. She's not a random person. She's an [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=629.6s)]
*  American Congress person. And of course, Jake Tapper has done this so many times when it comes to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=636.0s)]
*  black and brown Congress persons, but specifically Muslim Congress person. He always gets away with [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=643.44s)]
*  it because Islamophobia is normalized in American society in especially the post-911 universe. That [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  is precisely the reason why he can say whatever the fuck he wants about Rashida Tlaib. Never [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=656.72s)]
*  actually do his due diligence, show his journalistic integrity, and actually go and reach out to her [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=661.12s)]
*  and be like, hey, you know, we reached out for comment, your office didn't respond or something [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=666.88s)]
*  like that. Bring her on to your show. Right? It is ridiculous. The original reporter replied directly [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=671.12s)]
*  to Jake's tweet, got 4.5 thousand likes. Okay. Here's Governor Gretchen Whitmer's statements, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=679.28s)]
*  suggestion that attorney general Nessel would make charging decisions based on her religion as [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=685.04s)]
*  opposed to the rule of law. Attorney general Nessel has always conducted her work with integrity [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=688.8s)]
*  and followed the rule of law. We must all use our platform and voice to call our hateful rhetoric [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=692.56s)]
*  and tropes, except Rashida Tlaib never did that. So does governor Gretchen Whitmer's statement also [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=696.72s)]
*  follow that up by saying and Congress person Rashida Tlaib never did that. This was a false smear [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=704.08s)]
*  in an effort to deflect away from a point of contention here on whether or not we should be [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=711.76s)]
*  allowed to prosecute college campus protesters who bravely say, you know, is wrong. No, they didn't. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=717.68s)]
*  Of course they didn't because everyone is a coward, ridiculous. Why is it about secretary of state [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=725.04s)]
*  nominee Blinken that makes the Congresswoman think he would try to suppress her views about [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=729.76s)]
*  the prime minister of Israel? Hmm. Just make sure he doesn't try to silence me and suppress [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=732.64s)]
*  my first amendment rights to speak out against Netanyahu's inhumane policies. You know, what's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=736.4s)]
*  really interesting is that she was right, I guess too early, but she was right. They did do that. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=740.0s)]
*  They censured her. They never censured John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=744.72s)]
*  for going on a Senate committee hearing on hate and conducting himself in a way where he just [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=752.8s)]
*  did a hate to an Arab woman. Okay. Or he kept repeating the position that this Arab woman was [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=759.6s)]
*  pro-Iran specifically pro-Iranian. He said over and over again, despite what her response was, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, our government never did anything about that because once again, Islamophobia is [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=773.92s)]
*  normalized. Islamophobia is considered appropriate. It is not considered inappropriate. Okay. Just [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  something to consider. It must be pure coincidence that this Talib quote is from a story 10 days ago [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=787.52s)]
*  whose author is now frantically trying to correct the record as Khrushchev Tapper pushed the smear [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  only got attention after to leave, got some sympathy for being the subject of a viciously cartoon. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=796.0s)]
*  Yeah. For the past six years and particularly over the last 12 months, there's been a relentless [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=800.64s)]
*  political and media campaign and marginalized to leave because she is the only prominent [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=804.48s)]
*  Palestinian American woman with a national platform. Even one is too much. That's absolutely what is [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=807.84s)]
*  going on for the record. That is precisely what's going on because Rashida to leave with stands a [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=813.2s)]
*  ton of attacks as a Muslim and a Palestinian Congress person to begin with. Same with Ilhan Omar, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  but the timing and the severity of this smear is very odd in comparison to like what the statement [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=824.72s)]
*  was, which they're lying about. And when the statement was actually delivered in Metro Times, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  it became a news story of national prominence and of national consequence only after the, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=836.24s)]
*  I think it was a national, what was it? One of these American publications like made an insane [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=842.64s)]
*  meme, a cartoon depicting Rashida as someone who's pager blew up because she is like [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=848.1600000000001s)]
*  a part of Hezbollah. I forget where it was. I think it was the national review. You know, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=854.4s)]
*  the exact type of commentary and jokes that you hear from the likes of Boner Chelly and his rabid [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=858.88s)]
*  fans, rabid Islamophobic fans when they make those same jokes about me having my pager blow up in my [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=864.8s)]
*  face or some because they only can fantasize about death and destruction to those who they have [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=869.68s)]
*  declared their enemies. Now, the expectation of course is that a news publication that has like [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=874.72s)]
*  broad circulation despite the fact that national review is a right-wing piece of establishment [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=882.64s)]
*  is that they're not supposed to do this. Like they can't just like very openly do this. This is like, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=888.88s)]
*  you know, making cartoon depictions of Barack Obama, which of course they have done as well. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=893.04s)]
*  Yes, national review is the guy. Yes, the guy who dropped the, we're talking about Haitians. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=899.84s)]
*  That is their editor. Okay. Thank you Mayor Abdullah Hamoud for speaking up. Our community [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=905.12s)]
*  is already in so much pain right now. This racism will incite more hate against the Arab and Muslim [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=910.32s)]
*  communities and it makes everyone less safe. It's disgraceful. The media continues to normalize this. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=913.5200000000001s)]
*  Like this is crazy. That's a sitting congress person, man. You have no respect for [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=925.12s)]
*  your own government to this degree. Like that's ridiculous. Anyway, obviously people were very [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=928.88s)]
*  frustrated when this came out. And then immediately people were like, let's scour the web to see if we [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=935.2s)]
*  can find a smear campaign. And they did and successfully launched this, this idiotic campaign [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=939.76s)]
*  against Rashida Tlaib over something she never said that the journalists who wrote the article [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=949.28s)]
*  is trying to fact check people over adding Jeremy Allen Moss directly, adding Dana Nessel directly, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=955.12s)]
*  adding CNN, adding Jewish insider, adding the ADL's Jonathan Greenblatt. Okay. And, and even [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=961.92s)]
*  adding Governor Whitmer and saying that she's adding to the lie, but it doesn't matter because [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=968.24s)]
*  the truth doesn't matter. Do you understand? We in the liberal side of the political equation like [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=973.28s)]
*  to think that we are above this kind of activity that, you know, only Republicans do this kind of [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=980.32s)]
*  thing. Only Republicans are so stupid as to believe these like false smears, right? No, liberals do [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=985.52s)]
*  that too, as long as it corresponds to their personal biases. And if being a liberal and being [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=991.76s)]
*  a supporter of the Democratic Party means that you have to be in support of like Israel's actions [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=996.24s)]
*  unconditionally, then sometimes you are going to deploy the cynical deflection mechanism of like [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1000.32s)]
*  false smears. That's it. That's it. And that's precisely what's going on here. It's completely [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1007.12s)]
*  unacceptable, but that is what is, you know, guiding the conversation at the moment. Now let's get to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1012.88s)]
*  the letter revealed from the Trump suspect. If you recall, I talked about American hero, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1020.4s)]
*  Mr. NATO, the number one NATO voter, Ryan Ruth. Okay. America's number one defender of Ukraine. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1025.6s)]
*  If, if Tim pool believes that Ukraine is the enemy of the world and specifically America due to the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1034.32s)]
*  money that he was getting from the Russian government, Ryan Ruth was getting no money [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1043.36s)]
*  from the Ukrainian government, but was still defending it way harder than anyone else I've [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1046.9599999999998s)]
*  ever seen. Brian Rue is a man that I like to call a go-getter. Okay. Not a lot of those left in, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1051.92s)]
*  in Western society. Oh man. Who says, guess what, dude? I like this. I'm going to do it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1059.8400000000001s)]
*  Now, I mean, that's it. He was very proactive and I'm not even talking about that. I'm talking [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1067.2s)]
*  about everything else he did. Okay. Went like, it was like, oh yeah, there's a big homelessness [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1072.16s)]
*  problem in Hawaii. I'm just going to build like those mini homes. Oh, there is a, there's a, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1076.88s)]
*  a rape that was happening all the way back in like 1991 or something. He was like, I'm going to go [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1082.96s)]
*  stop that rape. Okay. Is there, he's, that's the kind of guy he is. Okay. He saw something [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1086.64s)]
*  unjustifiable and wrong happening in Ukraine where Russia invaded Ukraine. He was like, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1091.7600000000002s)]
*  I'm going to go there. Okay. Maybe he was a bit of a crack head too, but Hey, listen, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1094.8000000000002s)]
*  still go-getter type guy. Oh, speaking of people lying, by the way, and continue along with those [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1100.72s)]
*  lies, predictably we have Dana Fash. Remember what we were talking about with respect to, here it is [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1106.9599999999998s)]
*  Dana Fash. A sad reality is everywhere and it comes from both ends of the political spectrum. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1112.9599999999998s)]
*  Let's hear what this fascist piece had to say on CNN. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1119.12s)]
*  And now to a sad reality and that is, is everywhere. And it comes from both ends of the [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1121.9199999999998s)]
*  political spectrum, but politicians sometimes sidestep calling it out when it comes from a [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1127.04s)]
*  member of their own party. We saw two examples on state of the union yesterday. First with Michigan [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1132.8s)]
*  governor Gretchen Whitmer, when my co-anchor Jake Tapp. Bro, they did this with Ilhan Omar back in [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  the day. They did this shit with Ilhan Omar back in the day. Okay. Straight up. They did this exact [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1143.92s)]
*  same shit with Ilhan Omar back in the day. Universal condemnation over something she didn't say that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1149.36s)]
*  was objectively correct. What she said was objectively correct. Okay. In terms of like [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1153.76s)]
*  lobbying, think about it. When Ilhan Omar was in the crosshairs and they were ripping her into [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1159.12s)]
*  shreds and the democratic party was like literally also participating in it. What was the major thing [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1164.0s)]
*  that she said? That the Israeli lobby has a tremendous amount of influence on the way that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1168.8s)]
*  legislation works. This is obviously the reality and it is so much so the reality that like now [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1174.0s)]
*  it's the reality that most people are aware of. Okay. And it's crazy. It's crazy that she said [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1180.64s)]
*  moneyed interests are what motivates a lot of American politicians. It is wild to me. It's wild [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1186.4s)]
*  to me that like people ripped her into shreds. They pulled older, older statements. They try to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1193.1200000000001s)]
*  make it seem like she was pro 9-11. You know, they pulled out all the stops and they've pulled out [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1198.48s)]
*  those stops on me as well. Something that I personally have seen too. And now they're doing [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1203.2800000000002s)]
*  it to Rashida Tlaib again. Okay. Jewish attorney general. Oh, wow, dude. I didn't realize it was [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1207.36s)]
*  like that. She never actually mentioned that she was Jewish. She never actually mentioned her [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1222.0s)]
*  religious or ethnic background whatsoever and simply said this decision coming from a [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1228.8799999999999s)]
*  Democratic attorney general is additionally bad. It's expected from a Republican, but what the [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1234.8s)]
*  Democrat doing this, I call in the question, the attorney general's office and how biased they are [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1240.0s)]
*  in this issue on the issue of Palestine in comparison to not behaving this way on any other [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1245.6s)]
*  issue where Democrats are supposed to be champions of free speech and free protest. Okay. I voted for [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1251.04s)]
*  Nestle at the 2017 MDP convention to be the attorney journey nominee for Dems. I learned this [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  month that she was Jewish. Yeah, like that's the other side of the equation that doesn't even [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1261.52s)]
*  fucking matter. Like it's just irrelevant. It's completely and utterly irrelevant to the subject [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1265.84s)]
*  matter, which is precisely why they are the ones who are putting it in there. Jake Tapper is the [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1270.6399999999999s)]
*  one who's like, she's Jewish. Letting her religion influence her job. Do you think that Tlaib suggests? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1275.2s)]
*  It's like funny because, bro, it literally at this point, this is like the Nazi canard [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1282.96s)]
*  of like, of just being like, oh, wow. Like I guess it's when you criticize a Jewish person for anything. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1289.44s)]
*  Like that's what Nazis are supposed to say. Okay. That's what Nazis say, right? You're not supposed [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1297.6s)]
*  to lean into that and use it as a defensive posture because when you do that, you're giving credence [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1304.16s)]
*  to Nazis. Okay. It is so goddamn annoying. It is so ridiculous that like they quite literally are [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1309.68s)]
*  doing that as a straight up defense mechanism where they're like, well, I guess you're criticizing [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1316.8s)]
*  a Jewish woman much. It's like, dude, what the are you talking about? What are you talking about? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1323.9199999999998s)]
*  That's insane. You can't do that. Like that is such a cynical deployment of as a shield at a time [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1330.56s)]
*  when it's skyrocketing. Okay. Like really not from the river to the sea, not the fake that ADL [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1338.24s)]
*  adds to pad the stats at a time when the stats are already alarmingly high as a direct consequence [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1344.72s)]
*  of people looking at what Israel is doing and go, what the they say they're doing this for Judaism. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1350.08s)]
*  Well, I guess Jews do control the media. That's a real and so many more Americans now than they did [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1354.3999999999999s)]
*  prior to October 7th, firmly are committed to that position. Okay. Firmly, firmly. So at a time [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1360.72s)]
*  when American Jews at a time when American Jews need a honest broker of the truth in terms of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1368.1599999999999s)]
*  incidents more than they ever have. Okay. The one outlet that is propped up by the media, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1376.56s)]
*  the one outlet that is propped up by the goddamn media is an institution that has coordinated and [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1384.08s)]
*  collaborated with the government of South Africa historically and has targeted American Jews that [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1390.7199999999998s)]
*  were protesters and still continues to target American Jews that are in anti-demonstrators. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1395.04s)]
*  And that's like the formative expert is like is an institution that is objectively in the tank [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1399.68s)]
*  for Israel's and nothing else. Very sad state of affairs. Asked in that Nestle's office is biased. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1407.36s)]
*  What was? Yeah. What was crazy about it is that, yeah, Jake Tapper read the quote. It's not like [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1413.04s)]
*  Jake Tapper doesn't have access to the quote. He read the quote and then just lied about what [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1418.1599999999999s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib said. He read the direct quote that Rashida Tlaib gave and then turned around and was [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1423.12s)]
*  like, well, she is Jewish and Rashida Tlaib absolutely did this for Felix brought up a good [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1429.6s)]
*  point by the way, Felix Biederman, of course, hold on. I'm going to pull this up. I mean, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  it's not even that crazy of a take, but it's like Jake Tapper would be fired or at least suspended [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1441.12s)]
*  if he lied this blatantly about almost anything else. Okay. Anything else, anything at all. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1446.24s)]
*  But this is a double Monte. It's both a cynical deployment of his defense shield. Okay. And also [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1452.48s)]
*  it is incredibly Islamophobic. So the way that he can do this, like when you hit both of those [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1459.4399999999998s)]
*  tunes, like no one, you're not incurring any penalties whatsoever. Okay. You're not getting [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1466.08s)]
*  any penalties for that whatsoever. It is the most normal process. It is the most normal thing you [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1471.28s)]
*  can do. It is the expected thing you do in media. Listen, Jake, you know what? All I can say is that [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1476.96s)]
*  I know that our Jewish community is in pain as is our Palestinian and Muslim and Arab communities [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1483.52s)]
*  in Michigan. Congresswoman Tlaib is suggesting that she shouldn't be prosecuting these individuals [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1490.56s)]
*  that Nestle says broke the law and that she's only doing it because she. They're going to say she [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1495.44s)]
*  implied it through a statement without providing the full context of the interview and quote. It [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1500.32s)]
*  doesn't matter. There is no area where she even remotely implies it. Like what are we talking [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1503.2s)]
*  about? She's Jewish and the protesters are not. That's quite, quite an accusation. Do you think [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1508.56s)]
*  it's true? Like I said, Jake, I'm not going to get in the middle of this argument that they're having. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1516.72s)]
*  And then there was this exchange with Republican Senator Tom Cotton. Are you comfortable with that [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  with Donald Trump saying if he loses preemptively, it's the fault of the Jews, a group already [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1526.0s)]
*  experiencing a rise in this country from the left and the right, but dog Tom Cotton is like the number [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1530.96s)]
*  one brother of Israel. I can't believe they're about to say he's what the still preemptively. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1535.92s)]
*  It's the fault of the Jews. Well, Jake, Donald Trump has been saying things like this for at [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1541.1200000000001s)]
*  least 11 months since the October 7th attack. I've never heard you say anything like that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1546.24s)]
*  If we lose, it will be the fault of the Jews. But Jake, Donald Trump again has been saying for months [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1550.4s)]
*  that anyone who cares about Israel, anyone who cares about the fate of the US Israel Alliance [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1555.5200000000002s)]
*  should vote for him. I'm talking about Jewish voters who vote for any number of reasons on any [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1560.72s)]
*  number of issues. And he was at Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
*  wait a minute. Well, you just said Zionism is Judaism. You implied it and you have implied it [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1569.28s)]
*  time and time again, you use it cynically as a defense mechanism over and over again. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1575.84s)]
*  I don't really understand. I don't really understand this at all. So if that's the case, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1580.8s)]
*  if that's the truth that you present on a Monday, you have to continue talking about that as though [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1586.32s)]
*  it's truthful on Tuesday. You know what I mean? You can't just like say that all day every day [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1591.4399999999998s)]
*  on CNN and then turn around and be like, can you believe Donald Trump said this? So I guess you [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1597.36s)]
*  must not believe it then because he doesn't. And that's my point. Okay. Because it is an inherently [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1601.6799999999998s)]
*  sentiment to claim that all Jews care about is Israel and that that is the only thing that they [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1607.9199999999998s)]
*  care about. And Israel represents Judaism. That is an sentiment. That is precisely why both Nazis [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1613.36s)]
*  and ultra Zionists represent this sentiment and repeat it on a regular fucking basis. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1619.9199999999998s)]
*  Problem with Jake Tapper is that he wants to turn around and use both sides of that argument [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1625.12s)]
*  cynically. On Monday, he'll say, oh, if you criticize someone, if you call them a Zionist, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1630.7199999999998s)]
*  you're actually you mean Jew and you hate Jews. And Zionism is just simply Israel having a right [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1635.52s)]
*  to exist in the conditions that it currently exists under and that Israel has a right to be a [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1643.2s)]
*  Jewish supremacist ethno state that actually has it and is currently conducting. And if you actually [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1648.8s)]
*  criticize that, that means you hate all Jews. All Jews love this. That's all they think about. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1652.96s)]
*  If you believe that on Monday, you got to believe that on Tuesday. You can't just say that on Monday. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1656.64s)]
*  As a matter of fact, you can't say that in the same day because this is Sunday, not even Monday. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1661.76s)]
*  On Sunday, Jake Tapper literally reiterated this position time and time again. He does it all the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1665.92s)]
*  time. So when Trump says it, what's the problem? All of a sudden it becomes an issue, doesn't it? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1670.8s)]
*  How does that work? When Trump says you Jews need to vote for me, I'm giving you exactly what you [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1676.0s)]
*  want. All you care about is Israel. How is that any different than Jake Tapper also repeating that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1681.9199999999998s)]
*  position all the time as a defensive posture? It's not different at all. Trump does tell it [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1687.12s)]
*  like it is, right? The problem is he also believes in the false notion that all Jews care about is [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1693.04s)]
*  God damn Israel. It's not the truth. But Jake Tapper knows it's not the truth and yet he still [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1698.72s)]
*  continuously deflects and uses this as a cynical shield to be like, no, no, no, you can't criticize [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1704.8s)]
*  Israel. You're because Israel defends all Jews across the world. That's up. That's up, big dog. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1712.64s)]
*  In a minute, talk about combating here and around the world. Just, just yes or no. Are you [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1718.72s)]
*  comfortable with him using that language? Jake, it's the same kind of language he's been using [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1722.96s)]
*  for months. It doesn't mean it's okay, but it's his point, his point. Jake, he's the most pro-Israel [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1726.72s)]
*  president we've ever had. Now Jake asked that question over and over again. Senator Cotton [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1732.32s)]
*  never answered. It's insane that the mainstream media is making Trump's statement an Israel issue. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1736.8s)]
*  I think it's dangerous because it literally incites Trump's base to blame the Jews even harder [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1740.96s)]
*  for some for the election if he loses. This is a Jewish friending and it's wild that the media [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1744.08s)]
*  isn't covering that aspect of Trump's statements more. Well, the problem is the media isn't covering [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1747.1200000000001s)]
*  that aspect of Trump's statements more because the media agrees with Donald Trump. Whether they [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1751.84s)]
*  believe it genuinely or not doesn't change that reality. That's the whole point. They literally [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1755.76s)]
*  also will cynically claim that like Israel represents the interests of all Jews. And if [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1761.68s)]
*  you ever criticize Israel, that means you're actually talking about Jews. And they repeat it [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1767.28s)]
*  over and over and over again, despite the fact that they know it's not correct. Okay, they know [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1771.68s)]
*  it's not correct. Maybe some of like the most deluded ultra Zionists might believe that to be [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1776.72s)]
*  true. But like most people know it's not the case. Most people know that that's not the case. It's [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1782.32s)]
*  just a country. Okay, that's what Israel is. It's a country just like any other country. Just like [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1786.32s)]
*  Saudi Arabia doesn't represent the interests of the entire ummah, the entire Islam, the world of [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1790.56s)]
*  Islam, despite having Mecca right there. Why does nobody ever go, oh, you're criticizing Saudi [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1796.72s)]
*  Arabia. Quite Islamophobic, sweetie. Why does nobody ever say that? Okay, it's literally a [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1802.24s)]
*  theocratic, it's a it's a theocratic kingdom. Like what? What's up? They do though? No, they don't [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1807.52s)]
*  get out of here. You will never ever in a million years hear that from a single goddamn media [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1813.28s)]
*  orbiter in the same severity that you hear that about Israel on a daily fucking base. What are [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1819.68s)]
*  you talking about? Not a single person will ever seriously bring that up. If they did, people will [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1824.48s)]
*  make fun of them nonstop. And they should because it's stupid. That's a stupid thing to say, oh, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1829.6s)]
*  criticizing Saudi Arabia for doing quite Islamophobic, sweetie. That's ridiculous. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1835.84s)]
*  Here is a statement from me back in May 21 2021. Stop conflating Jews all around the world with [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1840.72s)]
*  the horrific Israeli occupation you are being when you claim that all Jews are a monolith in [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1847.12s)]
*  their unconditional support for a far right, ultra nationalist ethno state government engaging in war. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1850.48s)]
*  I've been saying the same damn for years and years and years. Okay, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1857.36s)]
*  consistency. It's called being correct. It's called consistency. It's called having moral [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1861.44s)]
*  courage, something that is sorely lacking from most of our outlets in both mainstream media and [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1866.96s)]
*  even independent media. Now use that argument for Iran. What do you mean? That would be hilarious, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1872.72s)]
*  dude. That would be hilarious. Like, can you imagine people being like John Bolton, sweetie, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1878.56s)]
*  you're being quite Islamophobic. Also, the reason why I use Saudi Arabia and not Iran as an example [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1884.0s)]
*  is because Iran is a foreign adversary. So we do actually do a quite a bit of Islamophobia to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1891.04s)]
*  justify our actions against Iran. Okay, Iranian civilians who take it from both sides in that [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1895.84s)]
*  situation, both from their own theocratic governance and also the goddamn Western world [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1901.6s)]
*  with their crippling sanctions. Anyway, going to Zinded like Mark with the goon debt. You're about [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1906.96s)]
*  to go into goon debt. If you don't subscribe at the top of the hour when there's a three minute [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1911.84s)]

*  I love seeing these like supposed open minded like Joe Rogan orbiters come out and very openly [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1920.08s)]
*  defend Israel. Like every single one of these is like Islam is the greatest evil of all time. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1927.6799999999998s)]
*  All these like IDW frauds coming out and being like, whatever Israel does in Lebanon, or in [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1933.84s)]
*  Palestine, it don't matter. It's all worthy. It is all deserved. Just like you deserve the top [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1940.8799999999999s)]

*  Islamophobia because they can't stand Iran. What? I don't think you understood anything that I [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1951.84s)]
*  said. Anyway, here's the three minute outbreak. Now, this alert just hit wire attributed to a [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1957.4399999999998s)]
*  senior US Department official asked about Israel's strategy against Hezbollah. The official says can't [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1962.0s)]
*  recall in recent memory period which escalation led to deescalation. Oh, wow. This will surely [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1966.1599999999999s)]
*  change the dynamic. No, it won't. Because we're too busy talking about this dumb- [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1971.52s)]
*  Cotton has spoken out when it appears to come from the political left. He actually tweeted, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1975.36s)]
*  there's no place for an America when Jake posted about people harassing yours truly at a book event. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1979.9199999999998s)]
*  CNN's David Chalian is back with me. I was grateful for that. As are as anybody who is the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1987.4399999999998s)]
*  subject and the victim of hate or any other hate and. Yeah, yeah, no, totally Dana. You got [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=1995.4399999999998s)]
*  victimized with the hate like what does this mean? Israel sets off a nuke. Okay. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2004.32s)]
*  You defend the setting off of that nuke. People say you're a bloodless monster for your defense [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2011.1999999999998s)]
*  of setting off that nuke. And then they're the like, what are you? What is this? What is this [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2016.3999999999999s)]
*  argument? Like, oh, you could just like say whatever you want about Israel. But you know, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2020.8s)]
*  if they criticize you, then you know, they're in the wrong there. Got it. Seems good. As 11 [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2026.24s)]
*  needs to keep talking my dad, whether I talk about talk about the gene used to him in Palestine, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2032.56s)]
*  he mentioned the Palestine tried to take over when he was a kid or something. So he has a bias. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2036.96s)]
*  There seems to be defending Israel in the same when it comes to Lebanon. Yeah, his attitude might [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2040.1599999999999s)]
*  unfortunately, his attitude might change. Unfortunately, later down the line, when you're [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2044.08s)]
*  convinced that someone is wrong, when that person refuses to discuss the matter, refuse to provide [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2049.12s)]
*  evidence on the grounds that everyone has the right to think as they please, you can't be [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2052.56s)]
*  tolerant. Freedom of thought does not mean freedom to wander and ramble. First time hearing this was [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2055.52s)]
*  actually a nuke? No, Israel never set off a new king. They set off five nukes worth of munitions [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2059.92s)]
*  in five, not one, five nukes worth of munitions. It wasn't just like one nuke. Okay, but it was [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2065.92s)]
*  such a consistent level of that it was a nuke worth multiple nukes worth of [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2075.6s)]
*  Israel cannot set off a new king because of the fallout, because Israel, because is literally [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2082.64s)]
*  right there. Okay, it would be like nuking Brooklyn from Manhattan. That's the distance, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2088.48s)]
*  but what they can do is use more conventional weapons, rockets of different sorts to, you know, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2095.04s)]
*  use equivalent firepower without the fallout. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2104.16s)]
*  You know, use equivalent firepower without the fallout. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2107.2s)]
*  The key is, which we have learned the hard way, is you've got to call it out no matter where it [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2110.72s)]
*  comes from. What does it tell you about the inability or unwillingness to do so when it comes [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2115.12s)]
*  from a prominent person in your own party? That you change your word. It's not an inability. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2123.12s)]
*  It's unwillingness. And it's because you're putting politics ahead of... [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2126.32s)]
*  It's always too dumb talking to one another going exactly. Okay. Shut the up, dude. What is [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2130.88s)]
*  this circle jerk, dude? Hey guys, I know a ton of awful things are happening in Lebanon, but you [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2136.88s)]
*  know what the real problem is? Something Rashida Tlaib didn't even say that we just made up and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2145.76s)]
*  we are claiming she said, and then we're arguing about how hard she said the thing that she didn't [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2151.12s)]
*  even say. Like, thank you. Thank you for cutting a lot of commentary around this made up thing [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2156.32s)]
*  that you made up instead of covering anything real. That's cool. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2162.0s)]
*  Prentice and morality. And that's what both of them did there. It's not very hard to say that [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2166.56s)]
*  Rashida... [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2173.04s)]
*  It's just funny because like the person who conducted the interview, the journalist, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2173.68s)]
*  okay, the investigative reporter who conducted the interview keeps reiterating that this is a [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2179.04s)]
*  falsehood. Okay. That they are lying about Rashida Tlaib's intention. They are lying about [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2184.8s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib. They are lying about things that she said. They are just making up things that she [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2192.0800000000004s)]
*  said under any other circumstance. Like there would be a mechanism of defense. When CNN did [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2196.88s)]
*  this with Donald Trump, there was at least like a right-wing media circuit that would go crazy over [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2203.52s)]
*  it and disparage CNN. But there's no one for someone like Rashida Tlaib. You got me and you [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2208.96s)]
*  got maybe a handful of journalists. No, she said there's an anti-Palestinian bias among many [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2215.6s)]
*  institutions. That is very different than what you're claiming she implied. Where is your pager, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2219.92s)]
*  says Marinsky Jonas. Will they have to leave to defend herself? No, they'll do incredible. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2223.76s)]
*  They will go to incredible lengths to besmirch her and smear her over and over and over again. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2228.96s)]
*  And for the record, if you are sympathetic to Muslim Americans, if you know any Muslim Americans, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2236.08s)]
*  if you know any Arab Americans, if you know, if you've, if you are Muslim yourself in the Western [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2242.24s)]
*  world, if you're Arab yourself in the Western world, you already know that there's no one that's [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2248.72s)]
*  going to defend her. What are you crazy? This does not happen. Okay. This, what they are doing right [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2252.08s)]
*  now has happened so many times. It happened with Inhan Omar. It happened with Rashida Tlaib. It even [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2258.88s)]
*  happens to me chat. Like, what are we talking about? I'm not a member of Congress. It just [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2264.72s)]
*  does not matter. That's a lot of research tabs. Yes, you're right. I should actually go on Wikipedia [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2268.8799999999997s)]
*  instead to find Steve Neil Nieveling, who wrote the article with Rashida Tlaib responding to a [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2275.12s)]
*  Twitter post. I should just find it on Wikipedia instead. Thank you. You know, I don't know if you [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2280.7999999999997s)]
*  know this, but sometimes journalists still are on Twitter. Okay. And they respond to other commentators [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2285.52s)]
*  who are lying on Twitter to call out that they're lying on Twitter. And there is functionally no way [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2293.6s)]
*  of covering that story without going on Twitter. Thank you for repeating an idiotic statement that [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2299.12s)]
*  you heard from your consistently wrong debate daddy account created in 2012. That was so fast. I know. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2304.56s)]
*  I got him. I was just pretending to be an idiot. I know, dude. I know you got me. You got me so good. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2312.7999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. Everyone is admiring how good you got me. I'm crying. You're so good at pretending to be [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2319.6s)]
*  a moron that you have 35,000 people convinced that you actually are a moron. And to be fair, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2326.32s)]
*  you might be, you know, he's crying. And I can't clip shame. Oh, oh, I'm shaking. I'm going to go [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2334.56s)]
*  back to my Discord and be like, I'm shaking. Speaking of the community that these come from, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2343.6s)]
*  okay. This is the way that they operate. If you want to know, let's take a look. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2349.36s)]
*  Dude, everyone thought that this guy was super cool when he did that. Like everyone. He sounds [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2374.0s)]
*  so nervous. I mean, of course he sounds nervous. Yeah. Yeah. He did this to E-Rob too and then got [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  clapped. Yeah. It's the same guy. It's the Destiny fan, Destiny orbiter, who is like an absolute [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2386.3199999999997s)]
*  dude. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2394.0s)]
*  Too bad. The clip ends before he drowns him. Yeah, dude. Everyone, the clip ends right before every [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2398.56s)]
*  single person that was around him started high-fiving him immediately. They were like, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2403.6s)]
*  dude, you are so sick. There is no difference between this and 4chan incels. Yeah. There is no [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2407.2s)]
*  difference because this is, this is what this community has become. It's all 4chan incels. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2411.84s)]
*  And that is precisely what happens when you put a 4chan incel out in public. Okay. Strap a camera [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2417.84s)]
*  on them. This is how exactly how they operate. The amount of clips I've seen of kickstreamers [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2424.56s)]
*  harassing people at TwitchCon is insane. I feel like the main thing stopping that platform from [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2428.4s)]
*  succeeding are some people on it. One of them asked my 12 year old daughter to go to clubs with [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2431.52s)]
*  her. They are banned now. Pan from life. Jesus Christ. Even the losers were like, yeah, not a [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2435.6800000000003s)]
*  good look. Sire will not like this. What if you're in case you're curious about the brain [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2443.28s)]
*  trust they have over there? I guess this dude has blocked me, which is pretty funny. Hello, little [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2448.1600000000003s)]
*  one. Would you like to join my team? I just don't understand what causes someone to get to this [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2453.6800000000003s)]
*  degree. You know what I mean? What do they get out of this though? Like, why do they put so much [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2460.2400000000002s)]
*  effort into something with no reward? It's, it's a hyper specific type of person. It's, there are a [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2463.92s)]
*  lot of communities like this online. You don't, if you take regular showers, if you take regular [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2471.44s)]
*  showers, you are completely unfamiliar with this stuff. But this is basically like the final stage [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2478.64s)]
*  of behaving like an online troll who normally is like anonymous. There are a lot of people who [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2485.04s)]
*  want someone to act out their desires. A lot of people who never go outside that want at least [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2492.56s)]
*  one person act out those desires. So they'll like, they'll max out at like a thousand to maybe like [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2497.68s)]
*  3000 live concurrent viewers. And usually it just stays at that level. But yeah, this person behaves [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2502.24s)]
*  exactly like an avatar for all of those people who can't really go outside. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjBbkxRrpGU&t=2509.2s)]
