**HasanAbi:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg)
*  Spectrum does do this constantly, I know. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=0.0s)]
*  This seems a little bit different though. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=2.0s)]
*  This seems different than a regular outage. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=4.0s)]
*  Often times when stuff like this happens, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=6.0s)]
*  Spectrum will turn around and be like, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=8.0s)]
*  hey, by the way, my bad. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=10.0s)]
*  Massive outage in your area. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=12.0s)]
*  Like they'll, they'll [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=16.0s)]
*  famously, they'll routinely turn around [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=18.0s)]
*  and be like, hey, by the way, sorry about this, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=20.0s)]
*  but, um, you're experiencing a ginormous outage in your area. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=22.0s)]
*  Alright, we're back. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=31.0s)]
*  Can you see me? Can you hear me? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=34.0s)]
*  Uh, hopefully, hopefully you can hear me and see me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=36.0s)]
*  Uh, I'm back now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=40.0s)]
*  Um, that is a major F [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=42.0s)]
*  that just took place. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=44.0s)]
*  A major, major F. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=46.0s)]
*  And it took place because [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=48.0s)]
*  the internet is completely out of my house. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=50.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened. I think Betar came after me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=52.0s)]
*  And, uh, hold on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=56.0s)]
*  Can you see? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=58.0s)]
*  Can you see me? I think you can see me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=60.0s)]
*  Okay, you can see me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=62.0s)]
*  Do I look, uh, fine? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=64.0s)]
*  I think I look fine. Alright. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=66.0s)]
*  Luckily my, uh, trusty [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=68.0s)]
*  sidekick, uh, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=70.0s)]
*  PC was here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=72.0s)]
*  No internet connection right now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=74.0s)]
*  Murat, did you restart it? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=76.0s)]
*  No. Wait, what came back? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=78.0s)]
*  It kind of came back for a second, but [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=80.0s)]
*  it was on the internet for almost a while. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=82.0s)]
*  Okay. Who knows? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=84.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm getting DDoS'd or something. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=86.0s)]
*  Not that this will be a problem. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=88.0s)]
*  Not that this is gonna be a problem [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=90.0s)]
*  in the upcoming week. Would you know quality's great? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=92.0s)]
*  My quality's decent, but not as good as your usual. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=94.0s)]
*  No noise gate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=96.0s)]
*  It's like we're there. Flirt. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=98.0s)]
*  The DNC took me out. Why don't you get FiberDude? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=100.0s)]
*  Hezbollah has it. Why don't you? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=102.0s)]
*  Yeah. If only. If only. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=104.0s)]
*  If only I could do that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=106.0s)]
*  Wait, so you reset it and it started [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=108.0s)]
*  again, but then it went away again? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=110.0s)]
*  No, I didn't do anything. I thought it came back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=112.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=114.0s)]
*  Is there any other thing you can do? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=116.0s)]
*  Like hit a hard reset or something? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=118.0s)]
*  What? Okay, Murat's gonna fix it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=120.0s)]
*  This isn't the laptop chat. This is the remote. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, this is the IRL camera. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=124.0s)]
*  This is the IRL setup [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=126.0s)]
*  that I have. You should get a backup [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=128.0s)]
*  ISP. Yeah, I know. I think we have [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=130.0s)]
*  something in the works for that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=132.0s)]
*  But, um, I also have to pee. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=134.0s)]
*  And I don't want to leave. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=136.0s)]
*  But I can't take you guys with me [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=138.0s)]
*  to the bathroom. So [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=140.0s)]
*  don't know what to do here. Anyway, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=142.0s)]
*  we're back for the time being. What was I talking [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=144.0s)]
*  about? Give the other guy the phone? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=146.0s)]
*  No, Murat is, uh, Murat [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=148.0s)]
*  is working on the internet. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=150.0s)]
*  Because he's here right now as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=152.0s)]
*  So this is one of the few instances [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=154.0s)]
*  where I can get him to actually [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=156.0s)]
*  do some goddamn work in the house. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=158.0s)]
*  Because it's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=160.0s)]
*  in his best interest as well. He lost his [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=162.0s)]
*  own internet as well. So for once, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=164.0s)]
*  he's doing the dang thing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=166.0s)]
*  And actually working. Is this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=168.0s)]
*  a Daily Spectrum thing? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=170.0s)]
*  Like, uh, again, a few years ago, you were [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=172.0s)]
*  talking about how the Dems are saying that they want to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=174.0s)]
*  uh, oh, ruin the party image. I know. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=176.0s)]
*  There is no party image to ruin. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=178.0s)]
*  There is no, the Democrats are complaining [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=180.0s)]
*  that Zoran's far [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=182.0s)]
*  left, Zoran's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=184.0s)]
*  far left image, if he [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=186.0s)]
*  were to win the New York City mayoral primary, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=188.0s)]
*  would ruin [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=190.0s)]
*  the, the Democratic [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=192.0s)]
*  party. Like the image the Democratic [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=194.0s)]
*  party has created. And [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=196.0s)]
*  I think that that is the dumbest possible thing you can [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=198.0s)]
*  say. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=200.0s)]
*  Considering that the Democratic party's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=202.0s)]
*  approval rating is at like, what, 20%. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=204.0s)]
*  Spectrum does do this constantly. I know. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=206.0s)]
*  This seems a little bit [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=208.0s)]
*  different though. This seems different than a regular outage. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=210.0s)]
*  Uh, often times when stuff like this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=212.0s)]
*  happens, Spectrum will turn around [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=214.0s)]
*  and be like, hey, by the way, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=216.0s)]
*  my bad. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=218.0s)]
*  Massive outage in your area. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=220.0s)]
*  Like, they'll, they'll [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=222.0s)]
*  famously, they'll routinely [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=224.0s)]
*  turn around and be like, hey, by the way, sorry [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=226.0s)]
*  about this, but, um, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=228.0s)]
*  you're experiencing a ginormous outage [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=230.0s)]
*  in your area. It is what it is. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=232.0s)]
*  You know? I can't also do one [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=234.0s)]
*  other thing, which is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=236.0s)]
*  to potentially use the, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=238.0s)]
*  use the, the bag [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=240.0s)]
*  that I have for pure [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=242.0s)]
*  internet. Open up the World of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=244.0s)]
*  Workout Collectors box? No. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=246.0s)]
*  Someone in Long Beach, California [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=248.0s)]
*  was cutting internet lines. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=250.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not contained in LA County. Wait, what? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=252.0s)]
*  No. I do not have fiber in LA? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=254.0s)]
*  What the f- I don't have fiber because [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=256.0s)]
*  my neighborhood doesn't have fiber. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=258.0s)]
*  In Los Angeles, there are plenty of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=260.0s)]
*  places where you literally don't have fiber. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=262.0s)]
*  Cuomo has a 15 year old girl standing outside [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=264.0s)]
*  paying her $25 an hour handing out flyers [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=266.0s)]
*  for Cuomo. Tell her to do a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=268.0s)]
*  bad job. Tell her to do a bad job. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=270.0s)]
*  In LA, there are buildings that don't even have cable [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=272.0s)]
*  internet. This is why I'm saying I'll move [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=274.0s)]
*  to New York if Zoran [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=276.0s)]
*  wins. Maybe for a little [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=278.0s)]
*  bit. Is it illegal [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=280.0s)]
*  if someone is getting paid [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=282.0s)]
*  by the Cuomo campaign and they [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=284.0s)]
*  turn around and actually [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=286.0s)]
*  despite being paid for by the Cuomo [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=290.0s)]
*  campaign if they turn around and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=292.0s)]
*  advocate for Zoran Mamdani? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=294.0s)]
*  Is that illegal? I have fiber [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=296.0s)]
*  in a village that's gonna dump nowhere. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=298.0s)]
*  Brother in Montreal, I'm installing 3 [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=300.0s)]
*  gigs next week. I can install [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=302.0s)]
*  8 gigs in my new house. You need to move to Quebec? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah, let me move from one incredibly [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=306.0s)]
*  expensive housing market to another one. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=308.0s)]
*  At least they have fiber. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=310.0s)]
*  That's what happens in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0aFnonPLg&t=312.0s)]
