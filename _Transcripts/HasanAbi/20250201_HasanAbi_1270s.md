# The Secret Behind The Released Hostages | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8)
*  campaigns to maintain some semblance of humanity in their treatment of the hostages. I mean, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=0.0s)]
*  there's no, there's no comparison. It's not, but by the way, you say propaganda. Okay. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=5.84s)]
*  Does Israel not have the opportunity to do propaganda? Like what are we talking about [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=11.52s)]
*  here? So much of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, if you want to call it that can be solved [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=15.92s)]
*  by Israel behavior. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=22.92s)]
*  All right, let's get to American hostage and two others released. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=25.92s)]
*  Hamas releasing Israeli American hostage, Keith Siegel and two other hot teen months [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=32.2s)]
*  in captivity. ABC's foreign correspondent, Britt. Clint is following all the developments [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=37.84s)]
*  from Tel Aviv. Britt. Good morning. Good morning. Yeah. I'm at the hospital, which will soon [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=42.32s)]
*  receive Keith Siegel. He's expected to stay here for at least four days. Keith becoming [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  the first American Israeli to be freed in this ceasefire. This morning, American Israeli [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=53.56s)]
*  hostage, Keith Siegel finally back on home soil after 15 months in captivity. 65 year [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=59.96s)]
*  old Siegel, the first American to be freed in the breakthrough ceasefire and hostage [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=66.04s)]
*  deal in the ruins of the port in Gaza city. Siegel seen on a stage flanked by mast and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=69.80000000000001s)]
*  armed Hamas forces. Hamas staging an orderly handover after criticism of their handling [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=75.34s)]
*  of Thursday's hostage. Really? It's so crazy. Cause like Hamas will do a handover in inside [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=81.32s)]
*  of a, you know, Hamas will do a hostage handover in prison or swap, whatever. Right. And when [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=86.36s)]
*  they do that in public, there's like massive crowds. Then Israel freaks out about it and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  says, look at these animals. Then they turn around and do it on a podium. Right. Then [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  they'll do a podium hostage release with the gift bag in tow. Then they freak out again [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=103.52s)]
*  because now they're like, Oh, look at how civilized they are. This is unacceptable. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=110.16s)]
*  This is actually ruining our propaganda. Okay. Like the worst thing that Hamas did in the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  eyes of Israel was do the first round of Israeli prisoners of war, the, the female soldiers, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=119.92s)]
*  and they were all thrown up the peace sign. They were smiling. That was devastating for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=126.72s)]
*  a propaganda purposes. That was devastating for Israeli propaganda purposes. So they freaked [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=132.12s)]
*  the out on it. Okay. And said, and then stop the hostage swap process by the way. Okay. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=137.8s)]
*  They stopped it because they hated the visuals of like having, having Israeli hostages, like [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  speaking Arabic and, and, you know, talking about like inshallah the war will end whatever. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=151.68s)]
*  And so they went back to the crowds and then the crowds were, you know, obviously chaotic [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  and then they went back to talking about how they were. And now we're back to the stage [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=165.72s)]
*  releases is crazy. They're giving Hamas is still, I see giving all the hostages, the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  drug that makes you dab them up. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  Please support is watching in Tel Aviv. She is here as American Israeli. Keith Siegel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  is handed over to the Red Cross on October 7th. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, whether it's chaotic or not. Okay. Hamas hostage releases look noticeably different [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=184.84s)]
*  than the Israeli hostage releases that take place. Israeli hostages, the Palestinian hostages [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=191.6s)]
*  in Israeli military prisons come out with a litany of diseases, looking disheveled, looking [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=197.16s)]
*  like they've been starved, handcuffed above their heads. Okay. Perp walked all the way [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=204.72s)]
*  through. Very, very different, very different coverage. If there's any coverage at all in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=210.64s)]
*  American media, no coverage whatsoever. And also, and yeah, also goes to show what, like [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=216.96s)]
*  who actually cares to even maintain the presence that they are at least to a certain degree, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=225.88s)]
*  trying to maintain standards of warfare. Okay. Palestinian prisoners are being released with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  signs of torture and starvation on their bodies. But sure, let's see more headlines about the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=240.44s)]
*  chaotic crowds around freed Israeli prisoner in Gaza. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=243.32s)]
*  Like that hasn't been covered enough. Hamas releases three Israeli hostages in chaotic [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  Gaza, handover, chaotic scenes of Gaza hostage release. Israel releases Palestinian prisoners [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=248.92s)]
*  after delay over chaotic hostage hands, handover. Yeah. Israel delayed the Palestinian release. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=253.04s)]
*  Initially they delayed it because of the non-chaotic hostage release that took place. And then [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=259.2s)]
*  Hamas went back to doing the crowd releases and then that was chaotic. And then they complained [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  about that as well. And then they went back to the stage release. It's crazy. Red Cross [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=268.08s)]
*  workers express outrage. Of course, the only place that like adequately covers this is [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=273.76s)]
*  still Israeli press, by the way, red cross workers express outrages. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=278.44s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners being released as a part of Israel, Hamas ceasefire deal are led [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=282.12s)]
*  with handcuffs above their heads. Yeah. I mean, this is, this is the noticeable difference [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=284.96s)]
*  in treatment when you get held in an Israeli prison facility. This is what you look like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=291.64s)]
*  when you come out, even if you come out at all. Okay. And despite the gruesome conditions [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=296.76s)]
*  of withstanding a genocide Hamas Islamic Jihad and the Palestinian forces across the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=302.12s)]
*  board have tried to do their very best in spite of all of the, you know, relentless [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=307.68s)]
*  bombing campaigns to maintain some semblance of humanity in their treatment of the hostages. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=315.32s)]
*  I mean, there's no, there's no comparison. It's not, by the way you say propaganda. Okay. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=321.4s)]
*  opportunity to do propaganda. Like, what are we talking about here? So much of the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=328.5s)]
*  conflict, if you want to call it that can be solved by Israel behaving like a normal [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=335.38s)]
*  country and not like a monstrous force of apartheid and ethno religious supremacy doing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=341.02s)]
*  a, that's it. That's literally it. Do you not understand? Like Israel will be like, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=351.12s)]
*  Oh, Palestinians are dying in a telegenic fashion. Okay. Palestinians dying looks good [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=358.04s)]
*  for the Hamas cause it's like, bro, they're not perishing. They're not engaging in mass [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=366.2s)]
*  suicide. They're not dying because of car accidents. You're killing them. If you are [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  only thing you care about, if you cannot see the humanity of these people that you're killing [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  and the only thing you care about is the optics of it. They're here. I have a very good solution [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=382.16s)]
*  for it. It's called don't fucking kill these people. It's called, don't do war crimes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  It's called, don't do a genocide. You can't just like do a genocide and then also get [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=392.04s)]
*  mad that people are receiving that in a negative fashion. It doesn't make any sense. This is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=396.54s)]
*  the, this is the problem. Yeah. Even if the Palestinian groups and I've maintained this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  position since October seven, even at the Palestinian groups are only treating hostages [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=406.04s)]
*  better because they're more valuable alive. The outcome is still the same. You're absolutely [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  correct. Chatter. They're treated better in that process. Okay. Having said that, having [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=413.36s)]
*  said that, is there a likelihood that there is like abuse or sexual assaults that have [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=419.6s)]
*  happened under any kind of a Palestinian, like hostage keeping process? Certainly there [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=423.88s)]
*  are criminal elements involved in penetrating the Gaza, the Gaza envelope and going into [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=432.94s)]
*  Israel proper. There were definitely criminal elements that took advantage of the situation. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=438.06s)]
*  Okay. But all the reports on the matter show, and I've straight up, I've, I've read so many [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=444.5s)]
*  of these. Okay. I've read so many reports, both in Western media and in Israeli media [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=451.42s)]
*  from firsthand accounts of hostages that have been released and virtually all of them. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=457.22s)]
*  Okay. With some exceptions, there's like one or two exceptions. Virtually all of them [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=461.9s)]
*  have reported that the Palestinian forces tried to keep them alive to the best of their [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=467.82s)]
*  ability because it makes sense. It's their one leverage. It's their one bargaining chip. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=473.85999999999996s)]
*  You know, genuine question on trolling of Gaza was experiencing a famine and the hostages [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=480.46s)]
*  don't appear to be starving. Would that indicate the hostages care was being prioritized? Obviously [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=484.17999999999995s)]
*  access. Sorry. I know I'm spamming. There are parts of Gaza that is experiencing famine, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=488.62s)]
*  specifically North Gaza. As far as I understand, given the complex tunnel network that exists [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=492.66s)]
*  under the Gaza strip, the likelihood is most likely the likelihood is that they probably [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=498.34000000000003s)]
*  move the hostages around the areas where they had easier access to food. They probably have [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=504.8s)]
*  more food supply. And yes, they were most likely prioritized as well. Can you blame [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=508.74s)]
*  some Israelis agreeing with what is going on? I feel like if you're brainwashed by your [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=513.32s)]
*  parents your whole life, then I would feel like it would be hard to think differently. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=517.64s)]
*  No, I totally understand that. That's why I do what I do chatter. That's my point. That's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=520.8s)]
*  why I have so many Israelis in this chat that consistently rely on my coverage of what the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=526.24s)]
*  is going on. Okay. Yes. Of course I understand social conditioning. My entire job, my entire [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=533.08s)]
*  purpose in this regard is to try to actively tackle that false framing and try to get people [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=540.88s)]
*  to acknowledge the truth. Try to get people to, at the very least understand what motivates [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=548.36s)]
*  people. Do you see what I'm saying? Because a big part of this process, a big part of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=555.4s)]
*  the reception, a big part of understanding like, or, or looking at the situation in Gaza [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=560.8s)]
*  and turning a blind eye to the atrocities or at least championing it, cheering it on [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=568.56s)]
*  stems from the active dehumanization of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims in particular, both in [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  Israel and also outside of Israel in the Western world. Okay. When you, when, when that kind [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=580.56s)]
*  of propaganda has already set in, when you already treat these people as like a barrack [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  force that is not human, that's subhuman, right? Then yeah, you will believe any number [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=593.04s)]
*  of different, any number of different lies that people tell. You will never be able to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=600.52s)]
*  comprehend that. Yes. If you push people into a corner, if you back them into a corner with [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  no way out, they're inevitably going to try and fight out of it. Okay. That's it. Many [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=610.92s)]
*  Americans have been propagandized in a similar way. Right. Do you promote terrorism? No, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=616.12s)]
*  I do not promote terrorism. I do not support the American empire. And I certainly do not [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=622.2s)]
*  support the actions of the Israeli occupying force. So no, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=627.4000000000001s)]
*  Segal was taken from his home alongside his wife Aviva. She was released during the weeklong [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire in November of 2023. Finally, this morning, the end of a long and agonizing wait, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=636.12s)]
*  Aviva and their son Shay watching from a TV at Riem base as Keith was handed over by Hamas. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=643.96s)]
*  He told me last September how she's been dreaming at this moment. And I would just [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=650.2s)]
*  can imagine Keith coming at me, just screaming and jumping on him. And I'll be just the happiest [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=654.48s)]
*  person in the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=661.72s)]
*  like this level of coverage is perfectly valid. Okay. Content. Yeah. This guy is insane. I [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=662.48s)]
*  don't know what the fuck he's talking about. This kind of coverage is perfectly valid. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=667.72s)]
*  I however do wish that they would feature similar humanizing pieces on the Palestinian [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=673.36s)]
*  side as well. But the problem is, I think if you were to, if you were to engage in any [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  sort of humanization of the Palestinian side, people would recognize the horrible conditions [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=688.2800000000001s)]
*  they were put through in the Israeli prison structure. They would also recognize that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=694.96s)]
*  these people are not actually prisoners. Okay. They didn't go through like the legal system. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=699.86s)]
*  They're under permanent detention in military facilities after undergoing a military tribunal. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=704.58s)]
*  So they're actually also hostages. It's just hostages with like maybe a little bit more [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=711.6s)]
*  paperwork than what Hamas has. That's the difference though, because it's a foreign [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=716.62s)]
*  ally that it's a foreign ally that, that, you know, as some semblance of, of, of, of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=721.22s)]
*  the state, the state machine enforcing its will, then it's seen as a totally different. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=730.22s)]
*  What do you mean? Keep the hostages alive to the best of their ability when they're [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=735.1800000000001s)]
*  the ones initiated this thing. What do you think? Why do you think people take hostages? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=737.5s)]
*  Do you think people take hostages to just simply kidnap and kill them? Because that's [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=742.1800000000001s)]
*  a different thing. That's not hostage taking. That's just murder, right? Like this isn't, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=746.54s)]
*  this isn't me reinventing reinventing the wheel. Okay. What was October 7? What do you [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=754.3399999999999s)]
*  mean? What was October 7? I'm confused by your line of questioning here. Okay. Damage [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=759.62s)]
*  control going crazy. Yes. Damage control, which is me reinstating the exact same commentary [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=766.62s)]
*  that I have engaged in since why they have to take hostages to begin with. Oh, great [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=777.0999999999999s)]
*  question. 76 years of military occupation by a settler colonial state that has been [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=782.42s)]
*  unimaginably violent to the indigenous, indigenous Palestinian population from its inception [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=789.42s)]
*  in 1948 with the mass expulsion and ethnic transfer of 750,000 Palestinians followed [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=795.42s)]
*  up by 76. Okay. Tucker, what he's you asked me a question. I'm giving you like a super, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=803.38s)]
*  super brief history of, of the Israeli state and how it works. I don't know what okay. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=810.86s)]
*  Tucker means. Are you saying I'm Tucker Carlson or something from chatter in the West bank [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=816.86s)]
*  measures? My family lives in between your West bank. We're passing a hostages are released. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=820.42s)]
*  I know that the IDF have been firing at crowds that release hostages. Here's further proof. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=824.62s)]
*  I don't understand the mindset that people have when they come in here and ask a question, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=828.46s)]
*  I think in bad faith specifically to just go, yeah, I can't hear you. La la la la. Fuck [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=832.46s)]
*  peace. Like what, what goes through your mind in that process where you're like, I actually [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=839.62s)]
*  don't want to hear. I actually don't want to hear the real reasons anyway. Yeah. 76 [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=845.38s)]
*  years of permanent occupation, apartheid, mass separation, humiliation, almost a century [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=851.6600000000001s)]
*  of domination with no way out a so-called peace process that yielded no positive results [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=858.94s)]
*  for the Palestinians. Teaching the Palestinians a very important lesson, a very, very dangerous [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=866.94s)]
*  lesson as a matter of fact, that trying to negotiate through diplomacy with the sovereign [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=872.94s)]
*  Israeli settler colonial state is only going to lead to further encroachment on existing [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=877.94s)]
*  Palestinian land in the West bank specifically with settlement operations expanding throughout [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=883.94s)]
*  the so-called peace process. Okay. Creating bantastans in the West bank and restricting [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=889.94s)]
*  freedom of travel. You said it best when you watched that Willie Mack video, your officer [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=900.2600000000001s)]
*  too stupid to even understand what words you use. Yeah. Tucker argued with peers about [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=904.32s)]
*  the Gaza situation. He might've been referring to that. Yeah. Yeah. Tucker Carlson is, is [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=908.1s)]
*  now woke. So stupid. I hate that the, I hate that it's always the likes of Tucker Carlson, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=914.38s)]
*  who was a very good propagandist that gets all of this hype. The big takeaway here is [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=922.02s)]
*  that these, these people would probably be more charitable if you look more Western European, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=927.42s)]
*  but you look more Middle Eastern. Therefore you're showing the other side of the story [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=931.1s)]
*  makes you a terrorist. Yeah. I think, I mean, look, Muslim related Arab related matters [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=933.38s)]
*  is the one instance where, is, is truly the one instance where like people are not receptive [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=939.3s)]
*  to what I have to say. And I think part of that is because despite the fact that I look [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=945.88s)]
*  white and I am white, there's still, I think a hangup that many people have when your name [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=950.12s)]
*  is a son and you're fucking Turkish. Okay. World and Keith from the minute he comes [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=955.9s)]
*  home, he's going to be the king. He's going to be the king of the world. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=964.42s)]
*  Now that day has finally come. Hamas also really what's up with his narcissistic dude [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=968.1s)]
*  thinking he's a debate. God, are you talking about me? Cause I don't think that I very [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=972.9s)]
*  openly state that I'm not very good at debate. I am fairly knowledgeable on, on certain issues, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=977.38s)]
*  though. I would say this is one of them releasing two other hostages this morning, a separate [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=984.7s)]
*  event in the city of Han units, bringing off a Calderon and yard and be bus to a stage [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=990.5400000000001s)]
*  before handing them over to the red cross. The two have now safely returned to Israel. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=995.58s)]
*  Many have followed the story of the Bibas family since the October 7th attacks yard [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1000.3s)]
*  and Bibas is the father of the two youngest children abducted by Hamas. Bebass seen kidnapped [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1004.3s)]
*  in this video, his wife, Shiri clutching their nine month old and four year old as they were [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1008.9s)]
*  taken. Their fate is unknown. Still one more American expected to be among the 33 hostages [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1013.66s)]
*  released in phase. Why are there so many pro genocide chatters today? Why do you think [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1019.14s)]
*  man, why do you think perhaps it has something to do with my former podcast co-host who literally [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1023.22s)]
*  ended the podcast over our difference in opinion on Israel making finalizing his like six month [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1029.46s)]
*  project by calling me an anti-Semitic terrorist. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1037.06s)]
*  Maybe those people watch that and came in here and were like, yeah, I can't wait to show [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1042.5s)]
*  them what's what. Yeah. I mean, it's just a brigading, which because you can't be serious. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1047.42s)]
*  Ethan cleared you debate. Ethan, I would love to do that. I mean, I would love to have a [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1054.42s)]
*  conversation with Ethan. It doesn't have to be a debate, but if it is, then it is. But [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1057.5s)]
*  yeah, if you, I mean, I, I feel like if you genuinely think that he will best me in the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1063.5s)]
*  marketplace of ideas when, you know, only a couple months ago he was like, Oh, I didn't [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1069.66s)]
*  know enough about your of Golan, the fucking defense minister of Israel, who is, you know, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1075.02s)]
*  a war criminal after saying he was a good guy. I feel like he's not the best equipped [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1079.58s)]
*  to have this conversation in a way that will, you know, yield results that you think are [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1086.9s)]
*  good. Yeah. Or not knowing what Roe v. Wade is either. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1094.54s)]
*  On this deal, Sagi Dehkir Khan in exchange for this morning's three hostages, 183 Palestinian [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1100.54s)]
*  prisoners also freed from Israeli jails. The ceasefire also allowing for crucial medical [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1107.06s)]
*  evacuations in Gaza for the first time in more than eight months. The rough crossing [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1111.94s)]
*  reopening to allow sick and wounded Palestinians to get treatment abroad and in the North displaced [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1116.34s)]
*  Gazans finally making their way back to what is left of their homes. The UN saying nearly [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1121.5s)]
*  half a million people have returned to northern Gaza since the crossing reopened in the past [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1125.98s)]
*  week. The Segal family releasing a statement saying they are filled with indescribable [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1130.18s)]
*  excitement thanking president Trump saying our hope lies with you that the others are [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1137.42s)]
*  returned home. Janai Aviva and Keith will be back together with their son again. Thank [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1141.74s)]
*  you so much for that, Brit. These happy moments were decades in the making. Now being a time [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1147.54s)]
*  being interrupted, embarrassing watching you hide from Ethan's vids. I don't think I can [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1155.98s)]
*  be your fan anymore. Once again, I'm not hiding. I have maintained this position. I will repeat [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1159.14s)]
*  it again for you. I am willing and able to talk to Ethan directly. I feel like that would [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1165.98s)]
*  probably be more, more of a productive conversation. Don't you think, Hey, haven't seen the Ethan [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1172.74s)]
*  vid. What does he say? Should I watch the Ethan vid? Hey Hasan, I edited the content [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1180.02s)]
*  for you. Embarrassing watching you hide from Ethan. What is happening? The chatters today. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1183.8s)]
*  Okay. What is happening? I think, yeah, I think chatters are just baiting the same thing [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1189.04s)]
*  over and over again to like loop me back into the conversation. No chat still 2023. Yeah. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1194.12s)]
*  No, I don't think that's a drama baiter. I think that's October 7th leader. Instead of [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1200.0s)]
*  watching another one hour and 40 minutes. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1205.24s)]
*  Slop with, you know, clips that are completely out of context. I would love to have a normal [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1209.24s)]
*  conversation, a polite conversation with my former podcast cohost to be way too charitable [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1217.28s)]
*  to someone who's definitely being disingenuous. They might see you as having better debate [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1222.92s)]
*  tactics. So even though you're wrong in their eyes, you will be using debate tricks. Oh, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1225.48s)]
*  yeah. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1231.68s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1232.68s)]
*  Anyway, what else was I going to talk about? Cause we only have 10 minutes remaining before [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1233.68s)]
*  I do Geo guesser. And I also [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Qt1MAvzf8&t=1261.66s)]
