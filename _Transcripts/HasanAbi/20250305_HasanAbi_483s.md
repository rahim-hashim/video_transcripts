**HasanAbi:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o)
*  It's Kaya's second B day. Please tell me you perform well. My dad watched the pod. I really want to show him. Yeah, I think so. I think you guys will. I think you guys will will like it. It's like those podcasts are really good because those podcasts are really good because you can show it to your friends and family. You know what I mean? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=0.0s)]
*  Get Kaya get in here. Lady place from rainy California, Los Angeles folks were live and alive and I hope all the boys girls and emby's are having a fantastic moment because today is a beautiful day. Today's a wonderful day. The day is Kaya's birthday. Ladies and gentlemen. That's right. We got the birthday girl in the building looking angelic. And this is the part of the broadcast where I will tell you about my personal news. I hope all the boys, girls and emby's are having a fantastic [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=20.0s)]
*  one because today's a beautiful day. Regardless of the rain. It is. It is fricking March. Oh, there's Phil's birthday man. Emo. So let me let me restart that. Yeah, she's two years old now. Guys turn two years old. It's March 5th 2025. And [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=50.0s)]
*  Kaya is officially a little lady. She's officially no longer a puppy at the age of two. She is officially moved on from being a pupper. You being a little lady. That's right. And as far as personal news goes, I have a lot to tell you in between the time period where I press the stop streaming button and press the star streaming button. A lot has happened. Okay. A lot has happened. And I'm going to get to all of that in a brief moment. What an incredible work of art. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=70.28s)]
*  Now this chatter has made you got her gums perfectly. Okay. The the weight of it. I can feel it from this hyper realistic artwork. As you guys know, I am the number one apolitical podcast, the number one apolitical content creator in general. As you know, don't make me put the hat on, but I can if you want me to just so people understand how apolitical I am. Non-political actor Hassan Hassanabi piker in the building. What did non-political actor Hassanabi piker do last night? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=100.28s)]
*  Well, let me tell you, okay. I didn't do much. I just ended the broadcast after 10 hours. Another half of laziness. You already know what it is, right? Basically did my did my freaking half day played some kingdom come deliverance. And and that's it. I went to bed woke up early and in the midst of all this rain and all this madness here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=130.28s)]
*  In California, I took my ass out to Theo Vons podcast and I did Theo Vons pod. That's right. I'm sure that this will be very controversial for everyone involved, but I think it's pretty good. I thought it was a great opportunity. A great platform shouts out the Theo for giving me said opportunity. Also, Kaia met her. I met him as well. How was a political podcast? It was very apolitical. It was very, very apolitical. I'm very [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=160.28s)]
*  excited to see. I'm very excited to see what happens. But yeah, that's the reason why I'm late and I apologize. Was Theo chill? Yeah, he's chill as hell. Joe Roe next. I don't think that Joe Roe will have him but anytime soon because I do think that like Theo Von is interested in interviewing people from all different walks of life and and you know, Gabor Mate, you know, and Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=190.28s)]
*  But then he's also, you know, someone said he interviewed clandestine. I did not know that he interviewed clandestine. That's crazy. That is actually crazy. All right. Well, how hard did he make you laugh? It was, it was more serious than it was funny. I tried. I tried to do some, I tried to do some memes, you know, get ready for the most brigadier comment section of all time. It's going to be crazy. Yeah. It just dropped 44 minutes ago. Oh my God. All right. Well, in any case, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=220.28s)]
*  anti semis of the year contestants assembled on the pod. Yeah, exactly. Theo is collecting them. Did he have political questions for you? Yes, we talked a lot about politics. In any case, in any case. Did you own the libs? No, I don't think so. But that's it. There's not really much else going on in terms of personal news in my life. If we're being really really if we're being really real. And yeah, I'm I'm just working a lot. You guys already [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=250.28s)]
*  know. And I love it because I love I just I love I love keeping busy. It's Kaia second B day. Please tell me you perform well. My dad watched the pod. I really want to show him. Yeah, I think so. I think you guys will. I think you guys will will like it. It's like those podcasts are really good because those podcasts are really good because you can show it to your friends and family. You know what I mean? Get them to listen to it. Because when I don't have when I don't have [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=280.28s)]
*  like crazy when I don't have people in my ear constantly yelling at me. I think I perform a lot better. All right. We're going to be talking about Trump tariffs. Whack joint session hearing Whack joint session speech and and more. Adams is getting roasted by all sides of Congress. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=310.28s)]
*  Eric Adams or who we need more standalone and podcast content from you. I think that hurts your message and brain chatter brain dead chatters breaking up your point. I had not met Theo Vaughn until this podcast. I didn't even know why he I don't know why he reached like he reached out to my management to have me on and I was shocked. And I of course said yes absolutely. Why wouldn't I. You know what I mean. The vibe check I'm getting from conservatives fears that you have many problems. If you have any problems with Trump's speech last night whatsoever it means you hate kids with cancer. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=335.28s)]
*  Meanwhile like you said is Trump who's basically mim maxing childhood cancer rates. Yeah I think conservative propaganda has basically gotten worse and worse year over year where they're they're becoming hysterical in the dumbest ways possible. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=365.28s)]
*  We're here by the way we're blasting off. Here it is. Basically they just they're not only are they soy right like they're full blown soy right. OK we need a dark oak to combat the soy right. But also simultaneously they are they're just so like they're so lame like their their propaganda is so bad. If you didn't stand up and applaud this young cancer survivor and is amazing there's really something sick and messed up about you. It's like yeah dude sorry. I I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=380.8s)]
*  I'm I didn't you know salute the flag when the administration is propping up a kid with a child with brain cancer while simultaneously cutting cancer research funds and also cutting the the regulatory agencies that are supposed to protect additional future [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=410.8s)]
*  generations from you know eating all of these toxic pollutants and toxic chemicals like it's so dumb. Dems are finally fighting back for real this time. Is this the cringe. Oh no stop. Dude liberals love this stuff. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=426.68s)]
*  I I don't want to I don't want to yell at them. I don't want to even like clown on it and then have people be like Hassan you're racist. You're doing misogynoir. Like I just I don't know. I don't know what to say about it. I great. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=440.52000000000004s)]
*  Also you telling them to just shut the fuck up makes them feel like winners. I don't think so. Like even I know you're not political. What do you mean dog. I'm the most ap- hold on hold on hold on. Let me put my apolitical cat back on. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=455.16s)]
*  How dare you. How dare you. It's just common sense. All I'm doing is common sense. All I'm saying and doing is common sense baby. Common sense is not so common. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s55LF0d3o&t=466.56s)]
