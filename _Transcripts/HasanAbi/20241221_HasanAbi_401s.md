# Brianna Wu Is Furious With JK Rowling | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE)
*  I think I do know why Briana Wu doesn't get it because she's just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=0.0s)]
*  f**king s**t bit like that's it. Okay, that's it. She's just f**king [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=3.04s)]
*  So she I don't think she understands this even as a trans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  person that like a transphobic person did not logically arrive [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=12.48s)]
*  at the conclusion of transphobe. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=17.28s)]
*  Before we do that, it seems like Briana Wu was trying to get jk [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=23.8s)]
*  Never forget gender identity isn't about sex stereotypes of playing around with your hair proves you're not a man. Briana Wu, I know that there's an angry crowd that will never believe trans women are an admittedly weird variation of woman. But for people in the middle, here's 25 minutes of doll cat show just talking about doing our hair. Can anyone honestly say we would make sense living as men? jk Rowling saw that and got very mad about it and said never forget gender identity isn't about sex stereotypes. But playing around with your hair proves you're not a man. Briana Wu [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=29.2s)]
*  responded to her with this long ass effort post. Miss Rowling First of all, our show is about moderate trans positions. If you watched it, you probably agree with many of our positions. We don't support trans women in sports. We have severe reservations about trans the trans fringe. We don't like the way it's medicalizing children, particularly young girls. And that's considering two of our hosts transitioned as minors. This clip about four trans women having the kinds of conversations most women have. We're trying to get people like you to see our humanity. None of us will be happy if you forced us to live as men. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=58.48s)]
*  There's a political project pushing everyone to the extremes right now. I've taken a lot of heat denouncing the trans fringe, the same people that have sent you death threats. Neither of us have to be a part of it. We really can find solutions that work for everyone you are welcome on the doll cast show anytime. And it's really funny because achievement unlock both India Willoughby and JK Rowling hate the moderate trans politics of doll cast India attacked us the other day and we responded we were fairly frustrated because we don't feel like she actually watched the show enough to understand what we're doing. I don't know why [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=88.48s)]
*  I mean, I think I do know why Brianna who doesn't get it because she's just a bit like that's it. Okay, that's it. She's just [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=118.68s)]
*  So she I don't think she understands this even as a trans person that like a transphobic person did not logically arrive at the conclusion of transphobia. They didn't logic their way there. Okay, they didn't go Oh, the extreme fringes are scaring me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=128.04s)]
*  Okay, no, they just transphobic people think you are an aberration that must be forcibly excised from society. They think you are a morally degenerate pervert that needs to be killed. Okay, so I don't understand why you try to go to those people and go, no, no, no, you don't understand. We're actually in agreement. We're actually totally in agreement. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  Please recognize my humanity. It's just not going to happen. I'll take it one step further. I have an infinitely easier time converting a transphobic person away from having transphobic positions than Brianna who does especially with that kind of rhetoric. Okay, and the reality of that matter is, it's because I'm a cisgender heterosexual man, because guess what, lo and behold, shockingly enough, transphobic people who are either transphobic or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, transphobic, or heterosexual, trans [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=164.76s)]
*  people who are on, you know, who have this predisposition, or who are on their journey towards like extreme levels of like, in JK Rowling are not going to listen to a trans person because their starting position is that trans people are not normal. And they're [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=194.76s)]
*  been wrong and evil. It is quite aptly put, the dehumanization of trans people. JK Rowling does not see you as a human being. Why the f*** would she ever do that? Anyway, Dreamleaf says, Oh, looks like Brianna's little pick me act isn't working on JK Rowling. Of course it's not. I disagree. The only way, the only way that you can as a trans person get an otherwise transphobic person to no longer be transphobic is by being a cool person, being a cool person. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=208.76s)]
*  Cool and normal person like a co worker or whatever. That is the greatest antidote to be a. All right. It's something that I talk about quite frequently. But someone like JK Rowling, especially when they're making, like, especially when they're getting hug boxed and getting prominence by other like minded psychopathic transphobic people online is is never going to turn around and see you as a human being. That's just as it do you get it? It's something that I talk about quite frequently. If ironically enough, if [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=238.76s)]
*  Brianna Wu wasn't this like stupid f***ing weirdo who was constantly conceding to the whims of transphobes or whatever, and was just like a normal person with normal hobbies, didn't f***ing talk about this shit all the time, and somehow found herself around transphobic people, she could probably actively de radicalize people away from transphobic positions by just existing as a normal person. But she much like many other people, personally think that, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=268.76s)]
*  you can, you can, if you're, if you're a black person, for example, if you, if you kind of lean into the whims of white supremacists, then you'll be able to get white supremacists to recognize your humanity. You won't even be able to get the white supremacists to recognize your own individual humanity as a, as a loyal servant of white supremacy, let alone other black people. That's not how this works. It's ridiculous. Are you always like this? Or was yesterday just special? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=298.76s)]
*  I don't know. Are you going to show up to my house and throw me off a building? Good stuff. Where does the throwing people off buildings this phobia meta come from? I think I is does she mean that in a racist anti Islam way? What does that mean? Yes. This is why I always tell people like you can't, you can't hug and kiss conservatives and like lean into their insanity. Okay. You just can't you can't do that. Like that's not if your goal is to actively decouple them from the whims of reactionary [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=328.76s)]
*  sentiment, you can't do that by compromising with them and telling them like, you know what, honestly, you're right on this. Okay. You can't tolerate their intolerance, because their intolerance is inherently illogical. Their intolerance is not coming from a place of genuine concern, but pure anger. And oftentimes, it is a very apt mechanism of distraction and deflection away from the real vectors of harm and contemporary society. It's stupid. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=358.76s)]
*  This doesn't mean that you should like, I don't know, actively treat every anyone and everyone as though they're [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL98WNUe7gE&t=388.76s)]
