# This Drop Set Almost Destroyed Me | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0)
*  Anyway, yeah, that's then I did another set of five with three 40 on the drop set on my [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=0.0s)]
*  top set, stop and go, you know, clean form overall. Just like I said, there are tweaks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=6.84s)]
*  There's always, it's not like completely perfect, but Oh, before I finished my blast off, I [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=15.4s)]
*  was going to say I ate a metric ton of meats, but also, so hit that back on the conventional [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=21.96s)]
*  bar, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, and MBs. Those of you who kept saying, Oh, Hassan, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=28.36s)]
*  I know you're like close to hitting five hundo on your dead lifts, but that's on the trap [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=33.84s)]
*  bar. That doesn't count. Well, guess what? I was ripping four or fives on the trap bar. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=38.76s)]
*  As you know, already I was ripping them like pretty, pretty hard. I think it was like hitting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=44.28s)]
*  eight with ease, hitting 10 with ease almost, but we're back on, we're back on real dead [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  lifts, not baby dead lifts, not the type of dead lifts that girls do. Okay. But hitting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  a four or five for five. And then I dropped it into three 40 for five. It was one of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=63.48s)]
*  most insane things that my trainers ever made me do. I don't even know if it's like appropriate [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=68.48s)]
*  drop set on deadlifts is, is the most drops it on my top set drop set on my top set of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=74.4s)]
*  deadlifts is crazy work, but I did do it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  And I also used a grippies this time I used like the, the hand grippers, whatever, like [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=86.2s)]
*  the band for a little bit of help. So I guess there is a little bit of cheating there. And [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=93.68s)]
*  I had the belt on of course too, but take a look. And is it none of that? None of that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=98.72s)]
*  stop and go. Okay. It's stop and go. No drop and go just stop and go. Okay. No cheating. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=108.88s)]
*  No cheating. I remember my first PR. This is not my PR. This is not a lifetime PR. This [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=119.16s)]
*  is not even a gym PR. It's just that like there's ups and downs, highs and lows in this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=125.64s)]
*  process. And this is just me [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=130.88s)]
*  full tension all the way. Don't you dare drop that weight. Okay guys, calm down. Eccentric's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=151.48s)]
*  on my top set when I'm doing a drop set, calm down. Jesus Christ, dude is for plays chatters. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=156.08s)]
*  Holy moly. And I'm doing stop and go. If I was dropping it, if I was dropping it and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  momentum to pick it back up, then it's valid. But I'm not doing that. Yeah. I'm doing it [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=179.92s)]
*  correctly. Thank you. Floki. Yeah. My biggest issue with my deadlift form, I think is that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=188.16s)]
*  like I, I pull my ass up first. Like I don't use leverage at all, which unironically makes [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=193.44s)]
*  it harder, like makes the exercise harder. Like, look here, I'll show you right now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=201.2s)]
*  We'll see. You see this? Like I'm not using the leverage. My butt should be, my butt should [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=206.96s)]
*  be like leveraged up, but it's not. It's just like straight lower back. So, and I don't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  know how to, how to figure out the mechanics of it. Like I've never been able to, I've [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=219.44s)]
*  never been able to do it. I think it's like partially because of my height. Look at that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=223.72s)]
*  Look, but goes up first and then upper back goes up. Normally your butt and your upper [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  back are supposed to work in unison, which means that when your butt and your upper back [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  work in unison, you can actually pull way more. So the very fact that I can actually [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=239.8s)]
*  safely pull four or five with this form is crazy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=244.56s)]
*  Just shoot your ass more back. I think it's a, it's a length issue though, for sure. It's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  like, because I'm tall, true strength is from cleaning in the gym. You got long as [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=258.68s)]
*  legs, brother. It's not going to look the way it does for most people. When you hit [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=264.24s)]
*  it, I think I'm not a scientist or a doctor. Make sure you live without the bell. Sometimes [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=266.92s)]
*  to keep your core muscles engaged. Yes. I only put the belt on for my top set. No, just [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  don't shoot your ass more back with your height. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=274.2s)]
*  Shouldn't you be using pads for the height? What do you mean? Do you pull the bar against [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=279.36s)]
*  your shins while doing the motion? It helps with that. But fucks every shins. Yes. My, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=282.92s)]
*  my legs literally are peeled up. My shins are the entire, the entire shin is just busted. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=288.32s)]
*  That's why I pulled the socks up as best to the best of my ability. Anyway. Yeah, that's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  then I did another set of five with three 40 on the drop set on my top set, stop and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=302.76s)]
*  go, you know, clean form overall. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  Just like I said, there are tweaks. There's always, it's not like completely perfect, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=312.38s)]
*  but there is definitely that issue with my, with the way I pull is actually 405 pounds. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=318.98s)]
*  Yeah. I was using straps cheating. I mean, using a belt is cheating points of, of like, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=332.1s)]
*  not cheating, but it helps. The belt is there to keep your core stabilized. Normally, if [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=340.94s)]
*  you have strong enough core, that should already tuck it in, in and of itself. But if you, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=348.74s)]
*  but on really on higher weights, like when I'm doing my top set, I always put the belt [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=354.34s)]
*  on to ensure that there is extra support for abdominal pressure in an effort to make sure [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=360.7s)]
*  that I don't, you know, accidentally tweak something. It's, it's good to do. It's good [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=366.62s)]
*  to do that for safety, regardless of how strong your core is. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  And then the wraps actually help with your forearm strength because your grip strength, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=379.7s)]
*  when you get to a certain, when you get past a certain weight, when you're deadlifting, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=383.74s)]
*  your grip strength is not going to be able to keep up, especially if you're going for [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=389.1s)]
*  like five, six, seven, eight, eight reps. So technically it's not, I mean, it's a joke [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=392.86s)]
*  when I say it's cheating, but it basically, it basically helps you avoid limiting factors [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=400.94s)]
*  in your body that are not limiting factors in your body that normally would get in the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=410.3s)]
*  way. I don't think it's, I don't think it's cheating by the way. I'm joking when I say [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=416.58000000000004s)]
*  Nobody here knows anything about this, but we're listening pretty. You're so right. No, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=420.66s)]
*  there's plenty of people in here. Like Floki is a power lifter. There are plenty of community [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=425.14s)]
*  members who actually lived quite a bit. Also there are actual, there are actual cheating. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  There are actual equipments that are cheating for the record. Oh yeah. I reposted this last [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=437.7s)]
*  night. There are actual, there are actual things you can do to cheat with like gear [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=443.66s)]
*  that you put on, not gear like in steroids, but gear that you put on like a, like a, like [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=449.3s)]
*  a bench press jacket. Have you guys ever seen those? Like those are, those are technically [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=456.22s)]
*  that is technically literally cheating in the sense that they will actually factor in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  two different, like for power lifters, when they're setting records, they will factor [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=468.98s)]
*  in two different numbers. Yeah. That's equipped lifting. Exactly. I don't know what the, what [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  the actual, I guess that is what the terminology is, but like there are, there are different ways, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=480.9s)]
*  I guess not, not cheating, but like there are different ways of like amplifying your strength [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=489.7s)]
*  and that with gear, not steroids, but like things that you wear like a bench jacket, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  a multi-ply single ply. Yeah. If you wear like a, like a bench jacket, then that is [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=500.98s)]
*  technically like you can, you're getting an assistance that, that helps you quite a bit. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=508.26s)]
*  So it definitely, it definitely is a category in and of itself. It's still incredibly difficult [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=513.14s)]
*  to put up the weights. Yeah. Squat shirt, bench shirt, deadlift suit. There's a bunch of stuff [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=519.06s)]
*  like that. What does that even do? It, it offers so much assistance that it literally puts like [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=524.58s)]
*  a couple hundred pounds sometimes on your max bench press. It literally, it literally is, is [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=531.94s)]
*  so stable and, and trying to push you into a certain position that it actually like forces [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=538.4200000000001s)]
*  your body. Like it stiffens your body. It forces your body. Knee wraps is another one as well. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=547.14s)]
*  Yeah. The slingshot, you can't even squat down with a hundred pounds sometimes. Anyway, this is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=553.86s)]
*  like, this is not even, this is not even, this is not novice level shit. This is like extremely [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=559.54s)]
*  niche at that point. Not only is it extremely niche, but it's also expert level. None of you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=568.74s)]
*  ever have to worry about any of this stuff. I'm just using that as a, as a separate example of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=575.3000000000001s)]
*  like what actual lifting aids look like. These are simply just like offering marginal assistance [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=580.74s)]
*  to muscle groups that otherwise would have a harder time and would lower the number like, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=587.94s)]
*  cause you're, cause you're lower back and your ass is way stronger than your forearms. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=594.9s)]
*  And that your, once you get up to a certain amount of weight, when you're deadlifting, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=601.14s)]
*  your forearms can only hold on and grip for so long. It becomes a point of failure that is [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=606.02s)]
*  unnecessary because you literally have more strength in the tank for the actual muscle groups [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=612.66s)]
*  that you're targeting, which is why some people will use these wrist wraps. I'm always, I've always [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=618.02s)]
*  been a mixed grip guy, which am I not even doing mixed grip here? What the fuck? I guess I wasn't. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=624.66s)]
*  That's crazy. I didn't even realize cause of the wraps. I wasn't even mixed gripping. Oh my God. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=630.58s)]
*  Cause of the, cause of the wraps. Yeah. Yeah. I guess like I didn't even realize. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=638.74s)]
*  Do you even know yourself? No. Cause I had the, this is the first time I used wraps in a very long [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=643.14s)]
*  time. We're entering the Manasphere list. Fucking go. Hassan. I've used the left Joe Rogan. This is [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=648.1800000000001s)]
*  not even remotely Manasphere shit. A gym near me has very limited equipment. How can I even get [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=652.6600000000001s)]
*  started for gym for beginners? You don't, I mean, this gym that I go to is also the backyard of my [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=657.3s)]
*  friend's dad's house. It is incredibly limited. And you don't have to, you don't need equipment's [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=663.8599999999999s)]
*  body weight, especially if you're just beginning calisthenics is perfectly fine for you. As long [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=671.4599999999999s)]
*  as you work on form and function. Yeah. You don't need like, you're not going to need 405 pounds on [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=677.14s)]
*  on a bar to do a deadlift anytime soon. Calisthenics are a perfect way to start. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=684.66s)]
*  And they're incredible. And also they are better at like they're there. They help with form. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=691.78s)]
*  They're functional. It'll improve your life and you'll be sexy. All right. Let's blast off. I [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=700.26s)]
*  haven't even blasted off yet. All right. Saturday, fun day. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47G_SfX4G0&t=706.26s)]
