# Tim Dillon DEFENDS Miss Rachel | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8)
*  She is telling me dismantle design as entity piece by piece. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=0.0s)]
*  That's classic, dude. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=3.72s)]
*  Oh, y'all thought this was just about a child that almost got [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=5.88s)]
*  by the Israeli state with American munitions. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=12.0s)]
*  Think again. Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=16.44s)]
*  The dangerous brainwashing continues. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=18.12s)]
*  Miss Rachel doing material support to Hamas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=21.04s)]
*  Anyway, can you watch Tim Dillon talk about Miss Rachel's Gaza video is a pretty great [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=24.64s)]
*  example of calling out the bullshit, anti-Semitic propaganda on a decently big platform. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=31.64s)]
*  I wanted to talk about this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=36.4s)]
*  I don't know much about Miss Rachel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=40.0s)]
*  I haven't consumed much of her content. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  My Godson who was four, I don't think I've ever seen a video of a woman [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=48.96s)]
*  that I don't think is a Miss Rachel fan either. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=54.6s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what he watches. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=58.52s)]
*  Yo, put your Godson on game, dude. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=61.0s)]
*  What is this? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  What is this, bro? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=65.6s)]
*  Your Godson, your Godson needs to be watching Miss Rachel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=67.16s)]
*  But I don't think it's Miss Rachel. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't know what's going on in that household, to be quite honest. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=78.8s)]
*  But Miss Rachel has come under fire. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=82.32s)]
*  She does content for children, singing songs, things like that for kids. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=86.32s)]
*  And Miss Rachel has come under fire because she's spoken out for the children of Gaza [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=94.64s)]
*  who are being starved to death and and killed, bombed and stuff. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=103.08s)]
*  And Miss Rachel, something's wrong with her. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=109.36s)]
*  This woman, I think she's I don't know what's wrong with her. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=113.76s)]
*  She's like mad at this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  What? So Miss Rachel, yeah, I know, I know. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  So this woman is like doesn't understand [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  like why all these kids in Gaza like do have to go like all of them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=132.2s)]
*  She doesn't get it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=137.36s)]
*  She didn't get the memo that like these are not blameless children. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=139.52s)]
*  Finally, someone is saying the truth, the truth that is so hard to come by. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=145.84s)]
*  Finally, someone else. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=150.84s)]
*  But guys, he's being sarcastic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=152.24s)]
*  It's a joke. He's a comedian. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=154.52s)]
*  He's joking on his comedy podcast. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=156.08s)]
*  Just going to let you know he is. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=158.72s)]
*  This is the autistic man explains the autistic community. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=162.08s)]
*  The structure of a joke hour of this broadcast. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=166.52s)]
*  Once again, I made the bro thought jokes would fly mistake [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=169.04s)]
*  as I do all the time on this community. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=174.12s)]
*  OK, he is showcasing how insane the counter narratives against Miss Rachel are [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=177.24s)]
*  by assuming their position and and, you know, entertaining their position [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=184.12s)]
*  as though it is the truth. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=189.56s)]
*  OK, it's a little misdirection there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=191.12s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  In an effort to like lean into what people say about Miss Rachel, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=195.0s)]
*  he is showcasing that the people who hate Miss Rachel are in the wrong [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=198.84s)]
*  and also insane people, as a matter of fact. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=204.04s)]
*  OK, at Grok, explain this joke. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=208.08s)]
*  They are part of. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=211.72s)]
*  A very, very dangerous [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=215.4s)]
*  terrorist organization, and they have to be. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=219.84s)]
*  And I mean, there's people that are coming on saying this, by the way, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=225.32s)]
*  Dr. I not wolf is out going the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=228.24s)]
*  Hamas represents the genuine desires of the Palestinian people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Another guy just came out and will play him later, saying that like, hey, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=237.2s)]
*  there's not really anybody innocent over there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=240.68s)]
*  There's no such thing as innocent people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=243.6s)]
*  And so and of course. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=246.16s)]
*  So it's odd to me that Miss Rachel is not figuring this out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=250.2s)]
*  She's like, just yeah, because she must be a deeply anti-Semitic person, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=255.27999999999997s)]
*  because everybody knows if you want to be, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=261.88s)]
*  if you want to be someone who is not an anti-Semite, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=266.84s)]
*  you have to assume that all Jewish people, no matter where they live, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=271.47999999999996s)]
*  love unlimited baby murder. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=277.32s)]
*  OK, this is the least anti-Semitic position you can arrive at. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  The notion that Jewish people actually look at the current Holocaust [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=285.32s)]
*  going on in Gaza and go, please, I love that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=289.84s)]
*  This is for me and I want more of it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  This is somehow this is somehow [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=295.2s)]
*  the least anti-Semitic position you can arrive at. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  And anyone that says, hey, I actually don't like that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=302.12s)]
*  Maximum anti-Semitic anti-Semitism, maximum, maximum anti-Semitism. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=306.32s)]
*  Looking at these kids and going, why do we keep killing these kids? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=312.28s)]
*  And there's a good reason. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=318.24s)]
*  There's always a good reason for children being killed, literally always. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=319.8s)]
*  And it bothers me when people make it simple, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=325.88s)]
*  like people make it really simple and it's like the world is not that simple. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=329.8s)]
*  When I see a child being killed, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=335.24s)]
*  the first thing I do is step back and take a moment. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=337.68s)]
*  I take a moment and I think about history [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=341.68s)]
*  and I think about the layers and the complexity, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=344.76s)]
*  the ins and the outs, and that's what I do. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=349.0s)]
*  Miss Rachel, this dumb bitch. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=352.68s)]
*  Don't say bless you. It's science you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  OK, you can say Albert Einstein, you can say facts, logic and reasoning. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=358.0s)]
*  You do not say bless you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=362.72s)]
*  OK, I treat it as a microaggression. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  There is no blessing in this community. OK. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=368.44000000000005s)]
*  Say, say Matthew or something. OK. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=371.88s)]
*  By the way, she sees a kid being killed and he's like, stop it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=375.64000000000004s)]
*  Stop killing that kid. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=379.32000000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, wait a minute. Why don't you read the book? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=380.96s)]
*  How about some study? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  When I see a kid being killed, I immediately open a book [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  and I begin to read the book and I and I'll find the answer. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=392.84s)]
*  I don't know where chapter three. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  This guy is saying what dumb guys say when they want to sound smart. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=398.88s)]
*  I think about history and read a book. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  He's oh my God. OK, anyway. Yeah, it's good. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=403.64s)]
*  I'm glad that Tim Dillon is defending Miss Rachel. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=407.12s)]
*  We have to do more defensive Miss Rachel. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Shelton race. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=413.2s)]
*  There's never enough defensive Miss Rachel in my book Rock Ruckus. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=414.12s)]
*  But the biggest performance of the night went to Janet Jackson. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=421.76s)]
*  No, I wanted to watch it. OK, fine. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  I wanted to talk about wing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=429.56s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=433.4s)]
*  What is this? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=436.2s)]
*  So she is, you know, understandably ignorant [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=438.4s)]
*  of the need to, you know, there's always a reason. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=443.64s)]
*  It's we're not just running around killing kids, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=447.0s)]
*  unless it's a necessary thing to be done. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=450.88s)]
*  They're right. I mean, oh, duh. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=455.44s)]
*  So this whack job, OK, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=460.08s)]
*  to make some political point, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=464.4s)]
*  I don't want to see politics when I'm watching a children's show. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=466.6s)]
*  I now miss Rachel is politicizing her children show [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=472.20000000000005s)]
*  with Hamas propaganda. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  Let's take a look. And by the way, this is yeah, this is nice. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  Bathroom is correct. This is called exposure therapy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=485.0s)]
*  A lot of you have never even encountered a joke in the wild. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  OK, or at least like the only type of jokes [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=491.88s)]
*  that you have encountered in the wild are in the meme format. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=494.8s)]

*  was allowed into the Gaza Strip with the IDF, of course, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=719.88s)]

*  that he was killed in fighting till the very last moment. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=730.76s)]
*  And Douglas Murray was trying to own Dave Smith, comedian Dave Smith, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=734.44s)]
*  who is pro-Palestine by claiming that you can't talk about Israel [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=739.6s)]
*  because you haven't been there, which is like a very, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=745.52s)]
*  which is a very common technique that Israel defenders apply [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  when they go, oh, you just haven't seen Israel or you haven't been to the Gaza Strip. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=753.96s)]

*  One must ask the question why people are not allowed to go to the Gaza Strip. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=759.92s)]
*  But of course, no one ever asked that fucking question. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=766.0s)]

*  It is, ironically, the same exact position that Andrew Tate tried to [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=775.76s)]
*  try to use against me in our famous debate, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=781.72s)]
*  where I was trying to explain to him the importance of, you know, empirical evidence, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=785.64s)]

*  the world around us. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=795.0s)]
*  And and he there was that famous moment where I was like, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=796.96s)]
*  you don't think the earth is flat. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=800.76s)]
*  He's like, no, it's not. Well, how do you know? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=802.4s)]
*  It feels flat. Have you been on a spaceship? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=804.64s)]
*  Have you been on a rocket ship and flew to fucking, you know, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=808.6s)]
*  flew outside of the atmosphere to take a take a look and see how not flat it actually is? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=811.9599999999999s)]
*  No. So obviously, you know, you rely on this stuff, too. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=817.36s)]
*  Have you seen how bloodthirsty the average American is? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=821.72s)]
*  No shot is 20 percent. Yes. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  But Americans are also incredibly selfish. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=824.76s)]
*  Americans also fancy themselves to be. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=827.8s)]
*  Americans also fancy themselves to be peaceful people. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=831.68s)]
*  Debate that was a dog walk. Yeah, it was. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=837.56s)]
*  It was a dog walk. And it literally it was one of the most consequential debates [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=841.0799999999999s)]
*  of my career, because after that, the entirety of the blue checkmark, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=846.76s)]
*  like power farmers and meme accounts turned so aggressively. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=851.8399999999999s)]
*  That caused me to. Yeah, that caused me to get fucking. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=856.68s)]
*  OK, this is it. I made Andrew Tate run away in a debate. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=860.4799999999999s)]
*  Two point eight million views two years ago, three years ago. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, this also, in my opinion, was the beginning of the end. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=866.56s)]
*  Up until this moment, everyone was just like glazing him and no one who would [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=870.4799999999999s)]
*  who had been around him and actually like held his feet to the fire a little bit. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=874.16s)]

*  It's also yet another great example of the audience doesn't know better than me [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=881.16s)]
*  sometimes because they everyone overwhelmingly was telling me, don't talk to him. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  Don't talk to him. Don't talk to him. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=889.04s)]
*  You're going to platform him. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=890.7199999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, he was on a fucking spaceship. OK, he was platforming me. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=891.92s)]
*  Anyway, all the sacks and your suburbs don't understand [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=896.48s)]

*  Maybe you're confused. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=906.0799999999999s)]
*  You better get the memo. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=907.8399999999999s)]
*  You better get the program as to why we needed that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  She needs to have no legs. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=913.48s)]
*  But you'd understand that if you weren't so goddamn soft [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=915.0s)]
*  to everyone in the West is soft [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iB8q55tu8&t=919.64s)]
