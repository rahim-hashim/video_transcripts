*  that Israel doesn't have such a ginormous ginormous tech gap with everybody else on the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=241.36s)]

*  as I am of Israel. Erm, erming, erming. Clearly Israel doesn't have the Star Destroyer. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=449.68s)]
*  Holy shit, I can't believe I'm making this video. A Star Destroyer would exceed the pyramids of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  Giza and could not fit beneath residential buildings. Also, what the fuck does he mean [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=464.56s)]
*  they're storing submarines underneath the buildings? I'm a submarine veteran. So yeah, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=469.36s)]

*  what you do is you actually put the submarine. Oh God, we are so, our military is so ass bro. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=477.76s)]

*  here. And then the dry dock, you know, there's like a wall that comes up, they pump the water out and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  you know, the whole entire submarine is exposed. They have permanent ones and they have floating [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=510.88s)]
*  dry docks, but it wouldn't be underneath a residential building. I don't, I don't even [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=514.56s)]
*  know how that would work. You'd have to have some kind of like floating city, which you know what, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=518.24s)]
*  I'm not even going to get into this. This does look like a perps little jab at Israel, given how [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=524.88s)]
*  Israel often defense strikes and Gaza by claiming military usage. Fun fact, there's a nation in the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=529.1999999999999s)]

*  are so desperate says the yellow ribbon account. That's because the average Iran supporter IQ is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=549.2800000000001s)]
*  approximately one to three. So they'll believe almost anything. This is such a funny cell phone [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=553.44s)]
*  because everyone like, this is a meme about what Israel defenders choose to believe. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=558.8s)]
*  And all of the Israel defenders are all of the Israel defenders. They're like, if you believe [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=567.28s)]
*  this, you're a fucking moron. It's like, yeah, no, that's what we've been saying. That's what [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=573.92s)]

*  disagreements with people. Look at the proposed community notes to the original post. Israel does [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=602.24s)]
*  not store submarines and apartment buildings. They are based at the hyphen naval base. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=608.0s)]
*  What everyone on X knows this to the monitors are word, but this unequivocally confirms. Is this AI [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=612.0s)]
*  video showing a monk dude? They're so, they're so, they're so mad. I love that this doesn't have a [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00x6m-ieUaE&t=617.76s)]
