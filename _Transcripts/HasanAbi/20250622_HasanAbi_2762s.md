# The Real Reason They Bomb | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4)
*  And then politicians will redirect that anger, as Donald Trump did, appropriately to different [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=0.0s)]
*  targets that are vulnerable and marginalized. And you'll think, maybe if we deport the Guatemalan [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=6.32s)]
*  guy that's like picking my avocados, then this country will finally be better. I'll be able to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=13.84s)]
*  own a home. You won't. Maybe if we stop like a trans athlete in high school from participating in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=19.68s)]
*  a swim meet. The supreme leader is and indeed the whole of the uranium. By the way, the International [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=25.28s)]
*  Atomic Energy Agency Chief Rafael Gracie says, Irama's account of its 400 kilogram stockpile of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  uranium enriched to 60%. And you know what's really funny about this? This right here shows [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=40.8s)]
*  that the International Atomic Energy Agency that is supposed to be a completely, completely [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=51.2s)]
*  independent agency, okay, is directly and I will say this, they're not like until recently, they [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  haven't been this aggressively western slanted. In spite of the fact that 70% of all of their funding, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=68.0s)]
*  70% of all of their funding is directly about Iran. Okay. This is proof that they are not invested [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=77.52s)]
*  in anything but working in service of US interests, US and Israeli interests, especially considering [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=89.36s)]
*  that right now the International Atomic Energy Agency's primary focus should be the fact that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  America bombed nuclear facilities. Okay. America bombed nuclear facilities. You are the International [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=105.84s)]
*  Atomic Energy Agency. Your primary focus should be what took place yesterday. Israel has been [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  b**** Iranian nuclear facilities for the past week. America just bombed Iranian nuclear facilities [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=121.04s)]
*  with bunker busters. What are you doing? How can anyone see this group as anything but an arm of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  western imperialism at this point? Where is the interest in presenting the dangers, presenting the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=135.04s)]
*  dangers that America has created for potential radiation, contamination, potential contamination, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=143.28s)]
*  potential radiation? What are we talking about? Isn't that your job? Iran allegedly gathered a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=150.64s)]
*  lot of info that showed collaboration between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=157.44s)]
*  I mean, the other side of this, of course, is the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=162.0s)]
*  Israel has nuclear weapons. Israel is not even a party to NPT and they have nukes. And we know [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  they have nukes. Here's the danger. Iran with a nuclear bomb. Iran with a nuclear bomb is only a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=178.16s)]
*  danger to you if you have ambitions of regime change in Iran and if you have ambitions of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=184.32s)]
*  turning Iran into a fail state. Are you John Bolton? Are you an American general that has [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=191.76s)]
*  tremendous appetite for indisputable in Iran? Because yes, it is a danger if Iran has sovereignty. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=199.68s)]
*  If Iran has sovereignty, then it is a real danger. It's a danger to your interest in the region. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=206.72s)]
*  But if you're just like a regular person, if you're a regular ass dude, the notion of like [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=214.32s)]
*  Iran having a significant danger because they're going to use it is insane. Iran is infinitely more [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=219.68s)]
*  restrained than Israel. Iran has been infinitely more restrained than Israel. Okay? Israel has nukes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=226.88s)]
*  There's also only one psychotic country on the planet that has ever used not one but two nukes [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  on a civilian population that it was directly in war with, and that is the United States of America. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=243.36s)]
*  Other countries that are supposed to be incredibly scary have never actually escalated to nuclear [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  warfare. And this even includes Russia, modern Russia. This certainly includes the USSR as well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=254.56s)]
*  To go in your direction, North Korea is showing restraint for now with it. Yes! No, that's my [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=259.92s)]
*  point. I was about to say yes. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea. North Korea has nukes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=264.88s)]
*  The entire point of having nukes at this stage is to have sovereignty if you are outside. Why [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=270.88s)]
*  do you hate the US so much? Le Mafeil. Oh my God. Look at what is taking place right now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=276.64s)]
*  America does not give a fuck about you. How do you not understand that? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=284.08s)]
*  My beef is not with the American people. My beef is with the American government that very clearly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=289.76s)]
*  does not give a shit about you. Every single dollar spent on fucking Iran is a dollar that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=296.64s)]
*  could have been spent on making sure that your children get educated, making sure that your roads [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  are paved, making sure that you have better broadband, making sure that you have health care. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=306.4s)]
*  But a lot of you guys eat that propaganda so hard where you're like, those guys are scary, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=311.2s)]
*  so we have to bomb them into oblivion. And actually, it's fine. We have to bomb them into [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  oblivion for a foreign nation's interest, Israel's interest in the region, and Israel's greater [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=320.96s)]
*  ambition in the region. And that's cool for me. That's fine by me because it's real scary. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=325.84s)]
*  I've been told that these guys are really scary. This is literally people...the American government [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  isn't even making an attempt at pushing 2004 style propaganda, and Americans are just doing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=336.96s)]
*  that to themselves. How crazy, how insane. The Iranian foreign minister gave an entire speech [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  a very important primary document. Iran's foreign minister gives first press briefing after the US [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  attack, stresses how this was a blow not just to Iran, but the UN system and the NPT. He says, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=359.76s)]
*  humanity has come too far as a species to allow a lawless bully to take us back to the law of the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  jungle, except we are living in the law of the jungle. And this guy thinks that Western countries [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  have a conscience. You can only appeal to the logic and sensibilities of groupings of nation [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=377.04s)]
*  states that have a conscience. America does not have one. It is the law of the jungle. These guys [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=388.56s)]
*  are almost delusional in the way that they operate, thinking that America and Israel are going to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=395.92s)]
*  be pressured by Western nations. It is very obvious that Western nations are only operating [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=404.16s)]
*  with one singular purpose in the region. They do not care how many people die in the process. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  They don't even care if their people die. They don't care if your friends, your neighbors, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=417.68s)]
*  your family members are over there and are a part of the 40,000 troops that are positioned all around [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=423.68s)]
*  Iran. If they get killed in the process, so be it. Because ultimately, American GDP will go up. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=429.44s)]
*  You won't see any of the benefits of that, by the way. Even the bounty of empire will not actually [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  turn around. Even the bounty of empire will not turn around and benefit your wallets in the process, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=440.48s)]
*  by the way. But it's all good. The line goes up. Israel gets to pursue its interests. It's fantastic. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=445.92s)]
*  It's totally, totally great. It's great for everybody, except it's not great for you at all. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=453.2s)]
*  But you have been deluded into thinking that there is a scary enemy out there and we just have [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=457.44s)]
*  to destroy them. We can't let them live normal lives, have their citizens go through the regular [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=462.96s)]
*  process of civil struggle so they can modernize, have more civil liberties in the process. We just [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=469.12s)]
*  have to constantly never offer the moment of respite to lick their wounds and to develop their [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=474.4s)]
*  societies. They have to constantly be fearful of American incursion. They have to constantly be [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=481.12s)]
*  fearful of American campaigns. And every now and then we will blow them up. Look, and as long as [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=486.08s)]
*  this kind of attitude persists, lul, is equal good, USA equals bad. As long as this kind of attitude [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=493.12s)]
*  persists amongst the American population, the broader American population, America will continue [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=498.8s)]
*  getting away with it. They'll keep stealing your lunch money. You'll keep going back to your shit [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=503.76s)]
*  ass job with the hopes that one day maybe you'll be able to own a home and you'll never own a home [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  and you'll just get further and further resentful and more and more angry. And then politicians will [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=514.24s)]
*  redirect that anger, as Donald Trump did appropriately, to different targets that are [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=519.44s)]
*  vulnerable and marginalized. And you'll think maybe if we deport the Guatemalan guy that's like [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=525.44s)]
*  picking my avocados, then this country will finally be better. I'll be able to own a home. You won't. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  Maybe if we stop like a trans athlete in high school from participating in a swim meet, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=538.4s)]
*  will I actually improve my life? You won't. And you'll just keep getting angrier and angrier and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=543.52s)]
*  angrier as all of the dollars that you contribute to creating at your shit ass job will go back. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=549.6s)]
*  All the tax that you pay will go back to endless unlimited buying and unlimited and unlimited [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=557.84s)]
*  and you won't get anything. But hey, Lockheed Martin will have incredible returns on their [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=564.0s)]
*  initial investments year over year. Raytheon, Boeing, Halliburton, not the people that even [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=569.12s)]
*  work there ironically enough, just the people that own stocks in these companies. You won't be that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=575.92s)]
*  person, but it won't matter. You'll just delude yourself into thinking that your life is better [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=581.52s)]
*  year over year. Do you just relate trans athletes to taxpayer money mismanagement? Yes, I did. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=587.44s)]
*  Are you too stupid to understand the direct through line? You're angry because your life is [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=595.44s)]
*  not improving. Your life is not improving because we spend all of the money on doing wars overseas [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=601.44s)]
*  and increasing militancy around the world and creating instability and chaos. And when you're [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=608.32s)]
*  angry, one party takes that anger and redirects it to vulnerable populations that have no control [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  over this process whatsoever, that haven't done anything to you. Trans athletes would be a perfect [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=620.88s)]
*  example of this, but you have been so invested in this notion that as long as we eradicate [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=626.2399999999999s)]
*  transgenderism from American society, that my life will be better, that you think they're doing this [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=632.8s)]
*  for you. When they say we're banning the 40 trans athletes from participating in high school and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=638.88s)]
*  collegiate athletics, you literally are stupid enough to think, oh, my government cares about [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=644.64s)]
*  me. This is something that I totally wanted. And when the truth is staring you right in the eyes, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=650.56s)]
*  you always have to resort back to thought terminating cliches, thought terminating cycles. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=659.52s)]
*  You go, oh, this guy's a, he loves the enemy. You think I haven't heard this before? You think this [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=664.8s)]
*  is my first foray? This is exactly what people said during the Iraq campaign that was also illegal [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=669.6s)]
*  and unjustifiable and incredibly bloody. And what happened then? Now, 20 years after the fact, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=676.88s)]
*  you turn around and go, yeah, that was a mistake. Yeah, if we survive 20 more years, maybe you'll [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=684.32s)]
*  turn around and go, yeah, maybe it was a mistake to go into an extended conflict with a nation with [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=690.08s)]
*  92 million people. All the money that went to that instead of back to things that would improve my [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=694.8s)]
*  life. But yeah, keep going. Keep going. Oh, yeah, the people that demand a change, the people that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=703.12s)]
*  want America to improve, America to do right by its own citizens. Those are the people who are [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=709.68s)]
*  as mold is encouraging that is considered reasonable. Yet you saying that our tax should [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=717.36s)]
*  be used to benefit us instead of killing people is considered mind blowing. Yes. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=721.04s)]
*  As the president returned to Washington, lace and the swagger were maybe a hint of what was to come. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=724.4s)]
*  He was back. We had been told just for yeah, here it is. This is a good Nick Mullen tweet. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=734.64s)]
*  2043 Lindsey Graham being kept alive by stem cells extracted from the testicles of a five year old. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=739.52s)]
*  Of course, the war with Iran was a mistake. We all know that Qatar is different. They don't let gay [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=744.72s)]
*  people drive. Yeah. Can't wait. Can't wait for all the tags, the hot takes. Like you are not a part [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=750.88s)]

*  the West. And now we trust them even less. When asked whether Iran still has faith in diplomacy, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1513.44s)]
*  the foreign minister replied, we never trust the Western countries when we negotiated with them. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1518.0s)]

*  we're going to see what that period of time is, but I'm giving them a period of time and I [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1743.98s)]

*  Which video was privated? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1867.54s)]
*  I'm just going to interrupt you for one minute Ali because we're looking at some images that have come in in the aftermath of some strikes that the strikes the ballistic missile strikes that Iran launched on Israel and we understand this is from central as well as northern Israel which is where the alerts were coming in from. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1869.54s)]
*  Of course we got an alert here in Jerusalem. Central Israel over the course of the last few days has been hit quite hard. Haifa has been hit and as has Tel Aviv. So this nation on high alert you can see some of the damage done in those images. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1885.54s)]
*  Yeah I've been to many of the impact strikes over the last few days and the damage is extensive. I mean do not underestimate the damage a ballistic missile can do not just at the direct site of impact but the blast wave that it gives off will blow out windows, blow off roof tiles, literally tip cars over. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1907.54s)]
*  For a pretty big radius, a 1500 meter radius around. Now one of the reasons that the death toll in Israel has been relatively low is because of safe rooms. Not every house has a safe room although modern houses is absolutely part of the permissions you must get is to have what's called a mamad, a safe room in your house. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1931.54s)]
*  But people have they know where their bunkers are so they go to them and that helps save lives here. Also the alarm system is incredibly sophisticated and people obey it and that helps keep keeps the death toll very low despite what you're watching here which is massive massive destruction. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1953.54s)]
*  Yeah and it's. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1973.54s)]
*  This is part of the reason why I said this is part of the reason why I said that the American intervention was for two different reasons. The American intervention was so that Iran would change its focus to American assets in the region also in an effort to get the American [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1974.54s)]
*  The American intervention was for two different reasons. The American intervention was so that Iran would change its focus to American assets in the region also in an effort to also in an effort to change his attention and his strike priorities away from Israel because Israel's air defenses are diminished. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=1989.54s)]
*  I think this right here shows that reality proves that reality because the very fact for the record when you say why is Iran not targeting Israel's military bases we don't know. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2012.54s)]
*  And the reason why we don't know if Iran is successfully striking Israel's military targets is because Israel has a severe censorship regime implemented over the country where even though Iran has been striking military assets whether it's anti air defense systems or whether it's actually military bases. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2025.54s)]
*  We don't see that this. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2049.54s)]
*  This is why I've been saying for the past week that when you see any sort of successful strikes from Israel that means the Israeli government allowed you to see it because it plays a role in this narrative. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2051.54s)]
*  Remember that. Why are you pretending like Iran got some superpower. They're just too scared to unleash it. When when when have I said that I didn't say that at all. What are you talking about. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2066.54s)]
*  I've been pretty reasonable with my analysis on Iran's capabilities and Iran's Iran's strike priorities and what Iran has done so far judging by what Iran has done in the past. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2077.54s)]
*  I don't think that Iran has like a secret weapon. I don't have any sort of hopium copium any sort of thing like that at all. If anything people constantly say I'm too pessimistic about where this this conflict will go. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2093.54s)]
*  You acting like Iran could do some devastating attack on Israel or America but they can't. No actually if you were to listen to my words. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2107.54s)]
*  I'm saying the exact opposite of that. I'm not saying Iran has the capabilities of doing a devastating attack on America. I'm saying that Iran could attack American assets in the region with medium range ballistic missiles that are directly in the in the strike distance. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2115.54s)]
*  While still continuing to lob hypersonics in the direction of Tel Aviv and also the military assets in Tel Aviv as well or around Israel proper. But I think you're not listening to my words. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2131.54s)]
*  I'm saying that it is clear that Israel's air defenses are diminished. If that wasn't the case then Iranian drones would not be able to strike yesterday and the day prior targets within Tel Aviv. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2144.54s)]
*  And that is what we know of. That is what we have seen thus far. It's kind of an odd thing to say while we're looking at the impact strike of an Iranian missile that previously is considered unprecedented. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2158.54s)]
*  Previously this kind of retaliation that Israeli society could experience was unimaginable. People who go like what are you talking about? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2172.54s)]
*  I think a lot of you forgot Operation True Promise 1 and Operation True Promise 2 showed that Iran had ballistic missile capabilities that could actually penetrate the Iron Dome, the Arrow defense systems and David's sling, which is precisely the reason why America sent in defense systems. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2182.54s)]
*  And yet even with that and with all of these anti-ballistic systems that Israel has, Iran's missiles have still consistently hit Israel virtually every single day. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2199.54s)]
*  Yesterday they did not send any ballistic missiles. The day prior they only spent drones. They only sent drones and drones that actually passed through the Iron Dome, the Tamir interceptors that they have, which was also unique. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2218.54s)]
*  This means that their anti-air defense systems are spent. They are exhausted. There are clearly issues with Israeli defense. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2235.54s)]
*  This is the first time that Israel is experiencing repercussions for its dangerous escalations in the region. Israeli society is for the first time ever experiencing direct damage. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2249.54s)]
*  A fraction of the damage that Israel brings about the entire region that dishes out to all of its neighbors, whether it be southern Lebanon, whether it be Lebanon in general, whether it be Gaza, obviously Gaza is completely hollowed out at this point. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2264.54s)]
*  It's just one massive crater. This has been an incredibly costly endeavor. That interceptor, not that interceptor, sorry. Tamir interceptors are, I believe, 200,000 a pop and they're lobbying a ton every night. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2279.54s)]
*  There was one example of a hypersonic that they sent, just one. 26 Tamir interceptors were launched to try and intercept as a last resort this one hypersonic missile and that ballistic missile hit the target directly. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2294.54s)]
*  This kind of tit for tat is also a war of attrition, an attrition and exhaustion of resources and a way to deplete the existing anti-air defenses that Israel has. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2310.54s)]
*  And while Israel claimed that they had a runway of like at least two weeks, we don't know what their stockpiles obviously look like. It's understandably confidential information. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2325.54s)]
*  The way that we can make an assessment on how much their missile stock has depleted is by looking at the actual impact. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2337.54s)]
*  And considering that early on when Iran was expending their older missiles and sending barrages, sometimes 100 at a time, and having most of them get intercepted with like one or two, if not 10, directly striking Israel. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2347.54s)]
*  Now Iran is spending, Iran is sending ballistic missiles maybe two, three, four, five at a time and the actual percentage of successful strikes has increased dramatically. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2366.54s)]
*  It went from 10% success rate to like 60%, 70% success rate. That is a real issue for Israel. So either they have to keep flying over Iranian airspace that they now dominate as their claim is, and try to find the launchers and blow them up as quickly as possible with the hopes that they don't have additional launchers out there that they can use. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2386.54s)]
*  Or they can still continue lobbing hypersonic missiles directly at Israel's direction, which that's what they've been trying to do. Or they have to magically invent new missiles and there's only a finite amount. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2416.54s)]
*  And there's also a missile production that will take a tremendous amount of time. I was skeptical of hypersonics before this war, but these attacks show me that they're extremely effective. Yes. I mean, they've been hitting hypersonics. They've sent one cluster one as well. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2432.54s)]
*  The other day with the one that hit the hospital, what does it mean to mine the Strait of Hormuz? The Strait of Hormuz is like a 32 miles or 32 kilometers. It's like a much tinier waterway that Iran could take complete control over with mines. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2448.54s)]
*  It's very narrow. It's a narrow passage in a obviously like a much broader sea. This is the satellite image. The Strait of Hormuz is a strait between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It provides the only sea passage from the Persian Gulf to the world's most strategically important choke points. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2476.54s)]
*  Now, the reason why it's a strategically important choke point is because 20% of all of the global oil comes from that choke point. It has to pass through. There is tremendous amounts of commerce, tremendous amounts of vessels that pass through for international trade. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2498.54s)]
*  But more significantly than that, there's a lot of oil barrels that pass through this tiny patch of water that can be easily mined and not easily, but like that can be controlled at least for an extended period of time that will be unimaginably disruptive to global trade. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2518.54s)]
*  Yeah, a third of the world's liquefied natural gas and almost 25% of total global oil consumption passes through the strait, making it a highly important strategic location for international trade. It has been so for centuries. Its vast hinterlands were rich in luxury trade goods with no easy access to lucrative trading ports. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2535.54s)]
*  And as of today, the Iranian parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz in response to recent US strikes on Iran nuclear facilities. If it's successfully blocked for an extended period of time, you will see you will experience a oil shock. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2551.54s)]
*  That's a sophisticated alert system that Iran doesn't have. In fact, many Iranians were talking about not knowing exactly when they should move, although the Israelis have said that they've sent them alerts or there have been phone calls, automated phone calls, very much out of the Lebanon playbook where they were telling them to get out. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2564.54s)]
*  Yeah, I should say as well, it is worth noting that alarm system does not exist for Palestinians in the West Bank. For example, they don't have shelters and there haven't been any missile strikes there, but falling debris has fallen there. Occasionally, I say that, I think a missile did land quite close to Hebron the other day. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2584.54s)]
*  The same goes for the Bedouin community in Israel as well. They often make the point that they don't have shelters, they don't have access to shelters. So that is always a problem. But yeah, the system here, the home front command system here is incredibly sophisticated, developed, of course, over many, many years of conflict. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2602.54s)]
*  But it is trusted, it is obeyed, and that does save lives. I was actually at a strike point the other day where a missile went directly into a safe room, and it did kill people in the safe room. But they say that as long as it doesn't literally hit you directly in that particular room that you're in, your chances of survival are very good indeed. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2623.54s)]
*  Yeah, and many people question, you know, the number of ballistic missiles that have come Israel's way. Why is it that the death toll isn't higher? And it's exactly that point that people follow the sort of requirements and the rules that have been set out for them, and they get these alerts and stay underground. And that's why we have seen injuries. We saw a hospital hit the other day. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2643.54s)]
*  Also, schools have been told and other public places, people have been told, stay indoors, go into your bunkers, because, Ali, they do expect more ballistic missiles coming Israel's way. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2665.54s)]
*  Look, it's five to nine on Sunday morning. This is the first day of the working week. And I know you're watching these pictures, but behind main roads in central Jerusalem near the old city, and I can see three or four cars and that's it. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2678.54s)]
*  At this time on a normal Sunday morning, it would be busy, busy traffic, but people are staying at home. They're not going to work. They're not venturing very far from their homes. And they're staying there because of the risk that is still being posed by Iranian missiles coming in. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2691.54s)]
*  Yeah, very much so. And this country, this nation, as well as this region, Israeli economy is over. I mean, this is, I'm sure, not great for the Israeli economy, but the Israeli economy is basically propped up by the Western world anyway. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2706.54s)]
*  So I don't know, is currently now on high alert and the images you're looking at right now from a barrage of ballistic missiles that came Israel's way in the last 45 minutes or an hour or so. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2722.54s)]
*  Don't worry, guys, we'll give another $20 trillion to Israel, you know, of course, are following all the developments here from the ground. We've got our correspondence across the region. We'll be getting reaction from them. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2737.54s)]
*  So do stay with us, but we are going to leave you with these images for now. We'll be back in the next few minutes. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWzvhApYhR4&t=2750.54s)]
