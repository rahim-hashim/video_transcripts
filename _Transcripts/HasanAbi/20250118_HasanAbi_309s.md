**HasanAbi:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0)
*  bet that this won't be talked about on a lot of Western channels. Sky news is covering it here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=0.0s)]
*  Revealing the Gaza deal. Israel just signed has been on the table for 13 months since December, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=6.0s)]
*  2023, 13 months. And the deal itself is identical to previous deals that Hamas had put forward [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=10.32s)]
*  on multiple in multiple different occasions. Okay. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=19.2s)]
*  Okay. We'll, we'll get started on Israel for the most annoying, for the most annoying f*****g [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=23.12s)]
*  chatters who probably left. They're going to be very upset that they're going to miss this coverage. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=34.24s)]
*  So f**k them. Cause this is usually the most annoying group. That's like, if you're not [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  literally talking about Israel, I don't want to be a part of this community. And I'm not going to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=44.64s)]
*  blast off that I'm here then and covering Israel. So I hope they miss my delicious commentary that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=49.92s)]
*  I desperately want. All right. Whatever you do, don't pick and eat the scars in your nose. It [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  will take forever for it to heal. Pick and eat new video on bad and bananas main channel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=61.28s)]
*  I don't, I'm not going to watch another bad and banana video right now. Yeah. When they come in, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=67.92s)]
*  when they come in three hours later, be like, Oh, I had no idea you were streaming. Why didn't you [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=73.04s)]
*  tell us you swapped away from my role? I'm going to ban them permanently. I'm just letting you know [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=76.72s)]
*  what's going to happen. They're going to come in and they're going to come in and like the next [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  hour and be like, dude, Oh dude, I just, why didn't you f*****g inform us that you were no longer doing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=84.8s)]
*  stupid ass basketball s**t. You were back at, you were back at your desk doing politics [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=92.8s)]
*  and we're going to ban them. This is the framework that we have signed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=98.08s)]
*  two days ago is the same. So here's the Qatari prime minister revealing what we knew for the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=102.24s)]
*  longest time. I'm willing to bet that this won't be talked about on a lot of Western channels. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=109.36s)]
*  Sky news is covering it here. Revealing that the Gaza deal Israel just signed has been on the table [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=114.72s)]
*  for 13 months since December, 2023, 13 months. And the deal itself is identical to previous deals [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=119.28s)]
*  that Hamas had put forward on multiple, in multiple different occasions. Okay. And framework [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=127.84s)]
*  that we agreed on. Yes. Hoss quarters are who I'm going to ban. Those are the most annoying [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=134.88s)]
*  motherf*****s December 23, which is basically 13 months of a waste of negotiating details [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=139.68s)]
*  that has no meaning and doesn't work any single life that we lost in Gaza or any single life [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=147.52s)]
*  of those hostages that lost their life because of the one, because they are among everyone else. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=153.52s)]
*  Israel's security cabinet finally signed off on the deal after delays following internal squabbling. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=158.56s)]
*  Qatar's prime minister says all involved must seize this opportunity for peace. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=164.88s)]
*  I believe it's the moment for all of us today to think about what's on the broader picture. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  How can we have a peaceful Middle East? How can we have a Palestinian state next to Israeli state [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=175.28s)]
*  living side by side by each other peacefully? And that's what we are aiming for. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Sheikh Mohammed Abdul Rahman Al Tani also praised President Trump and his special envoy, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=185.6s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, for getting the deal over the line. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=191.28s)]
*  We believe President Trump can create a greater impact for the region and Steve Witkoff, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=195.04s)]
*  the special envoy to the Middle East, has demonstrated leadership in these negotiations. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=200.32s)]
*  And we see the way he fought for a deal to happen. And I believe if this will continue to be [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=207.52s)]
*  the attitude and approach for the next four years, we can create a lot of good things for the region. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  Qatar has been at the center of negotiations since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=222.24s)]
*  Despite its success in mediating a brief ceasefire and hostage exchange in November of that year, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  its hosting of Hamas's political office has received criticism from some quarters. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=236.24s)]
*  It didn't stop us. It didn't hinder our effort. It made us more committed to achieve our objective [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  and our goal to bring the ceasefire and to bring peace to us and to bring the hostages back to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=247.52s)]
*  their families. We feel for both the same way. All of them, they are a human being. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=252.4s)]
*  Despite commitment from the negotiators, this is a fragile deal between two sworn enemies. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=258.16s)]
*  Is the guy that delayed the sign? No, he's, he's one of the, one of the parties involved [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=263.68s)]
*  in the negotiation. He's one of the parties involved in the negotiations. It was happening [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=270.64s)]
*  in Qatar. Okay. And, and the, the, the Qatari government has actively played a role. The [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=275.04s)]
*  Egyptian government has as well. They have a little bit more leeway in terms of, they have a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=283.12s)]
*  little bit more leeway in terms of like openly saying what's going on than Egypt does. I think [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=288.4s)]
*  at least from what I have seen, you know what I mean? This is something that I saw the thing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=293.76s)]
*  about democracy is sometimes you are not in the majority. And this is one of those times. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ey2ymX78O0&t=299.92s)]
