*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=117.0s)]
*  I got it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=118.0s)]
*  Look, I got a quick picture of you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=119.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=120.0s)]
*  He's like, he's like the... [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=121.0s)]
*  What's going on, man? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=122.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=123.0s)]
*  He used to go to a hotel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=124.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=125.0s)]
*  I think you guys are getting more... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=126.0s)]
*  It was f***ing crazy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=127.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems the guy just knocked you over. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=128.0s)]
*  We were two miles away, so we just ran through... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=129.0s)]
*  Or like... [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=130.0s)]
*  Oh, you didn't Uber at all. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=131.0s)]
*  Well, we did, but then there was... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=132.0s)]
*  I got the mic on it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=133.0s)]
*  My God. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=134.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go get it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=135.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go get it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=136.0s)]
*  I got the mic on it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=138.0s)]
*  My God. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=139.0s)]
*  Do you want a hot mic? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=140.0s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=141.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=142.0s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=143.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=144.0s)]
*  We're just waiting, I guess, for a song to go up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=149.0s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=150.0s)]
*  I guess everybody's seeing the full crowd coming through here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=151.0s)]
*  It's a massive crowd. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=153.0s)]
*  All the speakers, yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=154.0s)]
*  And then there's like, I don't know if... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, you can see on the news, but there's all the other protests, not really Palestine-related. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=156.0s)]
*  It's like the Japan's off NATO stuff. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=163.0s)]
*  People all over DC today on the metro. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=165.0s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=168.0s)]
*  It's totally wild. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=169.0s)]
*  But yeah, I'm kind of curious to see how this shakes out. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=171.0s)]
*  We're gonna march to the ICE headquarters, I believe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=178.0s)]
*  I think that's the goal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=180.0s)]
*  What they heard was the goal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=181.0s)]
*  And I saw you got arrested. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=182.0s)]
*  I have one. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=183.0s)]
*  I have one. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=184.0s)]
*  Oh, you have one. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=185.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that was... [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=186.0s)]
*  That was, I guess, about a month ago. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=187.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=191.0s)]
*  And an action at Trump Tower. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=193.0s)]
*  And the charges were dropped. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=194.0s)]
*  Nice, congrats. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=195.0s)]
*  Turns out that the cops didn't write the ticket properly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=196.0s)]
*  Is that really what happened? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=198.0s)]
*  That was what happened. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=199.0s)]
*  It turns out that on the tickets for us, they didn't write that we refused the order to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=200.0s)]
*  disperse. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=206.0s)]
*  So they just had like... [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=207.0s)]
*  Like they had just said, oh yeah, we told them to leave and they were making noise and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=208.0s)]
*  we arrested them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=214.0s)]
*  How many people did they arrest? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=215.0s)]
*  Like a hundred. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=216.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=217.0s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure everybody was entirely dismissed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=218.0s)]
*  No? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=220.0s)]
*  Oh, upside down? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=221.0s)]
*  Oh, this way. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=222.0s)]
*  I bet it's better now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=223.0s)]
*  But my dulcet tones are coming through. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=224.0s)]
*  But yeah, it was easy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=227.0s)]
*  I mean, it was like, it worked out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=230.0s)]
*  And I think I wouldn't be surprised if there were more actions like it coming up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=234.0s)]
*  Was it JVP? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was JVP. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=240.0s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're a well-oiled machine in New York City. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=242.0s)]
*  But now it's too close. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=246.0s)]
*  Let's go right here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=249.0s)]
*  I want to get the crowd. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=257.0s)]
*  All right, there we go. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=258.0s)]
*  Sorry, I was talking to local news? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=262.0s)]
*  No? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=266.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=267.0s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=272.0s)]
*  Is that Roneo... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=275.0s)]
*  That's Breakthrough News. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=276.0s)]
*  I think that's Roneo Pollard. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=277.0s)]
*  Roneo Pollard. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=278.0s)]
*  So they've had a lot of faith leaders up. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=283.0s)]
*  Head of American Muslims for Palestine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=286.0s)]
*  Head of CARE. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=288.0s)]
*  They just had somebody up from PSL. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=290.0s)]
*  Do you like PSL? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=295.0s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=296.0s)]
*  Do you like PSL? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=297.0s)]
*  They're great. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=298.0s)]
*  They're putting in the work. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=299.0s)]
*  They've put a lot of effort to get people in here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=300.0s)]
*  They put together the demo I was at at Union Square last weekend. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=303.0s)]
*  I know they put a lot of resources into getting people down here for this, which is tremendous. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=307.0s)]
*  When they did the November 2023 march, which was massive, massive march on the mall, they were part of the group for that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=313.0s)]
*  The coalition that's put these events together is really large. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=325.0s)]
*  It's very impressive. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=329.0s)]
*  You're Jewish, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=332.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=333.0s)]
*  We have that in common. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=334.0s)]
*  We do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=335.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=336.0s)]
*  What are the odds? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=337.0s)]
*  That's so wide. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=338.0s)]
*  From New York. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=339.0s)]
*  What? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=340.0s)]
*  I know, it's kind of crazy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=341.0s)]
*  And with the beard, the curly hair, what? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=342.0s)]
*  That is... [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=344.0s)]
*  You're pulling my leg. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=345.0s)]
*  And you're a Mets fan. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=347.0s)]
*  And I'm a Mets fan. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=348.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=350.0s)]
*  Wait, did Hassan ring my hat back? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=351.0s)]
*  Is it in your Nix? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=353.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's got it in the hotel. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=355.0s)]
*  Okay, perfect. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=357.0s)]
*  Yeah, I caused him grief with that Nix hat. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=360.0s)]
*  Oh, he's sealed that from you? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=362.0s)]
*  No, I left it at his house. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=364.0s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=366.0s)]
*  But... [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=367.0s)]
*  You should steal stuff from him. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=368.0s)]
*  I should steal stuff from him. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=369.0s)]
*  I mean, I do it all the time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=370.0s)]
*  I do it to most of my friends. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=371.0s)]
*  I think it's good to steal from them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=373.0s)]
*  It keeps them on their toes. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=375.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=376.0s)]
*  Also, he's not going to miss it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=377.0s)]
*  No, why would he? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=378.0s)]
*  Gosh. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=384.0s)]
*  I am curious to see what ends up... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=387.0s)]
*  Like, how it looks all taken... [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=390.0s)]
*  It always looks different from one place when it's a march. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=392.0s)]
*  It looks like a lot of people from here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=396.0s)]
*  And I mean, coming here, it was mobbed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=398.0s)]
*  I think while he's up there, I'll probably stand behind him. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=401.0s)]
*  Or I'll scream out. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=403.0s)]
*  That sounds wise. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=405.0s)]
*  To get a better idea. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=407.0s)]
*  I'll make sure to keep talking when he's talking. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=409.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=411.0s)]
*  So that nobody can hear him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=412.0s)]
*  I think that would be good. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=414.0s)]
*  I could just chew into the microphone. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=416.0s)]
*  We could hunt down the quake. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah, excuse me. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=419.0s)]
*  Some peanuts. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=420.0s)]
*  I think it's a ball game. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=421.0s)]
*  So, um... [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=432.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=433.0s)]
*  Is there been, like... [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=434.0s)]
*  I mean, where'd you guys... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=435.0s)]
*  So you guys were just streaming from the hotel room? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=436.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just got here this morning, and he was streaming from the hotel. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=438.0s)]
*  And then we just figured out how to get here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=442.0s)]
*  Did you come over this morning, or did you come over last? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=446.0s)]
*  I came last night. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=448.0s)]
*  We drove down to the hotel. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=449.0s)]
*  I came last night. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=450.0s)]
*  We drove down with a friend. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=451.0s)]
*  I stayed in Chevy Chase, and then we'll go back up tonight. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=452.0s)]
*  How'd you get on Amtrak? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=456.0s)]
*  I took Amtrak, yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=458.0s)]
*  It was just so easy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=459.0s)]
*  I love... [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=460.0s)]
*  No, it's how I did the last one. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=461.0s)]
*  It was just too short notice for me. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=462.0s)]
*  And, like... [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=464.0s)]
*  I got a free ride. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=466.0s)]
*  I'm happy with that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=467.0s)]
*  No, it's too... [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=470.0s)]
*  I mean, it is, yeah, too expensive. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=471.0s)]
*  But, uh... [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=475.0s)]
*  No, I'm, like... [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still just kind of bowled over. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=479.0s)]
*  We were worried. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=481.0s)]
*  Like, it wouldn't be a big turnout. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=482.0s)]
*  Just, like, everything else competing for people's attention. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=483.0s)]
*  But, no, this is tremendous. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=486.0s)]
*  Mark, you want to go over there? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=492.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=493.0s)]

*  I'm the photographer. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=506.0s)]

*  Well they made the post office into a Trump hotel. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=879.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=882.42s)]
*  The US being a part of this genocide, this is not about it being a colonial imperialist [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=883.42s)]
*  like the US. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=891.42s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=900.42s)]
*  There is no way for the world to normalize a genocide. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=901.42s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=908.42s)]
*  I just wanted to say hi. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=909.42s)]

*  Thanks for being here. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=911.42s)]
*  Today, unless the people of Gaza, unless Muslims, Palestinians, Arabs, brown people, the global [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=912.42s)]
*  South is dehumanized, demonized, denigrated to the south of the world. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=919.42s)]
*  Sorry, heading up to New York tomorrow? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=926.42s)]

*  You heading up to New York after this? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=928.42s)]

*  Three. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=939.42s)]
*  You can't do it? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=940.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=941.42s)]
*  I'm in Queens. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=942.42s)]
*  I'm in a Mets game. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=943.42s)]
*  Justify and celebrate the elimination of our leader. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=944.42s)]
*  Fake New Yorker. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=947.42s)]
*  Fake New Yorker because I'm going to see a New York baseball team. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=948.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=952.42s)]
*  I see how it is. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=953.42s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's in the pocket of Andrew Cuomo. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=955.42s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm in the pocket of Steve Cohen because I love my Mets. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=958.42s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=962.42s)]
*  Well, I'm in the pocket of Eric Adams. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=963.42s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=965.42s)]
*  It's an ambush interview against Zahran. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=967.42s)]
*  It's an ambush interview against Zahran with Eric. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=969.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'm the Turkish MIT agent sent to undermine his cause. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=972.42s)]
*  Erdogan sends his regards. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=979.42s)]
*  Well, I'll tell the Mets that you sent yours. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=983.42s)]
*  I feel like I'm not going to be able to follow this energy. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=988.42s)]
*  All of our PR team. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1015.42s)]
*  What? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1018.42s)]
*  Just bring it up. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1019.42s)]
*  Bring up what? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1020.42s)]
*  Just bring it up. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1021.42s)]
*  Bring what up? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1022.42s)]
*  Just bring it up. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1023.42s)]
*  Oh, elevate the energy. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1024.42s)]
*  This is the moment that we understand and recognize that the genocide and the war in Gaza is [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1025.42s)]
*  a war against human dignity. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1034.42s)]
*  And that is how you justify. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1037.42s)]
*  That's how you legitimize genocide and ethnic cleansing. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1062.42s)]
*  Our fight is not for a difference of opinion. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1068.42s)]
*  There's no two sides of the story. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1075.42s)]
*  There is nothing to campaign for. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1077.42s)]
*  We're not campaigning for political change. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1080.42s)]
*  We're not campaigning for people to see us as equal human beings. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1083.42s)]
*  We are campaigning to end the war in human dignity. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1088.42s)]
*  The people of Gaza are living example no matter how painful it is for us to see the sacrifices, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1093.42s)]
*  to see the pain, to see the genocide, to see our children, our men, our women, our elders [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1108.42s)]
*  being massacred in the streets. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1117.42s)]
*  Yes, we salute their sacrifices, but we also need to learn that the fight for human dignity, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1120.42s)]
*  the fight for freedom, the fight for justice is now free. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1129.42s)]
*  We need to stop being comfortable. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1134.42s)]
*  We cannot allow the genocide to continue because if this genocide continues in Gaza, we will [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1138.42s)]
*  be next. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1145.42s)]
*  I don't want to remind you that the genocide in Gaza is part and parcel of the legacy of [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1146.42s)]
*  this land. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1158.42s)]
*  It's part of the heritage of the American Empire. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1159.42s)]
*  It started in 1492 by committing genocide against millions of the natives all the way [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1163.42s)]
*  to enslaving black people all the way in the last century of throwing Japanese in concentration [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1172.42s)]
*  camps to shooting students in Kent State University in 1970. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1180.42s)]
*  You know what you're going to say? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1187.42s)]
*  I'm just going to freestyle. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1189.42s)]
*  Actually just make it up. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1191.42s)]
*  That's what I'm going to do. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1194.42s)]
*  I'm not even joking. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1196.42s)]
*  Because I feel like what is there more to say? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1198.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1204.42s)]
*  I think most of it has been said at this point. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1206.42s)]
*  It's the act that matters. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1209.42s)]
*  The American Empire is leading the war against human dignity. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1213.42s)]
*  I'm going to end by saying that we cannot go back to normal. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1221.42s)]
*  The Gaza is the battle between good and evil. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1228.42s)]
*  Netanyahu was right when he said this is a war between light and darkness. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1232.42s)]
*  We only get the sights mixed up. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1237.42s)]
*  This is a war between light and death. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1241.42s)]
*  Because if human beings are deprived of their human dignity, that will be massacred like we are seeing in Gaza. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1246.42s)]
*  And nobody will do something about it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1254.42s)]
*  Otherwise, the world will not be silenced. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1257.42s)]
*  Will not be silenced on the images and the footages of our children being shredded to pieces. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1262.42s)]
*  But they're okay with it. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1269.42s)]
*  Because our people are not seen as human beings. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1271.42s)]
*  They're not seen as people worthy of having the certainness of being equal human beings that must be respected. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1275.42s)]
*  Their political aspirations must be recognized. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1283.42s)]
*  On the contrary, they are seen below animals. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1286.42s)]
*  Because even animals will be treated better by the Western colonial thoughts. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1290.42s)]
*  Starting today, we must escalate. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1298.42s)]
*  Starting today, we must not be intimidated or silenced. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1302.42s)]
*  Because America... [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1307.42s)]
*  I'm going to end by saying that the student movements in the past 100 years have been facing crackdowns left and right. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1311.42s)]
*  This is not just a Trump administration problem as I mentioned before. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1320.42s)]
*  This is the heresy of this empire. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1324.42s)]
*  And unless we recognize that this empire is fighting against human dignity, that the greed is destroying the role, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1326.42s)]
*  that the state of Israel, that simple colonial project of Zionism, is not a state of an exception. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1334.42s)]
*  It's the state of normalcy in Western colonial powers. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1341.42s)]
*  And we must, we must, we must, and we must move forward. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1345.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1349.42s)]
*  Great speech, man. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1356.42s)]
*  I want you to welcome to the stage, Devin Sondpiper! [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1358.42s)]
*  That's going to be a hard one to follow, wow. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1372.42s)]
*  I love you too. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1377.42s)]
*  That's why I'm here today, to speak about love in some ways. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1380.42s)]
*  I feel so emboldened, so galvanized, seeing so many people out here, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1384.42s)]
*  demonstrating for a free Palestine. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1391.42s)]
*  Something that I never thought I would be able to see so many people out on the streets, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1401.42s)]
*  and even more at home, who recognize the cruelty and the inhumanity of the Zionist regime [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1407.42s)]
*  and the American government's unconditional support for Israel's genocide of the Palestinian population. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1416.42s)]
*  Now, I've spoken on this matter every single day, as have you, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1430.42s)]
*  so we've said everything that must be said a million times over. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1434.42s)]
*  So I'm going to keep it short this week, also because I didn't really prepare for a speech, I'm sorry. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1439.42s)]
*  What I want to say is this. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1447.42s)]
*  Right now, this Trump administration has severely escalated the erosion of civil liberties for all Americans. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1449.42s)]
*  Every single one of us. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1459.42s)]
*  You have people getting black-bagged in the street, disappeared for the crime of speaking the truth. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1462.42s)]
*  And that is precisely the reason why you demonstrating here matters. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1473.42s)]
*  We must never allow these fascists to take away our voice, even if people don't recognize, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1480.42s)]
*  even if people don't understand that one day they might be the ones who get black-bagged [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1493.42s)]
*  and sent to a slave labor colony in El Salvador without due process. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1498.42s)]
*  We will fight for them too. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1503.42s)]
*  Because every single day is the fundamental truth. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1510.42s)]
*  None of us are free until all of us are free. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1514.42s)]
*  So I want to end with that. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scSam9rFs6s&t=1523.42s)]
