*  Years in the other administration where they did nothing piece. They didn't understand what was happening [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  our approach is [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=188.1s)]
*  Basically common sense as I said so many of the things that we do based on common sense [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=190.42s)]
*  If you want peace you have to talk both sides [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=195.46s)]
*  As I discussed with Prime Minister [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  Stammer the next step we're making is toward a very achievable ceasefire [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=203.02s)]
*  we hope that that can happen quickly because [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=209.22s)]
*  Thousands of young people in this case, we're not talking about Americans. We're talking about Ukrainians and Russians are being killed every week [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=213.9s)]
*  thousands and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=221.82s)]
*  It's a rough battlefield. It's a flat piece of land and the only stops when it hits somebody and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=223.58s)]
*  this week I saw the reports and it's it's I don't even want to say what [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=229.74s)]
*  What they are but thousands of people young people young vibrant people died [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=235.66000000000003s)]
*  And we want to stop that senseless [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=240.94s)]
*  Should have never happened [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=243.82000000000002s)]
*  this will lay the groundwork for a long-term peace agreement that will return stability to Eastern Europe and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=245.3s)]
*  Hopefully ensure that such a terrible will never happen on Europe that matter anywhere again, it's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=251.38s)]
*  It's a horrible thing that's going on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=259.7s)]
*  The disaster in Ukraine shows exactly why it's so important for the United Kingdom and other NATO partners to make large [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  investments in their defense capabilities in many cases [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=270.02s)]

*  You've created a moment of tremendous opportunity to reach a historic peace deal a [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=462.08s)]
*  Deal in Ukraine and around the world [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=468.28s)]
*  That is the prize [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=471.64s)]
*  But we have to get it right [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=474.32s)]
*  There's a famous slogan in the United Kingdom from after the second world [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=476.0s)]
*  That is that we have to win the peace and that's what we must do now [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=480.88s)]

*  That Ukraine will help shape that was backed by strength to stop Putin coming back for more [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=512.36s)]

*  Because that is the only way that peace will last [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=530.54s)]
*  Mr. President in this new era [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=535.5799999999999s)]

*  And we believe it's not taking part that counts what counts is winning [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  If you don't win, you don't deliver [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=597.1800000000001s)]
*  And we're determined to deliver for the working people of Britain and America who want and deserve to see their lives improve [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=600.3800000000001s)]
*  To see their lives improve [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=608.9s)]
*  So we're both in a hurry to get things done and that's what the UK and US do when we work together [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=611.14s)]
*  We win and we get things done [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=618.66s)]
*  So we'll do what it takes to keep our people safe [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=622.14s)]
*  We'll also work together to deliver some big economic wins that can benefit us both [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=625.62s)]
*  We have a 1.5 trillion dollar invested in each other's economies [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=631.02s)]
*  Creating over 2.5 million jobs across both economies [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=636.34s)]
*  Our trading relationship is not just strong [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=640.54s)]
*  It's fair balanced and reciprocal [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=644.3s)]
*  We're leaders together in so many areas ranked one and two in the world as investment destinations [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=647.5s)]
*  one and two for universities [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=654.62s)]

*  And we're the only two Western countries with trillion dollar tech sectors leaders in AI [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=663.5400000000001s)]
*  And look we take a similar approach on this issue [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=670.0200000000001s)]
*  Instead of over regulating these new technologies. We're seizing the opportunities that they offer [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=673.58s)]
*  So we've decided to begin work on a new economic deal with advanced technology at its core [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=679.1400000000001s)]

*  Shaped the great technological innovations of the last century [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=689.18s)]

*  Artificial intelligence could cure cancer that could be a moonshot for our age [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=699.7s)]
*  And that's how we'll keep delivering for basically giving up on everything [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=705.78s)]
*  That's why these guys keep talking about like moonshot cancer research or whatever [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=709.98s)]
*  Like yeah, oh our collaborative efforts are gonna fucking bring about a cure for cancer. I promise this is this is [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=714.66s)]

*  Another handshake, okay, let's see here go ahead, please [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=773.58s)]
*  Earlier today you told me that you believe that foreign countries [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=782.6600000000001s)]
*  Pay tariffs, but Americans who are concerned about higher prices [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=788.26s)]
*  Believe as most people do that they're paid by consumers and importers when they import things into this country [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=792.7s)]
*  Can you explain? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=800.5400000000001s)]
*  How you came to this belief that foreign governments are paying tariffs? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=802.46s)]
*  for the prime minister did you discuss with President Trump his [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=808.0600000000001s)]
*  repeated statements of desire to annex Canada and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=812.86s)]
*  Has the king expressed any? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=817.6600000000001s)]
*  Concern over the president's apparent desire to remove one of his [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=820.7s)]
*  from his control [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=828.1800000000001s)]
*  So I'll go ahead the first part the tariffs are necessary because we've been treated very unfairly by [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=830.3000000000001s)]
*  Many many countries including our friends friend and foe [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=840.62s)]
*  But we've been treated very unfairly in trade [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=844.2600000000001s)]
*  Everyone's so unfair nobody's really ever seen before [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=847.9399999999999s)]
*  The global superpower everyone's so unfair to us even though we've dominated the world [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=852.46s)]
*  During my four years with the best economy in the history of our country [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=859.14s)]
*  one probably the best economy may be the best economy in the history of the world and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=862.3s)]
*  I had I use tariffs to even things up and in particular with China [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=867.18s)]
*  we took in hundreds of billions of dollars and we had no inflation and [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=872.96s)]
*  It's a myth. It's a myth that's put out there by foreign countries that really don't like paying tariffs and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=877.22s)]
*  Especially to even up so we've been treated badly by a lot [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=884.82s)]
*  We're using tariffs and I find and you just have to look at the numbers, but I find that it's not about inflation [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=888.22s)]
*  It's about fairness and the inflation [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=894.78s)]
*  For us has not existed and I don't think it's going to exist. We're gonna bring our car industry back [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=897.5s)]
*  We're gonna bring our chips back. We're gonna bring so many things back to our country including [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  pharmaceuticals and drugs [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=907.76s)]
*  And the thing that's gonna get us there is tariffs and I say often it's my favorite word in the dictionary [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=909.28s)]
*  But I always preface that by saying now because I got into a lot of trouble with the fake news where they say [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  That's not good. So I say God love [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  Family wife what number five on the list [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=925.64s)]
*  But I will tell you it's gonna make our country rich and it's going to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=929.28s)]
*  Stop us from being a laughingstock all over the world [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=934.0s)]
*  Because we have been taken advantage of like no country has ever been taken advantage of thank you very much and [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=937.72s)]
*  Look, we had a really good [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=944.08s)]

*  Exist we're the closest of nations and we had very good discussions today, but we did that's enough. Thank you [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=962.1999999999999s)]

*  Hi, Natasha Clark, hi BC. Yeah, why no answer to the Canada question deal with Britain, which we of course welcome [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=976.92s)]
*  President Obama once said Britain was at the back of the queue for that trade deal. Where are we now? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=982.6999999999999s)]
*  When do you think we'll go we're going to see that and Prime Minister the BBC is today admitted serious flaws over the recent Gaza coverage [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=986.54s)]
*  Suggestions of payments made to people linked to Hamas. Does the BBC BBC still have your trust? Thank you [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=993.62s)]
*  Well, they didn't do well with President Obama. He'd never got a [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=999.78s)]
*  Lot of things done and he didn't get a trade deal done. That was of any importance or magnitude. We have [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1003.74s)]
*  We've had great discussions on trade and I think we're gonna have a deal done rather quickly as quickly as it can be done [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1010.62s)]
*  We're gonna have something I think rather quickly we expect to do that. Okay [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1016.02s)]
*  On the BBC look I've been concerned about [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1021.18s)]
*  The program in question the Secretary of State had a meeting with the BBC [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1025.18s)]

*  Mr. President, do you support article 5 of the NATO treaty and are you concerned that it might be triggered if European peacekeeping? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1037.82s)]
*  forces end up in Ukraine, I support it. I don't think we're gonna have any reason for it [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1044.78s)]
*  I think we're going to have you doing okay, man. No peace. I don't think anyone is doing okay [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1049.1s)]
*  it's gonna be a long-lasting piece and [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1054.02s)]
*  I think it's gonna happen. Hopefully quickly it if it doesn't happen quickly, it may not happen at all and [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1056.82s)]
*  We want it for two reasons number one. I want to see on a humane basis [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1063.94s)]

*  But it's largely that and I don't want to pay billions and billions and billions of dollars [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1075.5s)]
*  Nor does the Prime Minister or anybody else on a senseless war that should have never happened and we're gonna get it [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1080.5s)]
*  Taken care, but I think it's gonna be a piece that's gonna be long-lasting [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1086.66s)]
*  Do you have a question for the Prime Minister? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1090.18s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister you were asking the President today about a backstop for Europe if the peacekeeping force ends up in Ukraine [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1094.18s)]
*  Did you feel like you got a satisfying answer for yourself and for Europe and Mr. President if you want to comment on that as well, please do [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1102.18s)]
*  I thought we had a very productive discussion obviously as the President says the deal has to come first [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1109.18s)]
*  But yes, our teams are going to be talking about [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1118.18s)]
*  How we make sure that deal sticks is lasting and enforced so our teams will be talking about that [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1122.18s)]
*  Okay, please blue [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1131.18s)]

*  How much of the US expect to receive and when do you expect to see that come to fruition? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1142.18s)]
*  Well, we're never gonna know that answer but by our being in Ukraine and doing the exploration and also the digging and taking [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1148.18s)]
*  The rare earth which we need in our country very badly [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1157.18s)]

*  Tomorrow you're seeing president Zelensky to sign this deal on minerals and energy that could be hugely important to the United States [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1216.18s)]
*  Will you take the opportunity to apologize to him for calling him a dictator Vladimir Putin drama? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1227.18s)]
*  Well, let me start by saying I've been really clear today [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1235.18s)]
*  I guess like this is the only type of fucking response. We're gonna get a kingdom need to step up Trump [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1239.18s)]

*  I think you know, it's funny [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1252.18s)]
*  I'm gonna go along with the Krasnov Trump is a KGB agent memes because like the most extensive [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1254.18s)]
*  Mineral maps on Ukraine come from the USSR [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1259.18s)]
*  Okay, like USSR surveys [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1263.18s)]
*  So maybe they gave it to him in the fucking 80s as the as the KGB asset that he was and that's why he's like I need I am Krasnov sleeper cell for USSR [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1266.18s)]
*  I need to I need access the USSR mineral map. I have USSR mineral map of Ukraine in my in my penthouse [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1278.18s)]
*  I know there is rare earth mineral be a lasting deal and coming out of this our teams will now be talking in detail about that [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1289.18s)]
*  And I think we're gonna have a very good meeting tomorrow 11 o'clock. I like that [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1300.18s)]

*  I have a lot of respect for him [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1310.18s)]
*  We've given him a lot of equipment and a lot of money [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1313.18s)]
*  But they have fought very bravely no matter how you figure they have really fought somebody has to use that equipment and they have been very brave in that sense [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1316.18s)]
*  Yeah, please. Good [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1324.18s)]
*  No answer to the dictator things being some worry that face to you might never get there [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1332.18s)]
*  Do you believe that face to you of the ceasefire in Gaza will come to fruition and have you spoken to Netanyahu about it? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1336.18s)]
*  And for the Prime Minister this peacekeeping deal has been pushed forward by the UK and France as well [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1342.18s)]
*  Have you been in discussions with any other European countries to join this in this initiative? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1348.18s)]
*  And are you expecting Commonwealth countries to also join the efforts? Thank you [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1353.18s)]
*  So we're working very hard in the Middle East and Gaza and all of the problems and it's been going on for years and working very hard [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1357.18s)]
*  That's why he made the AI video he posted a video but it could be a very beautiful neighborhood [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1365.18s)]
*  And I think we're gonna come up with some pretty good solutions, but [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1370.18s)]
*  Phase one is almost complete [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1376.18s)]
*  We've had some people that have been very seriously injured very seriously hurt both physically and mentally [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1379.18s)]
*  They've come out of there very very in some of them in very very bad shape [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1386.18s)]
*  Very bad shape is shocking many young people young people aren't in bad shape young people are strong healthy [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1390.18s)]
*  They don't die people have come out dead young people and old people [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1398.18s)]
*  It's a rough situation, but I think we're gonna make it much better [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1404.18s)]
*  And I think that we've had a huge impact on that since we've been in just the four weeks [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1407.18s)]
*  I think we've had a huge impact on Gaza the Middle East and we have some pretty good [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1412.18s)]
*  Talks going on concerning lots of other people that are gonna make it better, so we'll see what happens [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1417.18s)]
*  Nobody really knows but we'll see what happens, but I think we've had a very positive impact [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1422.78s)]
*  Yeah on the question of oh, yeah, very very positive [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1427.5800000000002s)]
*  European countries yes, I've spoken to a number of countries [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1431.78s)]
*  Particularly in the last few weeks. We had a meeting in Paris [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1435.66s)]
*  Last week I've got a meeting on Sunday with 18 countries [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1438.66s)]
*  To further our discussions [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1443.22s)]
*  Quite intensely to our French take a peek on the other side and to see what the fuck is going on their countries as well [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1447.22s)]
*  Because as I say I think it's important for European countries including the United Kingdom [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1455.3000000000002s)]
*  To step up and do more in the defense and security of Europe and our continent in the United Kingdom [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1462.42s)]
*  Will do so well we're talking to a number of other countries [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1469.6599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Yes in the rear is awful. So wasted time for a whole month understandable [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1473.4199999999998s)]
*  Kamala version 2 go ahead [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1478.26s)]
*  Number one is if you're not considering the security guarantees of for example intelligence [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1483.9399999999998s)]
*  Cooperation with Ukraine and mr. Prime Minister. I didn't think they'd be pro-israel, but [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1491.8999999999999s)]
*  Does this fit into the two-state solution that the UK? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1497.9s)]
*  I didn't know as we watch this off to it. Yes as mingle is literally the largest political content creator on this platform [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1502.18s)]
*  Yeah, thank you very much. We're open to many things [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1508.82s)]
*  But before I even think about that that's almost pleasant to think about because that would mean that peace has been arrived at [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1510.78s)]
*  we have to arrive at that piece and [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1518.34s)]
*  You know you went three and a half years with an administration that never even really had a meeting [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1521.78s)]
*  they didn't have a meeting on peace and [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1526.74s)]
*  There was no prospect of peace. I think [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1529.86s)]
*  Frankly Russia wanted to go through the whole [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1532.74s)]
*  Long deal. I don't think they do anymore. I don't think they do we had a very big impact on that whole [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1535.26s)]
*  situation [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1542.02s)]
*  but I [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1543.5s)]
*  Don't like talking about phase two until I get phase one phase one is after make peace [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1545.14s)]
*  What we have to get Russia to agree we have to get [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1550.34s)]
*  Ukraine to agree and I think we will I think we've come a long way I [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1553.38s)]
*  Believe we're going to get it done. I wouldn't say that if I didn't think so and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1558.26s)]
*  I think it will be very important very historic and we're going to save a lot of a lot of lives [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1563.22s)]
*  On the question of Gaza the last few weeks of the ceasefire [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1570.78s)]
*  Have been very impactful and for me there are two images that I remember more than any other [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1576.54s)]
*  The first is Emily Demare [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1582.74s)]
*  Who is British being reunited with her mother you may remember she had her fingers [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1585.34s)]
*  Missing after what she endured that was an incredible moment [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1591.78s)]
*  I'd spent a lot of time with her mother while she was held captive and her mother went through absolute torture [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1596.02s)]
*  The other image was thousands of Palestinians marching through rubble trying to return to their communities and their homes [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1603.66s)]
*  So we have to do everything we can to ensure that the ceasefire continues so that more hostages can be [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1611.1000000000001s)]
*  Returned so that aid can be brought in that's desperately needed [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1617.94s)]
*  and [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1622.78s)]
*  We need to allow [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1624.1000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians to return and to rebuild their lives and we must all support them in doing that and yes [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1625.94s)]
*  I believe that the two-state solution is ultimately the only way for a lasting [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1630.9s)]
*  peace in the region [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1636.98s)]
*  And think of that she came home with her fingers and part of her hand blown off. That's terrible [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1639.46s)]
*  How bad does he get and we had others that came home in much much worse shape than that [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1646.94s)]
*  It's a terrible situation [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1653.1s)]
*  Please yes, Starmers a public reading a message you received on his phone Lamar. He says that in front of Trump yet imprisons anyone [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1655.54s)]
*  Persuade you not to put tariffs on the UK and if I may Prime Minister [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1663.94s)]
*  Do you know interest in like actually what the fuck these guys are saying and everything in everything is about the aesthetics [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1669.14s)]
*  I feel like for these guys. They're just like hyper focusing on Keir Stalin saying a lot [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1676.06s)]
*  Or being fake and phony pay him over there [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1681.34s)]
*  But he tried we I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great friendly countries [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1684.42s)]
*  I think we we could very well end up with a real trade deal [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1691.68s)]
*  Where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1695.5200000000002s)]
*  We'll see but he's [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1699.5200000000002s)]
*  He earned whatever they whatever they pay him here and today he was working hard at lunch and and I'm very receptive to it [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1701.92s)]
*  I think we in all fairness in all serious. I think we have a very good chance at arriving in a very good deal JD and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1708.88s)]
*  Scott [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1715.6000000000001s)]
*  Howard all the people are working on it and I think we have a good chance at arriving at a deal that could be [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1717.72s)]
*  Terrific really terrific for both countries. Okay. Thank you on the second part of the question [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1723.88s)]
*  I think my views on Putin are pretty well rehearsed and pretty well known [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1729.5s)]
*  And my concern is that if there's a deal and I hope there is a deal that it must be a lasting deal [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1734.88s)]
*  That it's not a temporary measure and that is [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1741.48s)]
*  why I think it's really important that [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1745.0s)]
*  I think we'll have two deals. I think we'll have a deal on ending the war and I think we're gonna end up with a great [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1747.0s)]
*  Trade deal with you and it's an honor to be with you and I want to thank everybody very much [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1752.72s)]
*  Thank you very much [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1757.7s)]
*  I [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1764.42s)]
*  Think that the deal is the deal that is going to be one of the most important things that we've seen in the past [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1768.4s)]
*  And I want to thank everybody very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1773.0s)]
*  Three handshakes, baby. Three of them. Kids starver got the triple handshake. Art of the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1776.36s)]
*  deal, baby. All right. Another deal. Yeah. I mean, I, I often find myself knowing less [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1783.92s)]
*  like learning less about where America is most likely going to go in terms of foreign [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1793.88s)]
*  policy after it is truly unique. The way that these guys can get up there and say so much [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1799.88s)]
*  and, and virtually say nothing. Like it is wild. Every, I feel like every time I hear a Trump press [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1809.0s)]
*  conference, I'm like, I'm more confused than before the press conference started. You know, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1815.88s)]
*  maybe I'm losing my, maybe I'm losing my critical thinking skills. I don't know, but it's just like, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1822.0400000000002s)]
*  it truly feels as though they're saying a lot and saying nothing at all. At the same time, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1827.88s)]
*  it seems like they're saying a lot, but they're actually saying nothing at all. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  But seemingly the reason why I also like to look at what like a Asmongold's chat is saying in this [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1839.96s)]
*  situation, because he's the largest content creator on this platform and has a massive [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1846.0400000000002s)]
*  community of people who are seemingly tuning in to, to get some right-wing commentary. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6wR01gF3Q&t=1850.8400000000001s)]
