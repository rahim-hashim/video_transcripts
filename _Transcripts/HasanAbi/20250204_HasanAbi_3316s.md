*  I think this is just for the fact that it's white. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=25.52s)]
*  It's white. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=27.8s)]

*  I live in a very good portfolio. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=609.46s)]
*  I love Jersey. He's a Jersey boy too. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=611.46s)]
*  Yeah? Yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=613.46s)]
*  He doesn't like to say it though, but he's a Jersey boy. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=615.46s)]
*  He's denying his heritage. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=617.46s)]
*  Chad, I did not grow up in Montclair. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=622.46s)]
*  People think Montclair, they think Ritzy. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=625.46s)]
*  It wasn't like that for me. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=628.46s)]
*  How do you go through his animals? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=630.46s)]
*  My house had six bedrooms, nine baths. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=632.46s)]
*  Alright, where can we place the camera you think? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=635.46s)]
*  I mean, best bet would... [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=638.46s)]
*  This is a little too close to be a good angle. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=640.46s)]
*  And these are a little too low for using this. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=643.46s)]
*  Why don't you put a table like this? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=645.46s)]
*  That'll probably work best. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=647.46s)]
*  But honestly, what I think we should probably do is use this small table as our table. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=650.46s)]
*  And use this as a stand because it's just taller. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=654.46s)]
*  Well, this is important. You're about to try the best strawberry in the world. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=656.46s)]
*  I could also potentially put this barrel on top of that table. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=660.46s)]
*  I could just hold the camera. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=663.46s)]
*  I could just hold it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=665.46s)]
*  No, I mean, if someone's going to hold it, I'll hold it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=667.46s)]
*  I feel like this has got to be cinematic almost. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=669.46s)]
*  You're about to try some of the most delicate, beautiful fruits in the world. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=672.46s)]
*  You got to make this special. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=676.46s)]
*  Oh, here. Let's do this. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=678.46s)]
*  Put it on top of the barrel? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=680.46s)]
*  Put the barrel on top of the desk? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=682.46s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=684.46s)]
*  You know what's crazy? Did you re-chat for that? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=690.46s)]
*  What? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=693.46s)]
*  Wait, did you re-chat when saying that I'm doing that? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=694.46s)]
*  I don't have chat. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=696.46s)]
*  Marsh said the same thing in chat. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=697.46s)]
*  He said barrel on table. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=700.46s)]
*  Me and Marsh do this everywhere we go. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=702.46s)]
*  I feel bad for Marsh. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=705.46s)]
*  Why? He has the greatest life of all time. What are you talking about? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=707.46s)]
*  It's good. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=712.46s)]
*  How long have you known each other? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=713.46s)]
*  Like five years, I think. Four years. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=717.46s)]
*  Sure, you treat your employees well. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=721.46s)]
*  Bro, he's not an employee. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=724.46s)]
*  Wait, I'm flipping so I can see it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=728.46s)]
*  He's literally a co-owner. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=731.46s)]
*  Of your days. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=734.46s)]
*  Of your end. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=736.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. I know that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=737.46s)]
*  But that's what I mean. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=738.46s)]
*  Does he work for you on other stuff, too? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=739.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we do stuff together from time to time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=740.46s)]
*  See, you know who is my co-owner? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=745.46s)]
*  You got him, who's a well-educated guy that can do stuff. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=747.46s)]
*  I got Canute. That's my co-owner. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=751.46s)]
*  I f***ed up. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=755.46s)]
*  I f***ed up. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=756.46s)]
*  I got Canute Delman. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=760.46s)]
*  You have Canute to be there. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=763.46s)]
*  He's on my... [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=765.46s)]
*  Who f***ed up? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=767.46s)]
*  You... [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=768.46s)]
*  What? Oh. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=769.46s)]
*  Who f***ed up? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=775.46s)]
*  Me. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=777.46s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=778.46s)]
*  Okay, great. So you have your chopping board, your forks, your knife. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=779.46s)]
*  Are you finishing his kebab? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=785.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=787.46s)]
*  Dude. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=789.46s)]
*  I'm full now. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=790.46s)]
*  Got you. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=791.46s)]
*  So you're normal with basic juices? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=793.46s)]
*  Nah, I'm in Texas and I hate it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=794.46s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=796.46s)]
*  Nah, I hate it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=797.46s)]
*  So why are you in Texas? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=798.46s)]
*  Well, Texas loves you. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=801.46s)]
*  There was a guy named Soda Poppin, big streamer. I moved there for him. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=802.46s)]
*  That was like six years ago. I'm over it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=807.46s)]
*  I might move in with him. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=810.46s)]
*  Damn. That was a big statement. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=813.46s)]
*  Hey, things are moving really fast. I'm just not sure. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=817.46s)]
*  Yeah, I never say yes to... [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=819.46s)]
*  Let's take your time. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=821.46s)]
*  I don't know where he's coming from. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=822.46s)]
*  Let's take time and space. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=823.46s)]
*  I, uh, yeah, I don't know. I just hate Texas. It's boring. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=824.46s)]
*  Well, you can make it fun. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=829.46s)]
*  I try, but there's traffic everywhere. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=832.46s)]
*  So that's why I listen to a lot of EDM. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=835.46s)]
*  Oh, it's blurry. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=837.46s)]
*  Is that a horse? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=839.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's Texas. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=840.46s)]
*  My ex did that. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=841.46s)]
*  Right in front of a horse, you know. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=842.46s)]
*  Might, might well. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=843.46s)]
*  Might, yeah. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=844.46s)]
*  It may be that guy. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=846.46s)]
*  Maybe a... [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=847.46s)]
*  And you can move it a little bit more, too. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=849.46s)]
*  Nah, I'm more of a Jersey boy. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=852.46s)]
*  Jersey, Jersey. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=855.46s)]
*  So it's like centered, you know? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=856.46s)]
*  It's the focus mode on this. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=857.46s)]
*  Oh, no, no, hold on. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=858.46s)]
*  I love Miami. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=859.46s)]
*  This is how you... well, it's the tweak. Yeah, on the lens. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=860.46s)]
*  I always said I will never live in Miami. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=862.46s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=864.46s)]
*  I love Miami. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=865.46s)]
*  You see it? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=866.46s)]
*  Not Miami, I'm sorry. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=867.46s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=868.46s)]
*  It's f***ing interesting. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=869.46s)]
*  It should be big. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=870.46s)]
*  I think it might be on auto-focus, too. Maybe focusing on the boxes. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=871.46s)]
*  That might be it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=875.46s)]
*  No, it's on manual focus. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=878.46s)]
*  I'm gonna switch to auto. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=879.46s)]
*  We should just start streaming together. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=883.46s)]
*  What? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=885.46s)]
*  Stream together. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=886.46s)]
*  What's that? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=887.46s)]
*  The thing where you see, like, I could technically be streaming right now. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=888.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=891.46s)]
*  We should just do that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=892.46s)]
*  You just didn't suggest it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=894.46s)]
*  I don't know how to do it from this, though. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=895.46s)]
*  No, neither. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=897.46s)]
*  Then why are you suggesting? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=898.46s)]
*  This is actually cool. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=899.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's nice. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=901.46s)]
*  Okay, I think this is good. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=903.46s)]
*  The way you said that, it's like, yeah, it's nice. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=906.46s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=908.46s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=909.46s)]
*  No, it is. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=910.46s)]
*  It's sick. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=911.46s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=912.46s)]
*  Today, we're gonna be doing something very special. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=914.46s)]
*  For those of you who don't know, Japan is famous for perfection and many other things, maybe some war crimes. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=917.46s)]
*  But also, in terms of perfection, the one thing that Japanese people absolutely love are fruits. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=925.46s)]
*  And today, we went to one of the greatest fruit purveyors, the Fruits and Parlor in Shibuya, to go and purchase the most expensive melon. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=935.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, it did not have the square watermelon because it's not in season. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=951.46s)]
*  And also, the most expensive strawberries on the planet. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=954.46s)]
*  Now, you guys probably remember, it was actually yesterday when we went and purchased these goods, these wares. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=958.46s)]
*  But I don't really remember what the price is. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=964.46s)]
*  I'm sure you guys remember what the prices are. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=967.46s)]
*  They said that it was okay if it's like two days. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=969.46s)]
*  It could just like stay for two days. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=972.46s)]
*  Okay? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=974.46s)]
*  And I kept it in a cool area. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=975.46s)]
*  The strawberries were $12 each. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=976.46s)]
*  The strawberries were $12 each. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=977.46s)]
*  We also have something from the kitchen. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=980.46s)]
*  These are dried, freeze-dried strawberries with chocolate. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=983.46s)]
*  We can start off with those actually. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=986.46s)]
*  But today, I got some friends with me and we're gonna test out if the expensive Japanese fruits, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=988.46s)]
*  are actually worth all of the hype and also the money. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=993.46s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=999.46s)]
*  Starting off with the freeze-dried strawberry chocolate thing. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1000.46s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1006.46s)]
*  You should do it on the count of three. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1008.46s)]
*  Smell it first. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1011.46s)]
*  Where's the chocolate? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1012.46s)]
*  That's what you always need to do, smell it first. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1013.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1015.46s)]
*  Wait, what the fuck? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1016.46s)]
*  It's a soap pack. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1017.46s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1018.46s)]

*  Oh, wow. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1027.46s)]
*  Oh, it smells like chocolate. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1028.46s)]
*  It smells like chocolate. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1029.46s)]
*  It smells like a strawberry Nesquik. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1031.46s)]
*  All right, put it on. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1033.46s)]
*  Here, Ryan, do you want to pull that chair up over here? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1034.46s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1037.46s)]
*  What the fuck might eat it? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1041.46s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1045.46s)]
*  My brain is not registering what I'm eating in my mouth. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1047.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1050.46s)]
*  It's very soft. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1051.46s)]
*  Texturally, it is a chocolate. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1053.46s)]
*  But I'm eating a strawberry. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1056.46s)]
*  Yeah, that tastes like a strawberry Nesquik to go. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1061.46s)]
*  That was a... [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1064.46s)]
*  No, what did they do to it? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1065.46s)]
*  That's a strawberry Nesquik. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1067.46s)]
*  No, no, what did they... [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1068.46s)]
*  Explain the science. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1070.46s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1072.46s)]
*  It was freeze-dried strawberries. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1073.46s)]
*  I think it's pretty soft. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1075.46s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1079.46s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1080.46s)]
*  This is the number one. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1081.46s)]
*  We also, on top of the melon and the strawberries, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1083.46s)]
*  we have the number one apple. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1087.46s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1089.46s)]
*  And also... [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1091.46s)]
*  That's a big apple. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1093.46s)]
*  Professor. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1094.46s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1095.46s)]
*  This is literally the number one apple in Japan. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1097.46s)]
*  And also, these massive grapes. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1100.46s)]
*  I think they're grapes, but I can't even tell. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1104.46s)]
*  It looks like my head. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1106.46s)]
*  Looks like someone's... [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1107.46s)]
*  Look at how big these grapes are. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1108.46s)]
*  Wait, it's still stuck on the Nesquik. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1109.46s)]
*  Look at my balls. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1110.46s)]
*  All right, here. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1112.46s)]
*  No, I feel like we're just bullying past that. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1113.46s)]
*  That was weird. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1115.46s)]
*  Tasty. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1116.46s)]
*  I mean, you have it in your hands. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1117.46s)]
*  So... [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1118.46s)]
*  I'm not putting anything in my hands. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1120.46s)]
*  Why are you coming in? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1121.46s)]
*  What? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1122.46s)]
*  It looks better like this. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1123.46s)]
*  You didn't like the angle? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1124.46s)]
*  No, yeah, this is better. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1125.46s)]
*  Check both. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1126.46s)]

*  I mean... [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1134.46s)]
*  All right, I pulled off the top. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1136.46s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1138.46s)]

*  Kanpai. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1143.46s)]
*  Oh my God, that's meaty. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1149.46s)]
*  That's a grape. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1152.46s)]
*  That's a meaty-ass grape. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1153.46s)]
*  That's a f***ing grape. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1154.46s)]
*  I'll be the first to say, that was just a grape. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1157.46s)]
*  Yeah, that was a grape. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1160.46s)]
*  That was a big grape. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1161.46s)]
*  A very, very large grape. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1162.46s)]
*  A powerful big grape. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1164.46s)]
*  That was a grape. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1165.46s)]
*  That was a grape. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1166.46s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't... [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1168.46s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't feel particularly crazy. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1170.46s)]
*  I like the purple going on. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1174.46s)]
*  So you're saying it wasn't grape? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1175.46s)]
*  No, it wasn't grape. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1177.46s)]
*  I prefer purple grapes. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1178.46s)]
*  That's a weird opinion. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1180.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1182.46s)]

*  Okay. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1184.46s)]
*  I like green grapes. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1185.46s)]
*  Let's bust open. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1186.46s)]
*  You have the Ecuador banana, too, that you bought yesterday. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1187.46s)]
*  But before we get to that, I'm going to bust open the biggest... [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1190.46s)]
*  This is the most expensive apple in Japan. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1193.46s)]
*  I forget how much this was, but I think it was like 20 bucks or something. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1196.46s)]
*  No, it was more than that. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1199.46s)]
*  No, that was the strawberry price. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1201.46s)]
*  How do you open these? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1203.46s)]
*  Rip it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1204.46s)]
*  Oh, I got it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1208.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1210.46s)]
*  You want to cut it? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1212.46s)]
*  You want to do the honors? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1213.46s)]
*  It comes with this weird styrofoam at the top of it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1214.46s)]
*  Whoa, whoa. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1216.46s)]
*  Let me move out of the way first. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1218.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1219.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1220.46s)]
*  That was not even cut. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1221.46s)]
*  Why did you cut it like that? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1223.46s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1224.46s)]
*  Dude, just... [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1225.46s)]
*  Let the woman handle it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1226.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1227.46s)]
*  Let the woman handle it, okay? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1228.46s)]
*  I don't know why you cut it like that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1229.46s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1231.46s)]
*  What? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1232.46s)]
*  What were the motor skills you just have to look like? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1233.46s)]
*  That was... [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1235.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1236.46s)]
*  I was just picking up a look. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1237.46s)]
*  That's enjoy. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1240.46s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1251.46s)]
*  It's... [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1254.46s)]
*  Wait. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1255.46s)]
*  Smells... [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1256.46s)]
*  This is... [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1258.46s)]
*  It's very powerful. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1259.46s)]
*  Is this considered the world's best apple? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1260.46s)]
*  It smells kind of like a Fuji apple. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1261.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's the most expensive one. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1262.46s)]
*  It was the most expensive one at the store. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1264.46s)]
*  It's got a powerful scent to it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1267.46s)]
*  The most expensive apple in the world. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1269.46s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1271.46s)]

*  Let's see. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1274.46s)]
*  Kanpai. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1275.46s)]
*  No, I hate it. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1277.46s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1278.46s)]
*  It's really soft. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1279.46s)]
*  It's mealy. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1280.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1281.46s)]
*  Finish it. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1282.46s)]
*  It's actually a nightmare. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1283.46s)]
*  The inside of it is not... [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1284.46s)]
*  That tastes like IKEA furniture. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1287.46s)]
*  The shell of it is definitely very hard. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1289.46s)]
*  It might be worse. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1292.46s)]
*  The shell of it is definitely hard, but the inside of it is too soft. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1293.46s)]
*  It's like granules. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1296.46s)]
*  It almost melts in your mouth and turns into like... [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1298.46s)]
*  What is the apple thing that children and old people drink? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1301.46s)]
*  Apple sauce. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1304.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's like mealy and... [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1305.46s)]
*  Not very moist. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1308.46s)]
*  There's no juice to it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1309.46s)]
*  Okay, I have to step away from the banana. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1311.46s)]
*  Okay, but I'm going to say this. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1312.46s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1313.46s)]
*  I'm afraid of bananas. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1314.46s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1315.46s)]
*  You're afraid of bananas? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1316.46s)]
*  That's why she did the smokey part. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1317.46s)]
*  I'm pretty cool, but the raw bananas and the idea of opening them and eating them get really scammy. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1318.46s)]
*  I think I was a tortured monkey in a past life, so that's my reasoning. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1326.46s)]
*  You guys can take this away. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1331.46s)]
*  This is an Ecuador banana. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1332.46s)]
*  I'm not sure what the significance of Ecuador is in terms of like... [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1335.46s)]
*  Wait, but it's on. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1338.46s)]
*  So I think the apple sucks, but if you bite into it, it's pretty fun because it's so big. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1339.46s)]
*  You bite into it. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1345.46s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1346.46s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1347.46s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1348.46s)]
*  Oh, you bit into it already? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1349.46s)]
*  Bite the other side. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1351.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1352.46s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1353.46s)]

*  No. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1355.46s)]
*  It's not better. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1356.46s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1357.46s)]
*  It's like... [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1358.46s)]
*  Oh. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1359.46s)]
*  Yeah, that can't be better. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1360.46s)]
*  It definitely tastes like a banana. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1361.46s)]
*  Yeah, that can't be better. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1363.46s)]
*  It definitely falls apart like super quick. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1364.46s)]
*  Do you eat bananas or no? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1370.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1372.46s)]

*  Yeah, right. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1374.46s)]
*  If it's blended in a smoothie or if it's cooked in a cake, maybe. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1375.46s)]
*  All right, let's see. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1380.46s)]

*  It's definitely a good banana. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1402.46s)]
*  I'm not going to lie to you. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1403.46s)]
*  If these last two fruits that we're about to try are not like 10 out of 10 bangers, I am [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1404.46s)]

*  The only thing that blew my mind was whatever the fuck's going on in those strawberries. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1418.46s)]
*  Or maybe we just got like super scum-a's. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1420.46s)]

*  talk to him. You can eat it. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1548.46s)]
*  He said like two days. It'll stay for two days. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1550.46s)]
*  No, he meant eat it in two days. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1552.46s)]
*  Are we eating it too fast? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1554.46s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1556.46s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1558.46s)]
*  That's definitely what she said. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1560.46s)]
*  Are we eating it too fast? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1562.46s)]
*  Sometimes you do, you know. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1564.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1566.46s)]
*  Oh, you can explore. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1568.46s)]
*  Okay, dude, that banana's actually kind of a problem. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1570.46s)]
*  I will say this. This is the best, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1572.46s)]
*  one of the best bananas I ever had. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1574.46s)]
*  It's still a banana. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1576.46s)]
*  It's not so good that I would ever go out of my way to get this. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1578.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm good. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1580.46s)]
*  You want to eat the banana? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1582.46s)]
*  It's a very good banana. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1584.46s)]
*  I've never cut a melon before. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1586.46s)]
*  I assume you just do it like this? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1588.46s)]
*  Half way? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1590.46s)]
*  There you go. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1592.46s)]
*  You gotta look at it when you do that. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1594.46s)]
*  That's so juicy. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1596.46s)]
*  Really juicy. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1598.46s)]
*  So you can scoop out the innards [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1600.46s)]
*  with the fork, maybe? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1602.46s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1604.46s)]
*  And then you can slice it. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1606.46s)]
*  This is a crazy honeydew. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1608.46s)]
*  Oh, it's so soft. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1610.46s)]
*  It's so soft. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1612.46s)]
*  Oh my god, look at that juice. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1614.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1616.46s)]
*  Grow up. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1618.46s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1620.46s)]
*  It's gaping. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1622.46s)]
*  Damn it. Get off. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1628.46s)]
*  If I didn't eat my grape, I would throw it at you right now. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1630.46s)]
*  Mugs. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1632.46s)]
*  Damn. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1636.46s)]
*  I've never had a melon before. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1638.46s)]
*  I've had maybe once or twice. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1640.46s)]
*  Wait, you've never had melon? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1642.46s)]
*  No, I've never been a fan of melon. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1644.46s)]
*  I'm more of a watermelon fan. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1646.46s)]
*  What do you do at a hotel breakfast, bro? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1648.46s)]
*  It's just honeydew and cantaloupe. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1650.46s)]
*  I don't eat fruit that much anyway. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1652.46s)]
*  I never really eat fruit. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1654.46s)]
*  There's a couple pieces left in there, but whatever. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1656.46s)]
*  Should we just dive in [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1660.46s)]
*  with the forks? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1662.46s)]
*  Just slice it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1664.46s)]
*  Cut it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1666.46s)]
*  Ryan, you take that over. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1668.46s)]
*  Look at this. It's so soft. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1670.46s)]
*  This melon was $100. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1672.46s)]
*  Let's try the men's way. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1674.46s)]
*  I can already tell I'm not going to like it. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1676.46s)]
*  You're not going to like it? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1678.46s)]
*  I like a melon that's firm. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1680.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a jugular thing. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1682.46s)]
*  Wait, where are you? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1686.46s)]
*  I'm just giving you an example of how to actually eat a melon. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1688.46s)]
*  Here we can put alcohol and you can drink it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1692.46s)]
*  This is what they do in Argentina. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1694.46s)]
*  There you go. Now you have four slices. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1700.46s)]
*  The Argentina special [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1704.46s)]
*  in the melon. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1706.46s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1708.46s)]
*  The best melon in the world. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1710.46s)]
*  This was a very good presentation. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1712.46s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1714.46s)]
*  That was pretty good. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1720.46s)]
*  Is it really good? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1722.46s)]
*  To be fair, I don't know what to judge it against [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1724.46s)]
*  because I've never really had a melon before. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1726.46s)]
*  As a honeydew fan, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1728.46s)]
*  this is [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1730.46s)]
*  texturally, it's not great, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1732.46s)]
*  but it is incredibly bright [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1734.46s)]
*  and almost more acidic than most honeydew I've had. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1736.46s)]
*  The juice is very sweet and bright. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1740.46s)]
*  Is it worth $100? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1742.46s)]
*  No fucking no. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1744.46s)]
*  You paid $100 for that? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1746.46s)]
*  Yeah, something along those lines. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1748.46s)]
*  In just about any other grocery store in America, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1750.46s)]
*  you'll probably get, or anywhere, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1752.46s)]
*  probably you'll get a better melon. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1754.46s)]
*  So we got scammed, but not with this presentation. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1756.46s)]
*  But this is a special... [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1758.46s)]
*  Hold the popple, the popple's worth it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1760.46s)]
*  The popple's fine. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1762.46s)]
*  We got scammed, however, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1764.46s)]
*  does anyone want the apple? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1766.46s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1768.46s)]
*  So regardless of the scam, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1770.46s)]
*  the final, the final piece here [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1772.46s)]
*  is actually [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1774.46s)]
*  the white strawberries. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1776.46s)]
*  These are like specific, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1780.46s)]
*  I don't think they do like genetic modification. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1782.46s)]
*  I think it's literally just like [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1784.46s)]
*  hand-picked in bread basically [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1786.46s)]
*  for a very long time. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1788.46s)]
*  In an effort to, you know, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1790.46s)]
*  I guess that is technically genetic modification. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1792.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1794.46s)]
*  Is eugenics. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1796.46s)]
*  White strawberries are meh? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1798.46s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1800.46s)]
*  Yeah, they're fine. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1802.46s)]
*  I'm not crazy about them. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1804.46s)]
*  White strawberries are what? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1806.46s)]
*  I'm gonna have another group. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1808.46s)]
*  Is anyone opposed to me eating one of these groups? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1810.46s)]
*  No, I think totally genetically modified. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1812.46s)]
*  Would anyone else like this group? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1814.46s)]
*  Yeah, but I meant like, when I say, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1816.46s)]
*  when I'm thinking of GMO, I'm thinking like, you know, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1818.46s)]
*  chemicals, yeah. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1820.46s)]
*  Like hormones that they pump it with. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1822.46s)]
*  So I just had more of that melon. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1824.46s)]
*  Yeah? It's pretty good. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1826.46s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were gonna come out with some crazy shit. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1828.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1830.46s)]
*  Alright. The last... [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1832.46s)]
*  This is apparently the best coffee [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1834.46s)]
*  in the world. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1836.46s)]
*  It's totally... [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1838.46s)]
*  These ones are the best ginger in the world. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1840.46s)]
*  Gaijin Aby. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1846.46s)]
*  Fruit in Japan is considered a delicacy. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1854.46s)]
*  It's gonna be expensive there. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1856.46s)]
*  That price is normal. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1858.46s)]
*  Okay. I'm off to get it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1860.46s)]
*  Wait, what the fuck? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1862.46s)]
*  Oh, there's a scent to it. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1864.46s)]
*  Alright, that's considered the best strawberries in the world. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1866.46s)]
*  Oh, it smells really good. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1868.46s)]
*  It has the one on it. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1870.46s)]
*  Those look amazing. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1872.46s)]
*  I mean, look at the presentation on this shit. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1874.46s)]
*  God damn, okay. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1876.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1878.46s)]
*  It's not popcorn. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1880.46s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1882.46s)]
*  I don't know if that is the thing. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1884.46s)]
*  But here you go. Grab one. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1886.46s)]
*  Damn. Okay. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1888.46s)]
*  I'm gonna go for the white one. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1890.46s)]
*  Wait. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1892.46s)]
*  I'm about to get scammed again. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1898.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1900.46s)]
*  Kanpai. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1902.46s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1904.46s)]
*  The best strawberry in the world. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1906.46s)]
*  It's great. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1912.46s)]
*  It's made. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1914.46s)]
*  I literally had [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1916.46s)]
*  better strawberries when I first came in [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1918.46s)]
*  at my hotel. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1920.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1922.46s)]
*  I think this is just for the fact that it's white. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1924.46s)]
*  It's wide. It's okay. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1926.46s)]
*  It's pretty. Not even that sweet. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1928.46s)]
*  Are you a text reader? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1930.46s)]
*  Not really. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1932.46s)]
*  I'm a big text reader and because of that [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1934.46s)]
*  typically the fruits that people think are exceptional [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1936.46s)]
*  are very ripened and soft. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1938.46s)]
*  And I feel very opposite that. So this might be [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1940.46s)]
*  to a real connoisseur grapefruit. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1942.46s)]
*  But I think it's mid. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1944.46s)]
*  Because the flavors are good. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1946.46s)]
*  Flavors are all good. Yeah. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1948.46s)]
*  I think textually [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1950.46s)]
*  it tastes like mashed potatoes. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1952.46s)]
*  But the strawberry, it's the juices that are [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1954.46s)]
*  inside that you guys are missing out on. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1956.46s)]
*  Delightable. I think that was a great strawberry. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1958.46s)]
*  You're just saying that because you want to say shit. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1960.46s)]
*  There's not. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1962.46s)]
*  That's your whole stream, Asan. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1964.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1966.46s)]
*  Sometimes I like to beat stuff. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1968.46s)]
*  This is a cookie from that store which I also got. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1970.46s)]
*  This is probably the better. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1972.46s)]
*  I'm about to hit it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1974.46s)]
*  Alright. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1976.46s)]
*  Here. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1978.46s)]
*  Okay. Fuck. Here. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1984.46s)]
*  Yeah, that was better than all the fruit. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1986.46s)]
*  The cookie is better than the fruit? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1988.46s)]
*  Yeah. I want to try it with the strawberry together. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1990.46s)]
*  I want to do an experiment. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1992.46s)]
*  See how [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1994.46s)]
*  she makes it better. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1996.46s)]
*  You had the ones with cookies last night [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=1998.46s)]
*  because you were hungry. Was that good? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2000.46s)]
*  Asan, you have to realize [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2002.46s)]
*  me and Wake, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2004.46s)]
*  for breakfast today, I had [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2006.46s)]
*  just the chicken. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2008.46s)]
*  That's it. And I liked it. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2010.46s)]
*  So anything is good to me. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2012.46s)]
*  Anything tastes good. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2014.46s)]
*  Asan is the closest to the same kind of fucked up [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2016.46s)]
*  we are when it comes to that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2018.46s)]
*  When I'm in Japan, I eat whatever. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2020.46s)]
*  I had salmon and I grilled chicken. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2022.46s)]
*  That's evidence by the fact that I'm hitting these fruits. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2024.46s)]
*  I'm going to hit another one of these bad boys. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2026.46s)]
*  You all are okay with that? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2028.46s)]
*  Yours was good. With a cookie [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2030.46s)]
*  The cookie is better actually. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2032.46s)]
*  Let me have another song grabbing strawberry. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2034.46s)]
*  I think this is mostly, I'll be honest, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2038.46s)]
*  chat, this is mostly [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2040.46s)]
*  aesthetics. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2042.46s)]
*  It was beautiful, the presentation was beautiful. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2044.46s)]
*  But [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2046.46s)]
*  it [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2048.46s)]
*  wasn't exceptional at all. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2050.46s)]
*  The strawberries that I had when I first [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2052.46s)]
*  landed in my hotel [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2054.46s)]
*  and I showed on stream [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2056.46s)]
*  I showed on stream what they were. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2058.46s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2060.46s)]
*  Wait, get a close up of this one. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2062.46s)]
*  You can see how this is the best [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2064.46s)]
*  strawberry in the world according to [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2066.46s)]
*  people in Japan. According to science. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2068.46s)]
*  You can see how it goes up with the white. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2070.46s)]
*  However, on the bottom texture it's also pink. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2072.46s)]
*  Which gives it that nice extra juice. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2074.46s)]
*  Can you give it a little Gordon? Yeah, sure. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2076.46s)]
*  Of course. You've got the top green, beautiful on the side. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2078.46s)]
*  Looks fantastic. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2080.46s)]
*  Slowly getting more white. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2082.46s)]
*  They call that whitewashed. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2084.46s)]
*  We're going to try it. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2086.46s)]
*  Let's try this and see if it's good. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2088.46s)]
*  Stunning. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2094.46s)]
*  The most delicious. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2096.46s)]
*  That's all, that's the best strawberry in the world. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2100.46s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2102.46s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2104.46s)]
*  I think it's a [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2108.46s)]
*  normal ass strawberry. It's not that good. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2110.46s)]
*  It's just like, kind of mint. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2112.46s)]
*  Really. I think there's, I guess, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2114.46s)]
*  I think it's because you [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2116.46s)]
*  are a texture guy. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2118.46s)]
*  I don't think so. I wanted [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2120.46s)]
*  it to be sweet and tasty. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2122.46s)]
*  And to me it was not that sweet. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2124.46s)]
*  Nor was it that tasty. Like, do you like smoothies? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2126.46s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2128.46s)]
*  What? That just throws everything I was going to say away. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2130.46s)]
*  Like, what were you going to say? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2132.46s)]
*  If you didn't like smoothies, I'd say you don't like that [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2134.46s)]
*  soft texture. I didn't like the [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2136.46s)]
*  texture on the apple. I hated it. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2138.46s)]
*  Yeah, actually [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2140.46s)]
*  out of everything, I think the apple was the worst. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2142.46s)]
*  That was absolutely shitty. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2144.46s)]
*  It was red. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2146.46s)]
*  That was why. Yeah, no. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2148.46s)]
*  It was like... No, a red [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2150.46s)]
*  apple can be great. Yeah, actually [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2152.46s)]
*  you don't like red apples? I mean it. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2154.46s)]
*  I've had an apple from 7-Eleven almost [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2156.46s)]
*  every day since I've been here and they are infinitely [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2158.46s)]
*  better than whatever that was. You know what I've had [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2160.46s)]
*  that I really like now? Pancakes. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2162.46s)]
*  At Family Mart. Oh, bro. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2164.46s)]
*  The margarine syrup ones. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2166.46s)]
*  Why do I feel weird? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2168.46s)]
*  Because you are. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2170.46s)]
*  Yo, are you going to defend me? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2172.46s)]
*  No. As my friend? Absolutely [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2174.46s)]
*  not. I think it's awesome. It's cool to [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2176.46s)]
*  be wearing you. I know. It's a good thing to be [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2178.46s)]
*  wearing. Yeah, Hasan doesn't like it though. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2180.46s)]
*  Doesn't like what? Me being weird. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2182.46s)]
*  No, I love it. Yeah, see? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2184.46s)]
*  I don't like it. I love it. I hate those pants [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2186.46s)]
*  though. I wish you were still wearing the fucking [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2188.46s)]
*  the Uniqlo pants that you [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2190.46s)]
*  were dancing in. Those were better than these. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2192.46s)]
*  Chad, is this... Can I get laid in [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2194.46s)]
*  these bad boys? No. Is that a [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2196.46s)]
*  slim? Yeah. But don't [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2198.46s)]
*  worry. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2200.46s)]
*  We can go and... [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2202.46s)]
*  There's places we can shop around here, right? Like a vintage [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2204.46s)]
*  store or something? Yes. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2206.46s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2208.46s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yes. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2210.46s)]
*  What kind of vintage are you looking [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2212.46s)]

*  It's an example. No, these are great. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2290.46s)]

*  Okay, I gotta be honest with you. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2300.46s)]
*  This shisha, this melon shisha, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2302.46s)]
*  tastes better than this melon. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2304.46s)]
*  Maybe you can bite the melon and... [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2306.46s)]
*  I just got tobacco in it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2308.46s)]
*  I don't smoke. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2310.46s)]
*  It's a tiny bit of tobacco, but it's really good. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2312.46s)]
*  Are you not? None of you? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2314.46s)]
*  I'll do it. I've never had one. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2316.46s)]
*  It is not the tiniest bit of tobacco. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2318.46s)]
*  It's a ton of tobacco. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2320.46s)]
*  There's usually more tobacco than... [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2322.46s)]
*  It's easy to smoke. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2324.46s)]
*  And honestly, it's like [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2326.46s)]
*  better than that. My friends and I went through [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2328.46s)]
*  a period where we, in high school, were buying [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2330.46s)]
*  hookahs off Craigslist from just like [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2332.46s)]
*  dudes in their 30s who were into Dave Matthews' band [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2334.46s)]
*  and it was the weirdest [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2336.46s)]
*  time of my life. Like, we'd sit there and we'd rip these [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2338.46s)]
*  for like 4 or 5 hours. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2340.46s)]

*  you know. Josh, should I do it? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2394.46s)]

*  If you want to, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2398.46s)]
*  I mean, look, it's tobacco. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2400.46s)]

*  Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2412.46s)]
*  How's it flavor? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2414.46s)]
*  It tastes like [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2416.46s)]
*  like a lollipop from CVS. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2418.46s)]
*  It's very sweet [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2420.46s)]
*  and easy to smoke. Like, it's not hardening your lungs at all. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2422.46s)]

*  No, it's not like that. It's just [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2450.46s)]
*  If you consume any sort of tobacco product, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2452.46s)]

*  man and then they have to bust someone around [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2970.46s)]
*  because they feel like they get bust around all the time. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=2972.46s)]

*  I'm going to rip a desktop stream [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3000.46s)]
*  tomorrow. Would you want to close my [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3002.46s)]
*  stream? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3004.46s)]
*  Yeah, we can do whatever you want to do. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3006.46s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3008.46s)]
*  Let me ask. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3010.46s)]
*  Wait, here. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3012.46s)]
*  You want to try to log into my server? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3014.46s)]
*  And we can see for [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3016.46s)]
*  how long, however long the battery lasts. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3018.46s)]
*  We can try to rip the stream. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3020.46s)]
*  How long would it last? I don't know. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3022.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3024.46s)]
*  Here, then you're going to have to log in. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3028.46s)]
*  I'm just going to put this here for a second. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3030.46s)]
*  You are the dancing queen. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3032.46s)]
*  Watch that scene. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3034.46s)]
*  Only 17. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3036.46s)]
*  But it's like automatically, it's probably going to try to [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3042.46s)]
*  log into my Twitch. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3044.46s)]
*  Here, log [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3048.46s)]
*  into yours. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3050.46s)]
*  You don't know how to log into your Twitch? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3054.46s)]
*  I don't know my passwords. You don't know your [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3056.46s)]
*  password? No. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3058.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3060.46s)]
*  Here's Frank. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3062.46s)]
*  No, I just want to move it away from [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3066.46s)]
*  Miz. And also it's low. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3068.46s)]
*  This thing does not hold [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3070.46s)]
*  well, yeah. It does, but it doesn't [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3072.46s)]
*  hold very well. It doesn't [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3074.46s)]
*  hold at the top. It always, the weight of it [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3076.46s)]
*  will slowly but surely make it [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3078.46s)]
*  move down. Yep. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3080.46s)]
*  That's fine, though. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3082.46s)]
*  But just don't show Miz's [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3084.46s)]
*  phone, because he's literally looking at his passwords. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3086.46s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3088.46s)]
*  I'm trying to [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3092.46s)]
*  You know you flip it? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3094.46s)]
*  Yeah, no. I got it flipped enough. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3096.46s)]
*  That way you can go back in. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3098.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3100.46s)]
*  Will they clean this stuff up? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3104.46s)]
*  Or do we have to do it ourselves? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3106.46s)]
*  Can we give it to [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3108.46s)]
*  them? Yeah. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3110.46s)]
*  Can we give them the [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3112.46s)]
*  No, that's fine. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3114.46s)]
*  The white strawberries? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3116.46s)]
*  No, that's fine. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3118.46s)]
*  I'm glad you thought about [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3124.46s)]
*  that, Hasan. I'm really glad that [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3126.46s)]
*  He's actually a great guy. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3128.46s)]
*  He gets a lot of hate. I can start [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3130.46s)]
*  your stream now, whatever you want. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3132.46s)]
*  Wait, let me change the title. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3134.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3136.46s)]
*  But that was a really nice thing you just thought about. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3138.46s)]
*  I gave you D.Va. It's probably because I'm [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3140.46s)]
*  like, it's chaotic. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3142.46s)]
*  And I'm bad at responding to text messages. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3144.46s)]
*  Jazz, did you enjoy the stream today? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3164.46s)]
*  It still blows my mind how [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3168.46s)]
*  versatile of a streamer you are. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3170.46s)]
*  Which was your favorite dance move [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3174.46s)]
*  in the Pada Pada today? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3176.46s)]
*  Me? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3178.46s)]
*  The Egyptian one? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3180.46s)]
*  I liked the [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3182.46s)]
*  Humping the Air. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3184.46s)]
*  That was my favorite one. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3186.46s)]
*  Actually, I like the Pada Pada part too. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3188.46s)]
*  That's the classic. Now you [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3194.46s)]
*  can be [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3196.46s)]
*  certified for that. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3198.46s)]
*  Now I know what the Riff off is. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3200.46s)]
*  Now I know what the Riff is. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3202.46s)]
*  Every time someone's like, yo, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3204.46s)]
*  do a Be Cute or do [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3206.46s)]
*  a cool dance. Now I have a cool dance move. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3208.46s)]
*  You have one off Riff. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3210.46s)]
*  Chat, should I go live? Yes or no? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3212.46s)]
*  Chat, should I stream? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3216.46s)]
*  You're saying [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3220.46s)]
*  the camera's really out of focus? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3222.46s)]
*  Just put it back to whatever it was. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3224.46s)]
*  Why does it automatically [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3226.46s)]
*  flip back to manual even if I put it on auto? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3228.46s)]
*  I would appreciate more. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3230.46s)]
*  You want to stream with me? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3232.46s)]
*  Do a 2 hour stream? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRzBtrg5CI&t=3234.46s)]
