# Trump And His Picks Are In Trouble | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ)
*  Oh, the hush money case sentencing delayed for the third times is the guilty verdict. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=0.0s)]
*  All of the American instruments of justice are caving and capitulating to the, the Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=5.28s)]
*  It's great. It's fantastic. America is in the America is in the toilet. Democrats once [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  again lost the race to a guy and a party that does not care about institutions whatsoever. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=17.64s)]
*  And then when he got curved by a doll, everything changed for him. You know what I mean? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=30.0s)]
*  We'll quickly to replace former Congressman Matt Gaetz after he withdrew as nominee for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=34.08s)]
*  attorney general, replacing the former Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, chief Washington [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=38.0s)]
*  correspondent, Jonathan Carlson, Mar-a-Lago with the latest on that. Good morning, John. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=42.32s)]
*  Where'd you get that scarf? I got it at the DNC. There was a member of the uncommitted [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=45.32s)]
*  movement that was at the DNC that gave it to me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=49.8s)]
*  Good morning, George. With Donald Trump's new pick to be attorney general, Trump is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  showing once again that among the top qualifications he is seeking for his cabinet is personal [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=58.0s)]
*  loyalty. Just hours after former Congressman Matt Gaetz dropped his embattled bid to be [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=63.56s)]
*  attorney general, Donald Trump had a new choice to run the justice department. Former Florida [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=68.84s)]
*  attorney general Pam Bondi, a Trump loyalist, sometimes seen on stage at Trump rallies. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=74.4s)]
*  President Trump has been out there fighting for us nonstop. And if he's out there fighting [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=80.56s)]
*  for us, we're going to fight for him. And announcing his choice, Trump praised Bondi [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=86.64s)]
*  as a smart and tough America first fighter pledging. She will quote, refocus the DOJ [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=91.48s)]
*  to its intended purpose of fighting. Dude. It Trump literally went from Matt Gaetz who [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=97.84s)]
*  was going to be loyal to him, obviously above all else to a person who he literally paid [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=102.8s)]
*  to be his lawyer. Like, I mean, we already knew, we already knew that he was going to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=108.78s)]
*  go over the loyalty pig, but like, it is pretty funny. I mean, this is like, I'll just say [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=114.4s)]
*  it like this. Institutional norm defenders freak out over this, but like, I mean, you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=119.12s)]
*  know, JFK did something similar to, right? It's just something that people do. Okay. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  Don't you always pay lawyers? I'm just saying like he, someone who he paid to engage in [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=130.08s)]
*  legal defense for him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=135.24s)]
*  Katari cat. Thank you for the hard to give the subs. Holy shit. God damn. We're in the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  pocket of cutter. Ladies and gentlemen, you already know. You already know we're in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=142.64s)]
*  pocket of big oilers. We got cutter in the building. Also chatters talking about how [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=147.04s)]
*  like, don't you always pay your lawyers? If you're Donald Trump, no, you don't always [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=151.72s)]
*  pay your lawyers. Okay. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=155.64s)]
*  Crime and making America safe again. Bondi served as Florida's attorney general from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=157.64s)]
*  2011 to 2019, a tenure, not without controversy, including her decision to pass on a case against [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  Trump University shortly after receiving a donation from the Trump Foundation. But [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=169.76s)]
*  both Trump and Bondi deny any wrongdoing. After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=175.16s)]
*  election, Bondi backed Trump's false claims of election fraud. More recently, she has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=180.64s)]
*  worked as a lobbyist and a registered foreign agent among her past clients, the government [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  of cutter, perhaps most importantly to Trump. She's been a loyal member of his inner circle [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=190.72s)]
*  for years now, joining him on the campaign trail back in 2016. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=195.14s)]
*  I can tell you firsthand when it comes to law and order, you know, I don't mess around [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  and neither does Donald Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=205.26s)]
*  You know who else is not messing around? Stop giving a sheet who just gifted 50 gift to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  subs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And serving on. I don't know why big [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=211.98s)]
*  gifties are rolling in. And I didn't realize that this would be the case. As soon as I [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=216.26s)]
*  as but it's been oiling has been juicing. Okay. And I thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=221.74s)]
*  Thank you. Oh, it's the discount. Oh, that's probably why. God damn nice. Okay. Shouts [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  out. Shouts out. Final round brewing. They give the five cause Mont. Thank you for the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  five. Also, Kai hit a half a mil. Yeah. I saw Eagle team during his first impeachment [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=239.5s)]
*  They threw due process, fundamental fairness and our constitution out the window in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=245.82s)]
*  House proceedings. That's why we're here. Bondi's nomination comes after her fellow [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=251.38s)]
*  Florida Republican Matt Gates bowed out, withdrawing his bid. Amid allegations, he used drugs and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=255.82s)]
*  paid young women for sex. Sources tell ABC that one of the women also testified to the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=261.84s)]
*  House Ethics Committee that she saw Gates having sex with a Gates denies all of the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=267.38s)]
*  allegations. Gates is out, but there is renewed scrutiny on some of Trump's other nominees, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=272.54s)]
*  especially Pete Hegseth, a Fox News weekend anchor and Army veteran, Trump's choice for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=277.70000000000005s)]
*  defense secretary. We welcome the opportunity to talk to any senator that wants to talk [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=283.66s)]
*  to us. Hegseth has been meeting with Republican senators, making his case to be defense secretary. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=288.38s)]
*  He now faces scrutiny over past allegations of sexual misconduct accused of sexually assaulting [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=294.06s)]
*  a woman in 2017 allegations. He denies saying it was consensual in a recently released police [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=300.18s)]
*  report. A woman who met Hegseth at a conservative women's conference in 2017 told authorities [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=306.46s)]
*  he cornered her in a hotel room, took her phone and blocked the door with his body, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=312.34s)]
*  preventing her from leaving. She said he and that she remembered saying no a lot. The matter [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=317.98s)]
*  was fully investigated. I didn't know that the blocking the body blocking move. That's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=322.62s)]
*  crazy. And I was completely clear and that's where I'm gonna leave it. According to the report, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=326.62s)]
*  the police recommended the case be forwarded to a local district attorney for review and possible [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=332.46s)]
*  prosecution. Although Hegseth was never charged with a crime, but his attorney says he later [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=338.22s)]
*  paid a settlement to the woman to keep her from going public with the allegations because he [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=343.46s)]
*  feared they would hurt his career as a television anchor. Several Republicans have expressed support [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=348.3s)]
*  for Hegseth's nomination and one seemed to brush aside the allegations in the police report. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=353.5s)]
*  You can read the report yourself. If you read it, you can clearly see that it was two people [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=358.98s)]
*  talking to each other. Well, that's one person's opinion. Hegseth did not deny this one asked, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=363.58000000000004s)]
*  by the way, did you sexually assault a woman in Monterey, California? I have, as far as the media [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  is concerned, it's very simple. The matter was fully investigated. I was completely cleared and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=375.18s)]
*  that's where I'm gonna leave it. God damn, he almost popped off and was like, yeah, that's right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  I did that shit. For granted. And we welcome the opportunity to talk to any senator that wants to talk to us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=382.94s)]
*  Bitching sexually assault a woman in Monterey, California. I have, as far as the media is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=388.86s)]
*  concerned, it's very simple. The matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=393.42s)]
*  that's where I'm gonna leave it. Thank you very much. Hassan, what do you think the point of specifically picking [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=400.06s)]
*  p***s is? There was always psycho picks who aren't p***s, but Trump always insists on the p***s. Is it just supposed to be a f*** you to women? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=403.58s)]
*  I don't think it's a deliberate f*** you to women. I don't think this is like a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=409.5s)]
*  me too backlash or anything like that. I think because that's kind of how like people have been [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=412.7s)]
*  presenting it. I think it's just that these guys happen to be that way and also be massively loyal [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=418.62s)]
*  to Donald Trump, you know? Also it's Donald Trump. Like he's f***ing the person who has at least like [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=425.58s)]
*  in a civil litigation been found guilty of sexually assaulting E.G. and Carol. Like it's not, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=433.98s)]
*  you know what I mean? Like I don't think this is a thing he cares about, but I don't think it's in [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  the forefront of his mind. Like mine's type beat, right? Doesn't want to have people around who will [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=446.46s)]
*  call him out. I don't think any, I don't think a lot of the other men in his cabinet are going to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  call him out for that sort of behavior anyway. Like I think this is not like intentional, like he's not [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=455.18s)]
*  going at, I mean, I get why, I get why it comes across as like deliberate, you know what I mean? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=460.54s)]
*  Cause it's like, what the f*** every cabinet member has some kind of like sexual assault [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=467.26000000000005s)]
*  allegation. Like what the f*** is going on? You're like, this has got to be deliberate at this point. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=471.98s)]
*  And it's like, I don't think it's deliberate. I think just like, that is just how Trump loyalists [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=476.54s)]
*  are, you know? Many of them in positions of power happen to have these sorts of incidents in their [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=481.02000000000004s)]
*  past. Does that make sense? Like in the state of Florida, if you want to be a legislator, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=487.98s)]
*  you have to get a DUI. If you want to be a part of the Trump cabinet, like, you know, having some [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=492.38s)]
*  sexual assaults under your, you know, in your past certainly doesn't hurt and maybe even helps you, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=497.5s)]
*  you know? But it's more of a birds of a feather flock together type situation, rather than like [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=505.1s)]
*  deliberately picking people like to put together the greatest f*** squad of all time. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=509.58s)]
*  Like that's not, I don't think that's what he's trying to do. I've been trying to get you to watch [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=518.78s)]
*  this history on that question topic, history of teacher on how authoritarians, fascist appoint [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=522.54s)]
*  members of their cabinet. What is this? Political philosopher Hannah Arendt writes that fascists [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=526.46s)]
*  in power will quote, invariably replay balance with those crackpots and fools whose ignorance [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=531.8199999999999s)]
*  and lack of creativity is still a better guarantee of their loyalty, end quote. Fascism as an ideology [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=538.62s)]
*  might be easily understood as a sort of blind reactionary thinking, just this endless retaliation [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=545.66s)]
*  against real and imagined enemies pursuing the end of the true people having absolute authority, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=551.82s)]
*  but they do have to govern and most of the acts of governing are boring bureaucratic paper-pushing [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=557.74s)]
*  tasks. Well Arendt's quote in Origins of Totalitarianism is in reference to the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=565.74s)]
*  problems baked into a fascist structure at the foundational level, at the hiring and firing of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=571.42s)]
*  boring bureaucrats level. And what we mean by this is that loyalty, bro looks like he teaches the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=577.9s)]
*  f*** out of AP US history, yeah. The only real trait that is rewarded in a fascist system, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=584.0600000000001s)]
*  demonstrating instant obedience to orders and endless sycophancy to one's immediate supervisor, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=590.7s)]
*  Assam Piper, yo it's the terrorist supporter, what's up you clown chump ass dude defending his [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=597.66s)]
*  comrades slash cousins, please don't ban this guy, mods, we got a new pet, yo what's up dumbass, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=602.86s)]
*  yeah I bet you love defending your cousins who are doing terrorism overseas dog. Is the fastest way [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=610.22s)]
*  to get a job, fastest way to get promoted, and the way will be clear for you as opponents of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=616.54s)]
*  the regime lose their jobs, yeah I do pipe them, yeah don't pussies, a bunker for you, pussy, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=622.2199999999999s)]

*  we care about the institutions when these guys don't and it's like yeah well good luck with those [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=802.22s)]
*  institutions all right have fun with that they're gone they're done a criminal conviction has once [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=807.9s)]
*  again been delayed now this is the third time sentencing has been pushed back since Donald Trump [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=814.7s)]
*  was found guilty for his role in a cover-up of a hush money payment CBS News legal contributor [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  Caroline Polisi joining us now for more on this what do you make of this decision by this judge [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=825.9s)]
*  Caroline it's the third time they made this decision to delay it that's right Liz I think we [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=831.5s)]
*  all sort of saw the writing on the wall it's just now that we know definitively that the sentence [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=836.46s)]
*  will be adjourned what's happening now is really what both parties had agreed to remember we heard [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=842.06s)]
*  from Alvin Bragg's office last week really previewing that the Trump team would was wanting to put for [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=848.94s)]
*  this motion to dismiss acknowledging that there are serious considerations to take into account [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=856.7s)]
*  now that Trump is president-elect while also balancing this idea that he has been convicted [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=862.3s)]
*  of 34 felony counts they noted that they would oppose this motion to dismiss but that they were [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=870.22s)]
*  willing to put the sentencing on hold for the interest of justice we got a lot more ahead [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=876.22s)]
*  before we can get to sentencing two motions one the judge Mershon will need to decide on this [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=883.34s)]
*  the most recent motion to dismiss the Trump team has until December 2nd to file that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=890.62s)]
*  Alvin Bragg's office will respond by December 9th and then we have Mershon needing to decide [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=896.22s)]
*  the Supreme Court immunity issue that Trump's team put forth saying this entire thing needs to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=903.26s)]
*  be tossed out so we have to get those two issues off the table before we can even think about going [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=909.26s)]
*  to sentencing how does the judge's decision today to delay this indefinitely does that impact [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=914.62s)]
*  Trump's other legal cases no not at all look the issue in the motion to dismiss here has to do with [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=921.26s)]
*  constitutional principles having to do with separation of powers and issues in the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=928.7s)]
*  constitution really an idea of sort of a unitary executive that the the president and they're [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=934.14s)]
*  saying the president-elect now should not have to face criminal prosecution while in office or in [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=939.74s)]
*  this pre-election period now that's the issue that jack smith in the federal cases is is grappling [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=945.18s)]
*  with right now and why in fact he's winding down those federal cases they're going to go away [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=951.18s)]
*  basically because we do have this these principles that the office of legal counsel has said a sitting [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=956.38s)]
*  president can't be prosecuted federally and then that georgia case has been sort of uh you know in [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=962.94s)]
*  the background there for a while the appeals court in georgia just took that calendar date off the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=969.5s)]
*  schedule um you know there are issues with that prosecution as well so we're seeing really all of [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=974.7800000000001s)]
*  these uh prosecutions foundering donald trump takes the oath of office on january 20th how likely do [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=981.1800000000001s)]
*  you think that this particular case is going to get thrown out oh thrown out um that i don't know [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=987.74s)]
*  there are a lot of issues and and trust me trump will appeal these issues uh until the end he's [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=994.3s)]
*  not going to sort of take this lightly he has another appellate issue wanting to remove this [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1000.86s)]
*  case to federal court i suspect he would not want to move forward with any sentencing he will make [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1006.0600000000001s)]
*  many arguments to say why they shouldn't move forward with sentencing prior to the election [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1013.34s)]
*  excuse me to uh hims being sworn in it could take place prior and then they could hold it in [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1018.46s)]
*  advance essentially throughout those four years for him to serve it thereafter but there are issues [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1024.06s)]
*  with that as well so i think you know we're likely to see a lot more litigation about this case play [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1029.1000000000001s)]
*  out prior to january 20th does anything change once president-elect trump officially becomes [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1034.78s)]
*  president i mean i think a lot of people are curious is it possible he could pardon himself [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1041.02s)]
*  is that even possible with this case it's not possible for this case it is possible for the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1044.86s)]
*  federal cases but that won't be necessary because we know that jack smith is winding those down [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1049.5s)]
*  likely he will want to have those dismissed without prejudice prior to trump taking office [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1054.1399999999999s)]
*  but no he cannot how many dummies out there think republicans are drop charges ahead of a democrat [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1058.62s)]
*  coming in are you kidding me are you kidding me that would never fucking happen in a million years [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1062.62s)]
*  and uh i mean republicans will literally point to all of the quote unquote lawfare that happened [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1068.38s)]
*  under the biden regime to enact whatever their political agenda is and purposefully continue [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1076.7s)]

*  sibling while scrolling through pornhub what is your first course of action nice one that that [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1480.3s)]
*  matt gates is a pedophile and here's the thing technically speaking technically speaking matt [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1485.74s)]
*  gates is not a pedophile and just hear me out for one second the term pedophile refers to people who [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1491.1s)]
*  are attracted to those that are pre-pubescent then there's something called the hebephile that's [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1495.5s)]
*  people are attracted to those in the early stages of puberty like 11 12 13 14 and then there's [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1499.82s)]
*  something called an e-fibophile that's people attracted to those that are the later stages of [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1503.58s)]
*  puberty like 15 16 17 18 but i think the reason we don't make those distinctions is because it's [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1507.58s)]
*  very hard to explain the difference without sounding like a pedophile that dude stole that bit [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1513.9s)]
*  i'm pretty sure i mean this is a classic it's not even a bit it's something that i've talked about [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1520.22s)]
*  quite a bit as well when you try to make this like a semantics distinction between a febafile [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1524.38s)]
*  and pedophile okay you are literally saying no no no you don't understand there are some minors that [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1532.5400000000002s)]
*  you would fuck okay and that's insane it is a repugnant position and the reality of the matter [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1538.46s)]
*  is that people are feeling a lot more comfortable doing that and it's gross don't call it a position [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1545.98s)]
*  no it is it is becoming a position there are genuinely people know that's his own bit he [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1553.18s)]
*  repurposed it for gates i mean it's also a classic it's it's a classic idiotic thing okay he's not [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1558.78s)]
*  the first i mean i've said it as well i've said something similar to that multiple times as well [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1565.98s)]

*  like a maybe i'm wrong but i feel like there was a a period where people were at least like somewhat [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1651.9s)]
*  embarrassed to argue that position or maybe i was just echo chambered into a a specific part of the [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1657.82s)]
*  internet where like that kind of sentiment being expressed immediately got backlash understandable [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1667.02s)]
*  okay and i don't know i don't know if that was the case but like i mean this also does correspond [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1677.6599999999999s)]
*  to my consistent anti-pedophilia position that has seemingly created a a you know injustice league [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1684.14s)]
*  of like the grossest freaks that constantly find themselves in trouble for doing that sort of thing [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1695.74s)]

*  there are some clips coming out now from d debating that position a long time ago was some wild [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1710.46s)]
*  personal comments yeah whoa whoa whoa this is a very extremist take yeah i know i am uh i have [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1714.54s)]

*  not wrong but your stance about controlling language in order to politicize speech which [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1729.58s)]
*  makes things kind of difficult to discern even in the process of fighting for the same part of the [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1732.54s)]

*  career the notion that like i am trying to control language and politicize speech because i [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1766.22s)]
*  don't think that uh hate speech is appropriate is is so fucking stupid okay there is not a single [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1771.8999999999999s)]

*  i'm not arguing yes i'm not necessarily saying we should start to use hebe hebe file or how it's [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1900.54s)]
*  written i'm just trying to expand on the context of why people might be triggered about it dude [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1905.5s)]
*  there is no reason to to engage in this battle okay especially because the underlying sentiment [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1909.82s)]
*  is you're saying some minors are more fuckable than others okay that is insane there is no reason to [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1916.3s)]

*  that's a you know pretty reasonable take for me they just want to make sure this place is in an [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1929.34s)]
*  echo chamber no we can be an echo chamber we can be an anti-pedophilia echo chamber i think that's [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1933.66s)]
*  like someone telling you it's not murder it's manslaughter and you calling them a murderer for [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1938.22s)]
*  it arguing semantics doesn't make you a pedophile wait what i don't think people are trying to [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1941.98s)]
*  normalize manslaughter when they're talking about the legal distinctions okay please understand [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1947.02s)]
*  what is happening why is this such a major fucking issue arguing semantics makes you a nerd not a [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1955.82s)]
*  pedophile just because there's a different word for the different age groups doesn't mean is saying [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1960.54s)]
*  you want to fuck those age groups no the underlying sentiment behind saying actually it's a feebe file [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1963.74s)]
*  one it's most commonly held by people who do want to fuck miners libertarians and two is literally [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1970.78s)]
*  saying no there is a type of miner that is more fuckable than the rest that's all you're saying [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1979.82s)]
*  that's the reason why you're hyper focusing on this distinction and you're doing it to a [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1986.22s)]
*  you're doing it to a a community that just doesn't make that distinction at all what is going on [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1991.82s)]
*  debate purvis can't help themselves with this topic yeah this is why i fucking despise the [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=1998.3s)]
*  toxicity that comes along with a community that loves debating because i think that a community [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=2003.34s)]
*  that loves debating it will inevitably will inevitably always arrive at like these sorts [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=2008.78s)]
*  of idiotic distinctions where they're like being hyper specific and and being semantics nerds [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=2013.5s)]
*  okay that distinction only matters when you're making when you're making a a psychological [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=2019.18s)]
*  assessment okay that's it that distinction has no basis here and that distinction is only potentially [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=2024.54s)]
*  uh important when i don't know uh issuing a criminal punishment okay i don't like this [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=2032.0600000000002s)]

*  of wild uh diatribes but then yeah there's that question to audiences is it by even going on their [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=2265.66s)]
*  platform or by platform um are you validating and now you're shutting yourself away from those [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhbv7SQAhQ&t=2274.94s)]
