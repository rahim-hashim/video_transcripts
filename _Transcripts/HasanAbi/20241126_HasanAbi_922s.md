**HasanAbi:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8)
*  Let me tell you, we are gonna have words. Okay, I am here to tell you what I think. That's right. Like, how is this news man? How is this news? She's a Cuba. She's Cuban. What are these people saying? What the hell man? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=0.0s)]
*  Are you talking about this story? Ana de Armas apparently is getting in hot water because she's dating the stepson of Cuba's president, which is so crazy. The Cuban diaspora once again, the Cuban diaspora in the United States of America once again. Hey, hey, chill out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=24.56s)]
*  God damn, Fiona's here. And their guy is of course not being normal. Cuban diaspora in the United States of America are so crazy. Because they're like, they're mad at a Cuban woman who like grew up in Oh, this woman isn't even Cuban. She's just from Miami. Wait, shut the fuck up. She's not even Cuban. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=49.56s)]
*  Cuban but I grew up in Miami. Okay. The majority of my friends are Cuban. I'm not Cuban, but I grew up in Miami. Okay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=72.0s)]
*  Dog, are you fucking for real? Are you fucking insane? So you're mad at a Cuban woman for dating the stepson of the Cuban president? Like you're larping as a Cuban diaspora guy? What the fuck? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=78.28s)]
*  Bro, Ana de Armas grew up in Cuba. Like, like she's she's Cuban Spaniard. But like she grew up in Cuba until she was 18, if I'm not mistaken. Am I wrong? Isn't she Cuban? Like she's literally fucking Cuban. What are we doing? This is a 36 year old Cuban woman who was in a consensual adult relationship with another Cuban man. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=94.28s)]
*  And my friends are like, I don't think that's valid. What the fuck? These people are out of control, man. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=118.6s)]
*  Okay, the majority of my friends are Cuban. The majority of people who taught me in school, my teachers, the people who fed me, the parents of my friends, the people who supported me who picked me up from school, my after school program counselors, my summer camp counselors, Cuban people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=126.32s)]
*  Ana de Armas is Cuban. She lived in Cuba until she was 18. What the fuck are you saying? She's like, nobody in the right mind. Nobody in the right mind would ever dare like Cuba or date another Cuban person. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, listen, guys, listen, essay. I am not Mexicano. Okay, I am not Chicano. I have been around Latinx. Okay, let me tell you, I do not speak a lick of Spanish. No hables Espanol, essay. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=160.12s)]
*  But if I catch a Mexican celebrity dating the Morena party's Claudia Scheinbaum, let me tell you, we are gonna have words. Okay, I am here to tell you what I think. That's right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=185.4s)]
*  Like, how is this news, man? How is this fucking news? She's a traitor to Cuba. Bitch, she's Cuban. What are these people saying? What the hell, man? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=209.36s)]
*  I hate criticizing women, especially Latin women. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=222.0s)]
*  The stepson of a dictator is a slap in the face of the community that supports her, not even the Latin community, but her Cuban. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=227.84s)]
*  What the hell is going on, dude? Yo, Americans need to shut the fuck up. Okay. Americans need to shut their dumb asses up. I'm done. Okay. If you're an American, fuck you. Okay. If you're an American, you need to shut your... [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=234.08s)]
*  Okay, you're done. You're done. No more Americans. No more American conversations. I do not want to hear from anyone in Miami. I do not care what you have to say. I do not want to hear anything that you are. If you're from Miami, I don't want to hear anything you have to say about anything at all. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=248.68s)]
*  Go back to cryptocurrencies. Go back to talking about fucking rug pulls or whatever the fuck you're... Okay, I'm done. I'm done. We need to do a Xi Jinping style firewall on the internet in Florida. That's hurtful big... Okay, I'm fucking joking. God damn it, chatters. Let me chirp. Fuck. Without people being like, oh, are you talking about me? I'm in Cuba. I mean, I'm in Florida, Cuba. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=269.0s)]
*  Cuba is in crisis, but that's not the only thing that is insane to me. What's more insane to me is seeing Cuban people in... [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=299.0s)]
*  This woman is 34 and American talking about another 36 year old woman who is Cuban dating the steps son of the Cuban president. Like, it makes no damn sense, man. You should be embarrassed to put this out there. You should be embarrassed to say these things. And honestly, there's a hell of people who are probably fucking harping this up. Like they're hyping it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=308.0s)]
*  In common sections, sharing their lived experience, their lived experience. I don't know about you, but with me, when a community tells me that they are in crisis, or this happened to them, and they need this and they need that, and this is what's going on, I believe them. Maybe that's just me. Maybe that's just me. But to have people who are not Cuban, who are not Cuban, have maybe read a book many years ago or given something on Google or been on Reddit telling... [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=329.24s)]
*  Explain why this is embarrassing. What? Explain why this is embarrassing. She is a random American living in Miami, shitting on a Cuban woman who's 36 goddamn years old. Okay. Dating the son of the steps son of the Cuban president. Like, why the fuck? Mind your own damn business. What the hell? She ain't even Cuban. What's going on, dude? Why we can't just say mind your damn [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=354.76s)]
*  business? What the hell is this? Like, she's not even Cuban. I thought she was a Cuban diaspora person who's like, he's gonna start talking about how like, Cubans are eating rats or whatever the fuck. You know, and then she opened up by being like, excuse me, I'm not even Cuban, but I've been around Cubans. And let me tell you, okay, they have some words for old Fidel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=384.24s)]
*  Cuban people that they are wrong about their lived experience and it is propaganda is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  the embarrassing part of that she's not Cuban, but it's calling out the Cuban woman for being traders basically that but also simultaneously even if they were a Cuban American like they're still shitting on a Cuban person making this voluntary decision. Do you understand? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=410.32s)]
*  I'm not Cuban, but I grew up in Miami. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=424.28000000000003s)]

No, she's from Miami. Oh, you're talking about the TikTok girl. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXYzB7E3Y8&t=425.8s)]
