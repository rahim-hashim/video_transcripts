# HasanAbi Destroys OTK Gameday!
**HasanAbi:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg)
*  This we might be approaching a world record for shot attempts without a basket at this point. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=0.0s)]
*  Hassan trying to do something about it and he cannot ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7.9s)]
*  And he breaks the cold streak. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=12.9s)]
*  Hassan Piker shooting one for 482 tonight. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=16.48s)]
*  Yeah man I tell you what it's not a good ratio but he got it done. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=20.28s)]
*  Wake he put those points on the board. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=24.46s)]
*  Well now we're all tied up at two. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  Please no I want to hear all about it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=30.0s)]
*  I mean I know Hassan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=36.8s)]
*  Who's your killer? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=37.8s)]
*  Who do you have your eye on right now? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=38.8s)]
*  Well I really do have my eye on Hassan Piker because he is very old. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=40.64s)]
*  We do know that he is getting towards the end of his basketball career. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=46.04s)]
*  I think he's 42. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=49.68s)]
*  Somewhere around there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  42 and counting. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  He ages at an accelerated pace. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Science is still out on it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=56.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=58.6s)]
*  And he's a very old player and he has been reported to be injury prone. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=60.2s)]
*  I think most recently he threw out his hip and he's had some knee problems. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  We'll see how that plays out in today's basketball contest. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=71.04s)]
*  Well all glass hip Piker is going to be the key to victory for whatever team he finds [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=76.12s)]
*  himself on. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=79.8s)]
*  We have four big players here that we want to look for. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=80.8s)]
*  We have none other than Hassan Piker as you noted. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=83.92s)]
*  We have Differ PK, Rafflegator and TechTone. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=87.56s)]
*  Now why do I mention these four? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=91.92s)]
*  Because they're all tall. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=94.16s)]
*  That is the only thing you really need to be good at basketball especially in the context [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=96.28s)]
*  of people who sit professionally. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=101.84s)]
*  So when we have four people who are great at sitting but are also tall we've got to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=104.48s)]
*  mess on our hands. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=112.72s)]
*  It could snowball out of hand quickly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=113.72s)]
*  We're going to need to see two and two on each team or we're going to see a real lopsided [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  just a whopping. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  And you also got some very big people that aren't necessarily coordinated. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  And I think when you combine bigger people with a lack of coordination you get some very [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  interesting and I'm very concerned for some of the smaller people that we have on the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=135.48s)]
*  court. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=138.88s)]
*  We've got some small people. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=139.88s)]
*  Specifically women on the court today. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=142.2s)]
*  Women are very strong too. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  But man oh man is there risk for none other than Extra Emily. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=148.2s)]
*  Well we could say that but science is still out but I'm convinced she's made of rubber. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=154.6s)]
*  Very elastic maybe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=160.16s)]
*  And then we have the alternative of that which is Canute who I believe is so hard and brittle [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=161.16s)]
*  that any amount of force could potentially snap him just from the resistance he provides [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=168.04s)]
*  back onto that force. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=172.72s)]
*  And I do think when you take somebody like Canute who's extremely large, extremely strong, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  zero coordination and also doesn't really like women. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=180.84s)]
*  I think when you put that on the court today I think Extra Emily I think she's got to be [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  a little concerned. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  You can see him gesturing at her. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  Why are you even showing up? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=194.88s)]
*  You do not have to. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to a pulmonary recess. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=198.72s)]
*  And Canute somebody who is advocating for women not to play sports at all I think is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=201.8s)]
*  what I thought his last sort of take on the matter. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=206.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  So anyways Canute we're looking forward to seeing just how many steps he can take today. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday or not yesterday last week I believe he was up to somewhere of 120 before tapping [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=219.4s)]
*  out hurting his hamstring and heaving. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=224.32s)]
*  But last week is not the only week to matter guys. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=227.72s)]
*  We have another two bouts of athletic competition here coming up after basketball. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=230.28s)]
*  We have kickball on November 20th and then football on a date that has yet to be announced. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=236.0s)]
*  Kickball really sneaking up on us here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=241.2s)]
*  Is that going to play into the outcome of next week's match is the real question here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=243.32s)]
*  We're going to have some fatigued athletes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=248.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=249.72s)]
*  I mean and these are folks that exercise probably minimum two to three times per year. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=250.72s)]
*  Most of which is that during Camp Canute. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=255.76s)]
*  To go back to back weeks is going to put a physical toll on these unathletic bodies. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=257.96s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  I know I'm going to be in some of these matches Wake. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=266.4s)]
*  I'm going to be in kickball and I'm sure I'll be in football. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=268.68s)]
*  We'll have to see how it plays out Wake. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  Now many were calling you the unsung hero of game day football last year. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=274.76s)]
*  Real scrambler in the pocket finding your way into little you know nooks and crannies [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  crevices it was a master class in bobbing and weaving. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=283.76s)]
*  Well if there's one thing about me Wake I'm going to find the hole. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  That's what they were saying. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=290.92s)]
*  Right. And I do think that I was the MVP but I was robbed and I look forward to getting [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  back on the football field and you know finishing finishing the job that I started last year [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  and winning that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean it's too bad because you know you really you were right on that edge the whole time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=306.88000000000005s)]
*  People would say that you were finishing everywhere but you know sometimes the spectator doesn't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  really see all the finishing that goes on behind the scenes you know what's going on [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=316.84s)]
*  in the huddle you know a huddle that you were you know always at the top of in my eyes you [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  know drawing driving and just pushing your team into a position to win. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah sometimes yes go ahead Wake. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  No no no continue please. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=333.12s)]
*  I was just going to say you know maybe it's I lasted too long maybe I lasted too long [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=334.12s)]
*  and I was sometimes greatness too good for too long maybe I'll go a little quicker next [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=338.67999999999995s)]
*  time and maybe I'll win the trophy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=343.64s)]
*  Well speaking of time we have to usher in a little bit of the rules of the rules of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=345.72s)]
*  the day here guys we are playing a bout of basketball two teams of eight players will [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=351.08s)]
*  face off in four 12 minute quarters five players will be on the court at a time let that not [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=356.56s)]
*  be confused only three subs which means that their energy is going to be challenged. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  Normal baskets are worth two points anything within the arc anything outside the arc will [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=367.12s)]
*  be three points in total and free throws are each worth one point now whether or not we [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=371.16s)]
*  go with a hack a shack strategy is something that we're going to have to consider there [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=376.8s)]
*  we do have a bunch of uncoordinated unathletics sitters for a living going up against a couple [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=380.44s)]
*  of people who are candidly over six five so hacking a shack might be the only opportunity [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=387.24s)]
*  they have to really nullify that advantage. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=393.36s)]
*  Absolutely Wake the size is going to be a huge advantage here in the game of basketball [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=397.44s)]
*  I mean we all know that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=404.36s)]
*  Yep and remember that's vertical size horizontal size however less of an advantage we're going [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=406.36s)]
*  to have a very difficult time with horizontal with girth this is more of a length sport. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  It certainly is a length sport. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  Even with that said I'm excited to see just how many baskets we miss I actually have the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=422.04s)]
*  under on that it's going to be exciting and we are going to at the very least see a spectacle [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=427.16s)]
*  of friendship. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=437.36s)]
*  That's really what this is about. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  It is at the end of the day Austin it's about friendship and when you look at how that's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=442.24s)]
*  powered our first player today man oh man do you have magic in the air. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=447.6s)]
*  We have none other than Mr. Arthur. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Arthur famously friending everyone to his dismay I mean I mean both the men the women [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  are more of the women all the women who come on his stream people would argue that he is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=469.12s)]
*  becoming a friend maybe too quickly. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=473.92s)]
*  Is everyone's favorite cameraman. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=477.24s)]
*  I heard recently Valky responded to his tweet about a lover host or something like that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=480.24s)]
*  and he's never held a basketball in his life he was imported from Germany and I'm looking [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=486.24s)]
*  forward to see what he can put out on the court today. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=492.12s)]
*  One could argue you know he's risking it all right now continuing to play in game days [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=495.48s)]

*  Nick not a you know let's call him a novice when it comes to letting things slip through [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1484.48s)]

*  He's a 9 11 enthusiast. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1522.48s)]

*  He spends every morning he gets up religiously at eight o'clock in the morning and practices [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1529.3999999999999s)]

*  We can't discuss the reason for that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1545.9599999999998s)]
*  He will be put into at least 20 fan cams after this. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1548.4199999999998s)]

*  There's his armpit and he might ball out. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1555.6s)]
*  He doesn't get injured. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1559.1999999999998s)]
*  I do know what we have to say here of all the things I'm most impressed with so far [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1561.64s)]
*  in game day it was how long it took you to mention his armpit Austin that thing was just [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1566.92s)]
*  on display for a good 10 seconds there. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1571.12s)]

*  He started to show his legs. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1578.12s)]
*  He may be the true winner of today's game day regardless or maybe were the real winners [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1581.36s)]
*  of today's game day. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1588.5s)]
*  Yeah the Royal Wii. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1590.44s)]

*  Wake it's not me. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1593.92s)]
*  You know what I'm going to go ahead and we have word that it seems as if Hassan is Sonic [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1594.92s)]
*  we have Shadow his opposition none other than Cypher PK the ringer brought in to stop the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1602.1200000000001s)]
*  machine. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1608.84s)]
*  Cypher PK the only other person who is both tall and wide enough to potentially play with [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1610.2s)]
*  Hassan because you know most people aren't tall or wide. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1617.4399999999998s)]
*  Cypher PK is a real force in the low block. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1621.9199999999998s)]
*  He's able to really bang down low and create opportunities for himself. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1625.08s)]
*  Now this guy's an athlete I played game day with him and I played some football with him. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1629.76s)]
*  He's tall he's agile and he's got an intangible that a lot of people don't have on this court [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1634.24s)]
*  athleticism and I think yes maybe the kryptonite that will put his team over the edge. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1641.44s)]
*  I mean in a game where being able to run for more than 40 seconds straight puts you in [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1649.28s)]
*  a tier of athlete that no one else can even sniff being able to do so and have a couple [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1654.04s)]
*  driving layups in your toolkit. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1660.48s)]
*  Now that Austin that is a true asset truly excited to see just how many points Hassan [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1662.76s)]
*  and Cypher can score while everyone else fumbles around. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1668.96s)]
*  What an electric day of games what an electric day of games indeed. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1672.92s)]
*  Did I just use kryptonite as a good thing. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1678.2800000000002s)]
*  I believe you did Austin but man oh man that's all right. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1681.76s)]
*  It sounded really good challenge himself. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1686.76s)]
*  It sounded really good when I said it. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1689.24s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1691.44s)]
*  Yes indeed. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1692.44s)]
*  Well you know one could argue you know like armpits could be your kryptonite. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1693.44s)]
*  That's a thing that you like right. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1697.96s)]
*  That is that's true bad for you. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1700.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1702.84s)]
*  True. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1703.84s)]
*  And speaking of someone who only likes things that are bad for him let's talk about the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1704.84s)]
*  man who just keeps making things worse none other than an MP. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1707.44s)]
*  One could say he's an Icarus I say he is the sun the chosen one other than Nick Pallum [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1714.2s)]
*  ladies and gentlemen this is a Nick's event and he has structured everything to make him [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1721.76s)]
*  look good. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1726.78s)]
*  He really has. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1727.78s)]
*  He just lost unfortunately GTR. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1730.1s)]
*  He's a little poor today and he's most known for fumbling every woman on his lover host. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1733.18s)]
*  And the only goal he has today ladies and gentlemen is to put the ball in the basket [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1741.18s)]
*  a couple more times than comedy Russell. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1745.66s)]
*  So the bar is low. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1747.62s)]
*  He's learned from his mistakes. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1749.42s)]
*  Do not challenge people who know how to move their bodies to athletic competitions. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1751.8999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1756.02s)]

*  One could say and I don't mean the stakes that NMP law would rather be eating. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1763.3000000000002s)]
*  No no no I mean that the the consequences of loss are significant and that is that they [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1766.26s)]
*  will get made fun of for about half a day on Twitter. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=1773.16s)]

*  All right. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2199.26s)]
*  And how do you think NMP Law is going to do out there on the court? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2200.26s)]
*  You know, I love Nick. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2203.26s)]
*  You know, he's my client. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2204.26s)]
*  He's a good friend. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2205.26s)]
*  He's not clutch. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2206.26s)]
*  He's not. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2207.26s)]
*  He's struggled the last few years. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2208.26s)]
*  He earned that nickname. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2209.26s)]
*  I mean, he earned it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2210.26s)]
*  It wasn't just given to him. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2211.26s)]
*  He earned it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2212.26s)]
*  So that's the key today. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2213.26s)]
*  Who earns what? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2214.26s)]

*  My interviews are going really good. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2289.26s)]
*  I've just been digging into the depths of a little bit of this NMP LOL Extended Universe. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2290.26s)]
*  Oh, what have you learned? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2295.26s)]
*  Did Nick buy you any Versace bags? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2296.26s)]
*  He bought me absolutely nothing, Sierra. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2299.26s)]
*  So I haven't gotten a necklace. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2302.26s)]
*  I haven't gotten a bag, no car, not even a hug. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2304.26s)]

*  Do you harbor any resentment towards him? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2311.26s)]
*  No, not really, because at least you feed me food so I'm not hungry, so I can't harbor [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2313.26s)]
*  resentment if food is in my belly. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2319.26s)]
*  I've gotten really parasocial lately. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2320.26s)]
*  Of course. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2322.26s)]
*  I noticed on the unban request, I was hyper analyzing your body language. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2323.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2328.26s)]
*  What was going on there? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2329.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2330.26s)]
*  Were you uncomfortable? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2331.26s)]
*  Oh, my God, no. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2332.26s)]
*  I love when people say they want to come on my face. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2333.26s)]
*  So it was kind of like, oh, that's a nice unban one. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2336.26s)]

*  I saw how she nutmegged him the other day, so. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2417.26s)]
*  He didn't want to go against me again because he lost his soul. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2421.26s)]
*  He lost his dignity after that one. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2424.26s)]

*  Does anyone know how to play point guard? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2455.26s)]
*  Not foul aggressively, just like be able to bring up the ball? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2457.26s)]
*  Absolutely not, E. Rob. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2460.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2463.26s)]

*  I didn't want to have to pick him first pick, but E. Rob. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2479.26s)]
*  Is E. Rob good? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2483.26s)]

*  Robin Lulu. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2500.26s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2502.26s)]
*  That's crazy that not only you didn't get a double pick, but you also got two solid players as a pick. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2504.26s)]

*  Tech Tone, I don't want him to injure Megan. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2526.26s)]
*  We can do a trade, don't we? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2528.26s)]
*  That's probably fair. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2529.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2530.26s)]

*  Damn, bro, I want to play with my favorite streamer, man. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2538.26s)]
*  My man looks like he frequents Ohio gas stations. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2542.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2548.26s)]
*  It's my choice. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2552.26s)]
*  No, I just picked. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2553.26s)]

*  Go get Troy, bro. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2561.26s)]

*  This is going to be a massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2737.26s)]
*  That is, this is going to be a massacre. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2741.26s)]
*  This is not good. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2743.26s)]
*  The score is definitely going to be in two different directions here, Wake, with one [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2745.26s)]
*  scoring significantly more than the other. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2751.26s)]
*  That is, and that is how the game of basketball tends to work, Austin. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2753.26s)]
*  We have, I want to say three to four competent athletes versus one and a half competent athletes. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2757.26s)]
*  And that is not a favorable ratio. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2765.26s)]
*  Once that Tectone trade in, and I don't know what Cypher was thinking. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2768.26s)]
*  I don't know if he was trying to be an amenable GM, if he thought that this was a friend making game. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2772.26s)]
*  It is not. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2777.26s)]
*  You build friendships internally, but between teams, holy shit, what a fucking fumble that was. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2778.26s)]
*  I passed the ball to Tectone last game day and it literally ricocheted off of his shiny noggin. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2785.26s)]
*  He went like this and it hit him in the head. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2790.26s)]
*  And I never did it again. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2793.26s)]
*  I think what you're going to have to hope if you're Cypher's team is you're going to have to hope for injury. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2795.26s)]
*  And you're going to have to hope that Hassan Piker's older age really starts to play against him. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2800.26s)]
*  Because, you know, this is one thing I think we should consider Wake. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2806.26s)]
*  Look, he can shoot the ball. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2809.26s)]
*  He can dribble. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2813.26s)]
*  But his endurance experts have put that into question. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2815.26s)]
*  And I'm not sure he's going to last. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2819.26s)]
*  He might have his work cut out for him. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2821.26s)]
*  But I will say this when you consider opposition, it seems as if Hassan at the very least does routinely run and play basketball. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2823.26s)]
*  Something that interesting. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2833.26s)]
*  I hate to interrupt you here, but an interesting choice of Hassan Piker to go with sleeves and not cut them off. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2835.26s)]
*  The Clippers, the fan cams, they are furious. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2843.26s)]
*  I'm looking at Twitter right now. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2848.26s)]
*  The lack of armpit is going to really play against him today. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2850.26s)]
*  Well, when he undoubtedly goes to the sidelines and scrolls his Twitter community, we might end up seeing a change of heart. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2855.26s)]
*  Maybe that kind of midgame feedback loop could even spiral him. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2863.26s)]
*  I mean, one could say that that could wreak havoc on his sort of his frame, his well-being midgame. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2869.26s)]
*  You know what they say. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2875.26s)]
*  Confidence is everything. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2876.26s)]
*  And if he feels as if he's underperforming, maybe we see a mid competition shift. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2878.26s)]
*  Canute having his pre-game midgame snack right now. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2883.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2888.26s)]
*  He's expect. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2889.26s)]
*  I think if our sports scientists back in the lab suggest he's actually already expended more energy than the entire Chinese industrial scape, it's just this warm up. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2890.26s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2904.26s)]
*  He's holding at least 3000 calories in his left arm right now that he will probably eat before the game even starts. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2905.26s)]
*  Oh, and there's Julia getting right into the camera. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2911.26s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2913.26s)]
*  I tell you what, I'm excited to see her play. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2914.26s)]
*  I saw her perform. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2916.26s)]
*  This was a stipulation here. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2918.26s)]
*  Canute wasn't allowed to play unless he was well fed for risk of him actually eating the other smaller contestants. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2920.26s)]
*  And he is known to do that. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2927.26s)]
*  I took him to a convention one time, RuneFest. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2929.26s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2932.26s)]
*  He devoured those nerds. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2933.26s)]
*  It was not. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2935.26s)]
*  It was not a pretty sight. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2936.26s)]
*  He's not allowed. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2937.26s)]
*  It's a bad time to be a nerd when you're around Canute with a mustache. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2938.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2941.26s)]
*  Really bad. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2942.26s)]
*  He tell you. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2943.26s)]
*  Eats them alive. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2944.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2945.26s)]
*  This is the color is he does. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2946.26s)]
*  He really does. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2949.26s)]
*  But I'm looking forward to this week. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2950.26s)]
*  I tell you, the athletes out on here on the field, the lack of athleticism, a combination. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2951.26s)]
*  Look at here. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2956.26s)]
*  We got Team Blue versus Team Red Hassan leading Team Red with athletes like BJP, Nick Pallum, Raffle Gator, Ms. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2957.26s)]
*  Kiff, Canute, extra Emily, Julia and Peach on the other team led by Cypher P.K. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2965.26s)]
*  We got Lulu, E Robb, Tectone, Dean. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2969.26s)]
*  So damn cool. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2971.26s)]
*  Russell, so to poppin Arthur and Mari. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2973.26s)]
*  Who do you think is each team's strongest athlete, Wake? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2975.26s)]
*  Well, what we have here is, you know, let's I mean, this is like asking me what the best car in the junkyard is. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2979.26s)]
*  We're really going to have to see what's salvageable at the end of the day, Austin. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2986.26s)]
*  But we do have, however, our stories. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2990.26s)]
*  We have narratives. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2993.26s)]
*  We have drama. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2994.26s)]
*  We have Arthur poised against his love, his one true king, NMP Lull. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=2995.26s)]
*  How's that going to play into the competition? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3003.26s)]
*  Also, for the first time ever, he's facing off against Nora, his competition in the game of hearts he's playing. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3005.26s)]
*  So now the question is, how does that play in to the actual conflict itself between these two teams? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3013.26s)]
*  We have Tectone versus Hassan, two people who, for all intents and purposes, should get along now having to play against each other in a game of basketball. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3020.26s)]
*  How's that going to tear at each other's hearts? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3031.26s)]
*  Yeah, who knows? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3034.26s)]
*  Who know? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3035.26s)]
*  I'm really interested to see if these players can can hold their emotions together despite all these narratives at play and be able to put put together a full game from quarter to quarter. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3037.26s)]
*  I mean, I mean, you mentioned it, Arthur. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3048.26s)]
*  I mean, his heart being ripped out of his chest, having to play against his one true love, Nick, still beating barely and having to go out there and put out a performance. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3051.26s)]
*  I mean, I really got to give it to him for even showing up today. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3062.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3066.26s)]
*  Speaking of still beating, whether or not Nick is still beating is a big part of this. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3067.26s)]
*  Is he full sack or not showing up empty sack? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3071.26s)]
*  Maybe he loses a bit of that athletic edge, but has a bit more clarity, sees the court a little bit better, maybe makes those passes he needs to make. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3074.26s)]
*  But is he going to be a killer around the basket? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3081.26s)]
*  Now we don't know. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3083.26s)]
*  Is Mr. Arthur's heart still beating? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3085.26s)]
*  Is Nick still beating his meat? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3087.26s)]
*  Is Tech Tone still beating the allegations? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3089.26s)]
*  You know, there are so many things to bring up here. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3092.26s)]
*  Is Rob probably still beating his meat? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3095.26s)]
*  Man, is he in VRChat? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3099.26s)]
*  We have a lot of things to consider play by play here. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3100.26s)]
*  I think the biggest blunder made and I stand by this. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3104.26s)]
*  This is going to decide the entire match. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3106.26s)]
*  Is Nick still beating his meat? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3108.26s)]
*  I do want to say that I want to see Tech Tone make changes here. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3110.26s)]
*  I want to see him show that he's got that reach and really dominate the backboards. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3113.26s)]
*  But man, oh man, do they have a real twin tower offensive between him and Rob. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3117.26s)]
*  Rob was an MVP of Game Day basketball in 2022. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3121.26s)]
*  That is a huge accolade that we have just not considered because he missed 2023 due to injury. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3125.26s)]
*  You know, I think that's a huge accolade. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3131.26s)]
*  It's too tragic to me. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3133.26s)]
*  It's too tragic. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3134.26s)]
*  So we'll have to see how it all plays out. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3135.26s)]
*  But those are the big players. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3137.26s)]
*  It's the Rob v Tech Tone matchup going head to head. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3138.26s)]
*  A clash of Titans who comes out on top is going to determine tonight's game. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3141.26s)]
*  Now you're a real masturbator, Wake. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3145.26s)]
*  I try to be. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3148.26s)]
*  Now, if you're here, would you empty the sack before the game or would you keep it together? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3149.26s)]
*  Because if you empty the sack before the game, you're going to be the last one to get the sack. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3156.26s)]
*  Would you keep it on before the game or would you keep it together? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3161.26s)]
*  Because if you empty it, more clarity, but you keep it on more testosterone. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3164.26s)]
*  So what you do is you actually progressively edge throughout the game. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3168.26s)]
*  So you take tactical timeouts, maybe even group up as a team to kind of pull that testosterone. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3172.26s)]
*  It's sort of a tribal ceremony of sorts. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3178.26s)]
*  You know, being in communion with your brothers and your sisters, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3181.26s)]
*  See the clarity in that sort of, you know, erotic fog is what I'd like to see. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3186.26s)]
*  So how do you fight through that fog and put yourself in a position to see clearly? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3192.26s)]
*  Despite that, that's where champions are made. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3197.26s)]
*  Austin, it's right on the edge, right? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3199.26s)]
*  Right on the edge. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3201.26s)]
*  Wake and speaking. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3202.26s)]
*  Oh, go ahead. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3204.26s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3205.26s)]
*  I think you know where I'm going with this. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3206.26s)]
*  I think you know where I'm going. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3207.26s)]
*  I think folks is ready to start. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3209.26s)]
*  I think we're ready to play some basketball. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3210.26s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3213.26s)]
*  We are. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3214.26s)]
*  It is game day time. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3215.26s)]
*  Let's go ahead and have our man on the court, Vincent Sear, take it away. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3217.26s)]

*  We got a lot of tall people. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3242.26s)]
*  We got a lot of strong people. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3243.26s)]

*  Do streamers make too much money? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3250.26s)]
*  Should they be taxed 95 percent? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3253.26s)]
*  Should their ad revenue be cut? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3256.26s)]
*  These are questions that I've been asking other streamers out here today on the court. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3259.26s)]
*  It's just been a wild day for a lot of us, especially with Hassan here and everything that he's done. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3265.26s)]
*  It's just insane. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3271.26s)]
*  And the tension between TechTone and Hassan, just wild. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3272.26s)]
*  I think they might fight on the court today. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3279.26s)]
*  Now, I've been told to stall for a second, so I'm going to proceed to do that right now. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3281.26s)]

*  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3691.26s)]
*  That the red glare, and the bursting in air [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3695.26s)]
*  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3701.26s)]
*  O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3710.26s)]
*  of the land of the free, the land of the free, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3721.26s)]
*  and the home of the brave. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3733.26s)]
*  High ball! [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3740.26s)]
*  Oh, this doesn't work. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3741.26s)]
*  Now there you have it. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3752.26s)]
*  I want you to understand I wasn't associated with that in any way whatsoever. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3753.26s)]
*  I'm just the host. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3756.26s)]
*  I stand offside. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3757.26s)]
*  I do this. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3758.26s)]
*  And I'm going to be sending it back to Wake and Austin. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3759.26s)]
*  I would love to hear what they think about this. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3761.26s)]
*  Guys, how you doing over there? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3763.26s)]
*  Man, oh man. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3764.26s)]
*  The real question, Vincent, is what's going to be more on Twitter? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3765.26s)]
*  If there was any doubt here on the broadcast, we are true American patriots. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3800.26s)]
*  Red-blooded American patriots. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3806.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3808.26s)]
*  And we... [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3809.26s)]
*  God-honest American patriots. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3810.26s)]
*  We do not represent Hassan Piker not knowing the words to our dear national anthem. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3811.26s)]
*  I'm going to be honest. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3817.26s)]
*  I'm actually shocked that I think only three people knew the words. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3818.26s)]
*  I'm shocked as well. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3822.26s)]
*  That is... [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3823.26s)]
*  If you want more evidence of how little sports any of these people have watched, it's the [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3824.26s)]
*  fact that none of them know the Star Spangled Banner. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3827.26s)]
*  Because that's the only time you hear it. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3829.26s)]
*  That's it, folks. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3830.26s)]
*  So we have an absence of game tape watch. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3831.26s)]
*  We have an absence of shots taken. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3834.26s)]
*  We have an absence of athletic acumen. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3836.26s)]
*  We have an absence of social awareness. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3839.26s)]
*  But man, oh man, do you want to know what we have a surplus of, Austin? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3841.26s)]
*  What is that Wake? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3844.26s)]
*  A fart. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3846.26s)]
*  Man, do these players want to make it? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3847.26s)]
*  Make it what? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3850.26s)]
*  About themselves. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3851.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3852.26s)]
*  We're going to have everyone scratching head over foot, fist after fist, clawing atop one [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3853.26s)]
*  another to be at the very top of this mountain, the mountain of streamer. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3861.26s)]
*  Everybody is going to be clawing at one another, looking for that next top clip. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3866.26s)]
*  Isn't that right, Wake? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3872.26s)]
*  Man, oh man, are they ever. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3873.26s)]
*  We have a great deal of farming happening here today, and we look forward to seeing [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3875.26s)]
*  how that plays out in real time. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3880.26s)]
*  I'm going to be honest here, Hassan looking to be the only person who can make a basket, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3882.26s)]
*  much to the dismay of all of half of Twitter. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3887.26s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see how that plays out here. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3890.26s)]
*  He's actually taking a warm up seriously, and it seems like he can use his left hand, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3893.26s)]
*  which is not looking good for the blue team. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3898.26s)]
*  The blue team's key to victory today is probably going to be to just throw Russell at [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3902.26s)]
*  Hassan and hope that that's enough of a roadblock to keep him in place. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3907.26s)]
*  Hassan's going to have to bust out the pokey flute if he wants to make that bolder move. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3912.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3916.26s)]
*  Bold choice for Hassan to wear those pink shorts. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3918.26s)]
*  My God, not beating the queer allegations at all with that one. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3922.26s)]
*  Well, you know, it depends on where you're looking. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3926.26s)]
*  You know, from up top, he's a good old fashioned Republican. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3929.26s)]
*  You know, below the waist, now he's having fun, which was probably his design [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3932.26s)]
*  and probably his desired aesthetic. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3936.26s)]
*  That's very, very, very true. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3938.26s)]
*  I'm hearing from the bench that Tectone's already called him gay. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3942.26s)]
*  It must be one of his strategies. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3947.26s)]
*  Oh, no, he was just saying it generally. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3949.26s)]
*  It's kind of an R.A. emanates of, by the way, that's gay and I'm not is what that means. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3952.26s)]
*  I see. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3957.26s)]
*  A couple of things that are gay, pole dancing, pink leopard shorts. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3958.26s)]
*  You want to know what's not gay? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3961.26s)]
*  Big anime tits, dude. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3963.26s)]
*  I tell you what, dude. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3965.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3966.26s)]
*  I do look forward to seeing, though, how the spirit of competition takes over Tectone today. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3967.26s)]
*  I really do think we have an interesting narrative, almost a battle of ideologies here. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3972.26s)]
*  It's going to be fun to see how this all plays out as it should on the basketball court, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3976.26s)]
*  which I do believe was actually the proposed method of determining the 2024 presidential election. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3980.26s)]
*  Rumor has it that Kamala just didn't have the crossover, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3985.26s)]
*  and that's why she actually dip dodged and evaded that outcome. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3988.26s)]
*  It's going to be tough to see here today, but we actually are going with Cypher Pique on the jump ball. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3993.26s)]
*  An unprecedented maneuver. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=3999.26s)]
*  I was expecting they'd throw Tectone there, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4000.26s)]
*  but it seems they're going for that leaping ability there at the center court. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4002.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4006.26s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4008.26s)]
*  Austin knows so much about basketball. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4009.26s)]
*  He decided he was going to test me and see what I know about basketball today in a play by play commentary. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4011.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4017.26s)]
*  You might be hearing. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4018.26s)]
*  I played professionally, Wake. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4019.26s)]
*  I did. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4021.26s)]
*  A little known thing about Austin, he was actually a real terror in the Turkish minor leagues, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4022.26s)]
*  really made the rounds. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4029.26s)]
*  He, however, just didn't necessarily have the verticality to make it to the next level there. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4031.26s)]
*  He was really kind of playing a little bit lower than the rest, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4038.26s)]
*  finding his way into those holes that we were talking about, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4043.26s)]
*  and it turns out they really don't like that there. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4047.26s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4049.26s)]
*  Seems like they've got Raffelgater on the jump ball. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4050.26s)]
*  Hassan Pique, oh, he's already down with an injury, Wake. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4053.26s)]
*  Oh, no, he's just tying his shoe. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4056.26s)]
*  Oh, he's just tying his shoe. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4057.26s)]
*  It's a shoe. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4058.26s)]
*  Oh, he's just tying his shoe. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4059.26s)]
*  I thought he was already injured. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4060.26s)]
*  Hassan Pique rocking the Kyrie Irvings there as a show of strength for his brothers in ideology, I think. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4061.26s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4068.26s)]
*  All right, the camera's on him, so I guess we got to talk about him. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4072.26s)]
*  Look at that haircut. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4075.26s)]
*  I mean, this is just look at the OK. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4076.26s)]
*  And, you know, you could see the other finasteride. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4079.26s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4083.26s)]
*  I mean, they're holding on for dear life for the last five years, not going anywhere. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4084.26s)]
*  Not at all, man. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4090.26s)]
*  What? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4093.26s)]
*  And man, I'll tell you what, man, how many seconds does it take that man to tie a shoe? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4094.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4098.26s)]
*  I really don't know. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4099.26s)]
*  I don't think they teach him how to. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4100.26s)]
*  He's been down there for quite some time. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4102.26s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4104.26s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4105.26s)]
*  Oh, he can barely find a shoe that fits him. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4106.26s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4109.26s)]
*  Oh, he's have. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4110.26s)]
*  Oh, he tied it. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4111.26s)]
*  He tied himself into a knot. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4112.26s)]
*  And now he's got to untie it. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4114.26s)]
*  I mean, look, if you can't tie a shoe wake, how are you supposed to go out and win the game today? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4115.26s)]
*  Due to the ravages of socialism, he was unable to buy shoelaces that work. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4123.26s)]
*  This is the world Hassan Piker wants, one where there are no shoelaces that work. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4128.26s)]
*  There are no shoelaces to keep the shoe bound to the floor. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4133.26s)]
*  Let's get a zoom in on that. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4136.26s)]
*  I'm curious. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4138.26s)]
*  Is he going to is he still up? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4139.26s)]
*  There he goes. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4140.26s)]
*  OK, I don't know what he was doing. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4141.26s)]
*  But what the hell is he wearing on his knees? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4142.26s)]
*  I think he's wearing a sexy little G string around the knee to and cyber. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4145.26s)]
*  He came with the jump ball immediately getting it to EROB 2 to 1, who passes it to EROB soda to EROB EROB to no one. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4151.26s)]
*  And we have raffle gator on the boards. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4159.26s)]
*  He's going to be the real key to victory. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4161.26s)]
*  BJP playing an old man's game. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4163.26s)]
*  Really going slow. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4165.26s)]
*  And he's all from deep. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4166.26s)]
*  Man, oh man, are we fumbling the basketball there. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4170.26s)]
*  And he's showing he's willing to pull up from deep and hit rim. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4173.26s)]
*  Actually pretty pretty dangerous display of competence there. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4176.26s)]
*  Robin, the low block, dishing it out to Hassan Piker, who takes a solid three point shot. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4181.26s)]
*  And again, Hassan. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4189.26s)]
*  Oh, running out once more, Nora collecting that rebound and trying to find a way into the basket. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4192.26s)]
*  Man, oh man, is this just a massacre on the boards? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4199.26s)]
*  BJP showing that shiftiness with a little bit of a floater and EROB coming up with a rebound. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4202.26s)]
*  Man, that rims getting a lot of attention today, Wake. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4210.26s)]
*  Oh man, and if a rim's getting attention, Austin knows about it. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4214.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4219.26s)]
*  Cypher, nil nil here. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4221.26s)]
*  Zero point scored on 42 shots. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4226.26s)]
*  EROB 2-2-1 coming away with the first two points. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4228.26s)]
*  First two points of the day, which is a shock. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4232.26s)]
*  Cypher threading that needle with the assist. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4235.26s)]
*  And look at that form, shooting right from the belly button, just like they teach you. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4238.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker showing some frustration on the court. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4245.26s)]
*  Oh, what the hell was that? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4250.26s)]
*  Dean so far from the ball. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4252.26s)]
*  Cypher PK really just launching that one into orbit here. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4254.26s)]
*  And we're already starting to see fatigue set in. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4257.26s)]
*  Raffelgater looking like he just finished round three with a VR cat girl in the strip club. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4259.26s)]
*  Now look, this is Hassan Piker's Super Bowl. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4264.26s)]
*  This is what he's been training for. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4267.26s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure on him to show up and show out. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4269.26s)]
*  I'd say he can't just win. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4272.26s)]
*  He's got to win big. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4275.26s)]
*  Look with the shot, with the three, Hassan Piker, and he missed it. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4276.26s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4280.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker's doing more for the blue team than he did all election season right now. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4281.26s)]
*  And EROB coming up with yet another rebound. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4290.26s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4292.26s)]
*  They are just terrorizing the boards. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4293.26s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4298.26s)]
*  This has got to be the lowest basketball scoring game in history, Wake. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4300.26s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4305.26s)]
*  Expect a lot of attempts and not a lot of shots. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4306.26s)]
*  What a great pass there from Cypher to absolutely no one. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4308.26s)]
*  And BJP really showing what it means to keep the pace up. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4315.26s)]
*  Nora with a solid take there, but Cypher was just willing to hit a woman. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4320.26s)]
*  Man, we have had so many changes in possessions. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4328.26s)]
*  You'd think this was a soccer match. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4331.26s)]
*  No, literally. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4332.26s)]
*  And the score reflects that, Wake. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4334.26s)]
*  It's two-nothing. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4336.26s)]
*  We've been playing for two minutes. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4337.26s)]
*  It is. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4339.26s)]
*  I believe we had more goals scored in soccer at this point than we have in basketball. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4340.26s)]
*  Tech-Tone really just traveling more than he ever plans to in his life. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4344.26s)]
*  We have, throwing on the breaks, Nick Pallum finding Hassan Piker there, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4349.26s)]
*  who gives a no-look pass to BJP. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4354.26s)]
*  And he's going to go ahead and use the body, take it into the center to no avail. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4357.26s)]
*  Seems like he's taking his anger out on that backboard, Wake. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4361.26s)]
*  Oh, yes, indeed he is. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4365.26s)]
*  And Dean with a long shot hitting rim. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4368.26s)]
*  He missed that, but he looked good, didn't he? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4372.26s)]
*  And it looks like Soda was going for a classic 2016 Soda maneuver, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4375.26s)]
*  just kind of clobbering that woman. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4380.26s)]
*  Tech-Tone launching to a good pass to Erobs, going to shoot from three. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4385.26s)]
*  Not scoring again. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4390.26s)]
*  This, we might be approaching a world record for shot attempts without a basket at this point. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4393.26s)]
*  Hassan trying to do something about it, and he cannot, ladies and gentlemen. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4401.26s)]
*  And he breaks the cold streak. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4406.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker shooting one for 482 tonight. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4409.26s)]
*  Yeah, man, I tell you what, it's not a good ratio, but he got it done, Wake. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4413.26s)]
*  He put those points on the board. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4417.26s)]
*  And now we're all tied up at two. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4419.26s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4421.26s)]
*  You can just see on their faces right now, this is Blue Team's 9-11. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4422.26s)]
*  And man, did they deserve it. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4426.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4429.26s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4430.26s)]
*  With a three-pointer, who was that, Wake? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4432.26s)]
*  I believe that was none other than Cypher Piker showing why he's a captain here. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4436.26s)]
*  Adding that three-point shot into his arsenal this season, Hassan looking to return, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4441.26s)]
*  an eye for an eye, does not make the world blind because this eye is not getting hit. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4446.26s)]
*  He can't shoot. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4451.26s)]
*  He can't. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4452.26s)]
*  Something's off about him today. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4453.26s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4454.26s)]
*  Cypher with a little bit of a pump fake, tries to drive down through baseline to no avail there. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4457.26s)]
*  We have Dean Socool being so chill with the ball. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4462.26s)]
*  BJP, an absolute pass on the defensive end. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4465.26s)]
*  And Erob fumbling yet again, doing what he's made to do, failing spectacularly. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4468.26s)]
*  BJP's going to take the ball down once more. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4478.26s)]
*  I tell you what, look at BJP dribble the ball. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4481.26s)]
*  You could tell he was an athlete. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4483.26s)]
*  Oh man, if you got him 48 years ago, you could know he'd be a real menace. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4486.26s)]
*  Oh, I tell you what, yes he would. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4491.26s)]
*  Canute donning the color he so chooses there, the man in red. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4494.26s)]
*  What does he have in store for us today? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4501.26s)]
*  Well, probably a good deal of snacks. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4503.26s)]
*  Mr. Arthur checking in as a Linity, it seems. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4506.26s)]
*  Linity, unable to make it. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4509.26s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4513.26s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4515.26s)]
*  Lulu Lovely checking in as well. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4518.26s)]
*  Lulu going to go ahead and inbound the ball to Erob. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4520.26s)]
*  Erob taking the ball back down once more. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4523.26s)]
*  Now what do we think of that haircut, Austin? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4525.26s)]
*  You know, for him I think it fits. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4528.26s)]
*  Yep, it is a solid Chris Brown cosplay, I agree. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4535.26s)]
*  Mr. Arthur fighting Russell who's going to shoot every shot, let me tell you. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4540.26s)]
*  Expect from Russell a barrage of three-point attempts saying, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4545.26s)]
*  please don't look at me, I'm not a threat, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4549.26s)]
*  until he drains maybe one in the final buzzer after 42 attempts. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4552.26s)]
*  Now you look at the roster, Wake, as Hassan Piker drives the ball for a two-point shot, and he makes it! [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4556.26s)]
*  Oh, he's got red team's only points today, bringing the game within one point. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4562.26s)]
*  Now let's go ahead here and check that replay there. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4566.26s)]
*  Hassan doing a tactical little heel click at the end saying, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4568.26s)]
*  don't look at me, I'm just a cute dainty little princess making my cute dainty little shot. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4571.26s)]
*  He looked sweet, he looked savory, and man oh man is Twitter talking about it. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4578.26s)]
*  And a no-look floater pass? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4583.26s)]
*  Hassan working the low block again, finding rim, and failing. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4587.26s)]
*  That's okay though because we are four points there on the red team, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4594.26s)]
*  two shots made on what I believe to be north of 50 attempts. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4599.26s)]
*  Now for somebody who doesn't like the rim, Hassan Piker sure is finding it a lot. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4603.26s)]
*  Oh man, oh man, isn't that the case though for those who so boldly say they hate the rim? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4608.26s)]
*  So true, so true. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4613.26s)]
*  Look at Knute. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4616.26s)]
*  Speaking of people who hate the rim, we've got Knute. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4617.26s)]
*  God, Knute with a basketball, it's like a walking oxymoron, look at that. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4620.26s)]
*  Knute moving around like the hunchback from 300. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4627.26s)]
*  There it is, he's going to go for a swipe, doesn't get it. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4635.26s)]
*  E-Rob chucking, a great pass to Knute there, he's going to go ahead and take the ball up court. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4639.26s)]
*  Oh, finding the thread there to extra Emily, Hassan with great vision on the floor. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4644.26s)]
*  Emily however saying, we want to make this a close game, don't pass it to me yet. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4649.26s)]
*  Lulu dribbling with both hands as they teach you in school. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4659.26s)]
*  Cypher PK. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4663.26s)]
*  The first quarter is coming close to an end here with three minutes left, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4666.26s)]
*  and we have, the score is five to four. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4671.26s)]
*  This has got to be a record. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4674.26s)]
*  You know, it's a record and a great pass there from Cypher. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4677.26s)]
*  Russell gets his own rebound after nailing the side of the backboard. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4682.26s)]
*  Russell now in contention for top scoring athlete in Game Day Basketball 2024 after one quarter of play. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4688.26s)]
*  Look at that with an alley-oop assist of sorts. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4696.26s)]
*  Russell really displaying his verticality there too. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4703.26s)]
*  Saying, I can't just run, I can also jump. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4707.26s)]
*  It seems though there might be a timeout being taken here. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4712.26s)]
*  Yeah, we have a stoppage in play. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4715.26s)]
*  Blue team is going to reconvene here as they start to get a runaway lead here. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4716.26s)]
*  Yeah, now wait, this is a shock because on paper here it looks like they're going to be taking a runaway lead. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4720.26s)]
*  On paper here it looks like red team would run away with this and it wouldn't be really even competitive. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4725.26s)]
*  But blue team is really putting a lot of heart out there. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4730.26s)]
*  So let's talk about what the scoreboard doesn't show. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4733.26s)]
*  There were a couple of important metrics here. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4736.26s)]
*  One are total shot attempts and rebounds. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4738.26s)]
*  And red team is far and away the winner of those two categories. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4740.26s)]
*  The problem is that man oh man, do they just love playing with the rim? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4744.26s)]
*  Just playing with it. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4748.26s)]
*  People say that if you're just playing with it, it doesn't mean anything. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4751.26s)]
*  That's right, they've got to start finishing. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4755.26s)]
*  They really do. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4758.26s)]
*  Oh, a great interception there from Robb. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4759.26s)]
*  He's going to go for a reach in there. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4762.26s)]
*  No call on that foul though. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4764.26s)]
*  Seifer going to go ahead and take it to the rack himself. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4766.26s)]
*  No luck. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4769.26s)]
*  Hassan taking that rebound and pushing tempo here. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4770.26s)]
*  Two and a half minutes left. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4773.26s)]
*  That sort of was a turnover assist of sorts there. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4775.26s)]
*  He's going for a little hook and he finds the basket. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4779.26s)]
*  I think Hassan is responsible for all his team's points at this point. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4782.26s)]
*  All six of them, Austin. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4787.26s)]
*  All six of them. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4789.26s)]
*  We have a real display of what I would call edging here, you know. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4792.26s)]
*  It's almost going in but not quite. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4798.26s)]
*  We call this the old Mormon standoff. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4802.26s)]
*  In basketball. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4805.26s)]
*  Pioneered by the Utah Jazz. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4807.26s)]
*  Oh, now we call it. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4809.26s)]
*  Now we call it. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4811.26s)]
*  Julia's getting a little mouthy with the ref, isn't she? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4813.26s)]
*  Pretty soon she's going to be screaming, twist his dick. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4818.26s)]
*  So fear not. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4821.26s)]
*  Miz playing aggressive defense there. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4822.26s)]
*  Looking shades of Gary Payton on him here. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4824.26s)]
*  They call him the glove. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4826.26s)]
*  And let me tell you something, it does not fit. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4828.26s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4831.26s)]
*  Therefore. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4834.26s)]
*  Miz going for an inbound pass. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4838.26s)]
*  Hassan looks a little winded. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4842.26s)]
*  A little winded for sure. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4845.26s)]
*  It seems like there's a little bit of discourse here about whether or not people are getting their touches in. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4847.26s)]
*  Hassan saying, I'll pass to you. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4853.26s)]
*  He's going to go for a three again. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4855.26s)]
*  And he's just not been lucky from that point in the court wake. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4857.26s)]
*  I don't know why he keeps doing it. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4860.26s)]
*  Getting a little greedy. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4862.26s)]
*  If nothing else, it just seems to be a sort of impulse there. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4864.26s)]
*  Maybe it has to do with just so much time alone in a room talking and talking and talking. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4871.26s)]
*  You're not aware of when it is you shouldn't shoot. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4877.26s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4880.26s)]
*  And another missed attempt. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4882.26s)]
*  As he makes his way down the court here. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4886.26s)]
*  Playing great transition defense there, but that amounts to a penalty, it seems. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4888.26s)]
*  Or is that a travel? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4893.26s)]
*  Which was it? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4895.26s)]
*  I believe I saw a twirl the hands there. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4896.26s)]
*  We're getting a travel call. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4899.26s)]
*  No, no, that is a non shooting foul. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4900.26s)]
*  Balls on the floor. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4904.26s)]
*  He inbounds to Mr. Arthur, who, man, fumbles harder than he has with all three of the women he brings on his stream. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4905.26s)]
*  Canoes turning a shade of reddish purple, it seems. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4915.26s)]
*  The hot American son gradually metamorphosizing him into grimace. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4920.26s)]
*  I like this milkshake. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4931.26s)]
*  Two seconds one. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4933.26s)]
*  Look at that move. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4934.26s)]
*  Hassan with a shot well after the buzzer. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4935.26s)]
*  And after an electric display of athleticism, we have a score of six to seven. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4939.26s)]
*  That is after 12 consecutive minutes of a live basketball. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4947.26s)]
*  We have scored a grand total of six buckets with one three pointer between the two teams. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4952.26s)]
*  I mean, it's absolutely electrifying. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4960.26s)]
*  The things that I've taken out of this performance by red team, shocking performance. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4965.26s)]
*  And I'd like to see them distribute the ball around the court a little bit more and quit going after the rim so much. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4970.26s)]
*  I mean, just off the rim, off the rim, off the rim. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4976.26s)]
*  It's time to put it into the net. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4980.26s)]
*  And boy, oh boy, if you don't want to take it from me, take it from a selfish top, enough with the rim. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4982.26s)]
*  It's time to get in the hole. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4989.26s)]
*  Am I right? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4991.26s)]
*  It's time to get in the hole. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4992.26s)]
*  It's time to get in the hole. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4993.26s)]
*  It's time to finish. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4994.26s)]
*  Enough talk. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4995.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4996.26s)]
*  Enough talk. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4997.26s)]
*  I'm going to be honest here. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=4998.26s)]
*  I was talking about keys to victory at this point now. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5000.26s)]
*  I think it's just outlasting the opponent. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5003.26s)]
*  I thought at one point this might be a matter of rebounds, but I actually think that the ball has deflected off of the brittle and flexible hands of these streamers so many times that E-Rob has found his way into more rebounds than any of these six six people on the court. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5005.26s)]
*  E-Rob actually showing that a drive to win is really all it takes. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5020.26s)]
*  A bunch of complacent streamers are really not doing much. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5025.26s)]
*  And look at Generous Tech Tone coming in with the snacks and beverages. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5028.26s)]
*  That's, you know, that's an interesting thing. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5032.26s)]
*  You don't see that that often. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5034.26s)]
*  He's going to pass those bottles. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5038.26s)]
*  Now, here's the deal. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5040.26s)]
*  You know, the ball hog strategy of red team may eventually pay off if Hassan Piker can heat up and start hitting some of these threes and some of these two, they could start to break away with the game. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5044.26s)]
*  But I mean, he's just got to get at least 50 percent of them. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5056.26s)]
*  I mean, at least 50 percent of them right now. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5059.26s)]
*  I think we just pulled the stats. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5062.26s)]
*  He's at a two to three percent shot to completion ratio. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5064.26s)]
*  And, you know, two to three percent is, you know, while we might say not great, I'll say this. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5070.26s)]
*  It's also leading. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5077.26s)]
*  It's leading right now in terms of efficiency on at least 10 or more attempts, which is an important metric here. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5079.26s)]
*  I mean, sure, you might have the odd Russell shooting 50 percent. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5084.26s)]
*  But at the end of the day, on two attempts, what does it matter? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5088.26s)]
*  You know, what is a high volume, you know, score doing here? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5091.26s)]
*  And that's what they're doing. They're shooting. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5095.26s)]
*  They're creating opportunities for themselves. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5097.26s)]
*  So we need the raw players to step up. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5099.26s)]
*  I want people nestling into the corner ready to shoot. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5101.26s)]
*  And, you know, I need to see some more Yoke Hitch like gameplay there from Rafflegator really drawing people into the post being a threat on the low block and then dishing it out to the shooters, BJP and Assan. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5104.26s)]
*  Well, you got blue team real grassroots effort to pass the ball around to conventionally unathletic players and just letting them shoot. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5115.26s)]
*  And looks like they're getting lucky. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5123.26s)]
*  Here's BJP bringing out the ball for red team. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5125.26s)]
*  If I've learned anything about grassroots efforts versus one charismatic man taking every shot he can and everyone he sees, it's that the latter wins. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5128.26s)]
*  They're going to have to pick it up. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5140.26s)]
*  We can classify that as a shot attempt. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5145.26s)]
*  Oh, and a big whip there. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5149.26s)]
*  Ero from the low block. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5152.26s)]
*  Fighting that once more. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5153.26s)]
*  Oh, man. Oh, man. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5157.26s)]
*  Looking like a fisherman the way he's playing with the net. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5161.26s)]
*  BJP says I'm going to take it into. Nope. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5165.26s)]
*  He's going to pass it to Assan who's going to finally find the net. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5167.26s)]
*  See, that's what I was talking about. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5170.26s)]
*  That's what I was talking about, Wake. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5172.26s)]
*  He's one for one in this quarter. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5174.26s)]
*  If he can continue doing that, he's going to score more points. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5175.26s)]
*  Now, see what we just saw there that really didn't come to fruition is Dean so cool. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5179.26s)]
*  I'm really trying to utilize a game, James Harden style game strategy. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5183.26s)]
*  And Ero fighting net again. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5188.26s)]
*  Is he a fisherman or what? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5190.26s)]
*  The way he's pulling up crabs. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5192.26s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5194.26s)]
*  And Assan Piker wants a three of his own and it's right off the rim. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5196.26s)]
*  And he rims out once more. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5200.26s)]
*  This could become lopsided real quick. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5202.26s)]
*  If Ero starts heating up from deep. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5204.26s)]
*  Well, I mean, what does that say about all of us? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5206.26s)]
*  Chance with his foot on the line there. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5208.26s)]
*  The hell was that? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5211.26s)]
*  Cypher Piker here with Chance. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5216.26s)]
*  Shoot again, Chance. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5218.26s)]
*  Chance maybe wants to take it from three. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5220.26s)]
*  And I don't know what that was, but it was interesting. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5225.26s)]
*  Choking to a cherry picking Nora here. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5229.26s)]
*  Nora went through on the board. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5232.26s)]
*  That is 10 to 11 blue team in the lead. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5234.26s)]
*  Wow, look at the vision there from Nick doing everything in his power [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5238.26s)]
*  to make life as easy for this woman as possible. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5242.26s)]
*  Man, oh man, is he a giver. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5245.26s)]
*  Dean with the three. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5251.26s)]
*  He only has to give her another 10,998 points before it's now even. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5253.26s)]
*  Canute's been very effective with the rebounds. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5258.26s)]
*  Canute going with the sort of walk. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5261.26s)]
*  What a pass from BJP. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5263.26s)]
*  Hassan not even ready for the vision on that one. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5265.26s)]
*  Oh, and he finds the rim yet again. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5268.26s)]
*  NMP Lall skating his way to that ball. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5273.26s)]
*  Not even able to get there fast enough. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5276.26s)]
*  We are going to alternate possession there. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5278.26s)]
*  Eropp's going to take the ball up one more time here. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5281.26s)]
*  Eropp just bobbing and weaving, you know. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5284.26s)]
*  Canute with a block, but it seems as though they're calling a penalty on that. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5288.26s)]
*  He did get a little bit of hand. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5292.26s)]
*  Canute, not familiar with the rules of basketball, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5294.26s)]
*  thought Eropp was asking for a high five. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5297.26s)]
*  But they got it with all five fingers? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5303.26s)]
*  Eropp rimming out there. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5306.26s)]
*  Let it be known, Eropp 2-2-1 without a jersey of his own. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5310.26s)]
*  No one planned for his attendance. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5314.26s)]
*  He brought the game day jersey. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5316.26s)]
*  BJP advancing the ball here down two. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5323.26s)]
*  Single possession, but it's still a game day. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5326.26s)]
*  Canute's got the ball up one more time. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5329.26s)]
*  BJP advancing the ball here down two. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5332.26s)]
*  Single possession game. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5335.26s)]
*  A total of ten baskets scored here. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5338.26s)]
*  See, this is what red team keeps doing, Wake. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5341.26s)]
*  They keep going for threes. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5344.26s)]
*  They need to drive the ball inside. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5346.26s)]
*  And do more of what blue team's doing. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5349.26s)]
*  Well, we have a problem, Austin. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5352.26s)]
*  And it's that I think everyone realized they don't know how to dribble. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5354.26s)]
*  So when they catch the ball, they have one of two options. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5358.26s)]
*  And they are going with a cherry picking strategy. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5362.26s)]
*  This is what Nick's team trying to deploy last game day to little success. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5366.26s)]
*  However, it seems as if they are able to even out the score here a little better than they had last year. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5370.26s)]
*  A bold strategy. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5376.26s)]
*  Norr's emerging as the leading scorer for red team. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5378.26s)]
*  And very quick, a quick change of speed here. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5382.26s)]
*  It seems as if she is. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5387.26s)]
*  You see how she just sloughed off on defense entirely here. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5389.26s)]
*  They actually have a wide open man. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5391.26s)]
*  Dean Sokol just needs to finish this opportunity. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5393.26s)]
*  But instead he passes it to the big man, Hassan Piker. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5396.26s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5399.26s)]
*  You'd think blue team would have an answer for this strategy and maybe put somebody back there on her. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5400.26s)]
*  But no, not at all. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5406.26s)]
*  And red team takes the lead. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5408.26s)]
*  They have indeed. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5410.26s)]
*  It should be 14-12 red here, I believe, unless I'm miscounting. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5412.26s)]
*  You'd think at the very least what they do is follow her when she sloughs off and just play 4v4. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5417.26s)]
*  But instead they have actually let this happen about three times in a row now. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5424.26s)]
*  Is the score not changing, Wake? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5428.26s)]
*  I'm not sure it is. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5430.26s)]
*  I could be miscounting. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5433.26s)]
*  There it is. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5435.26s)]
*  Don't forget, Austin, I'm a streamer. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5436.26s)]
*  My brain is soup. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5438.26s)]
*  Mine is too. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5440.26s)]
*  And Erob crossing up a 49-year-old man. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5442.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker, what do you bet he hits the rim this time? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5447.26s)]
*  Oh, and wow, with a generous pass there to Nick Pallum. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5452.26s)]
*  And here comes the rim. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5457.26s)]
*  Oh, man. Oh, man. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5459.26s)]
*  Does he just love that thing? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5461.26s)]
*  He really does. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5464.26s)]
*  He can't get enough of it. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5465.26s)]
*  Off the foot of Mr. Arthur, who I think is only ever played soccer. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5466.26s)]
*  And Hassan with yet another shot attempt to Noah Vale there. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5470.26s)]
*  And a great no-look pass there to Brick Pallum, who misses two quick shots in succession. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5474.26s)]
*  Make it three, and he's just repeating what he's doing in his personal life, baby. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5480.26s)]
*  Mr. Arthur, about to take it from deep, but he denies it. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5489.26s)]
*  Take a look here. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5493.26s)]
*  We have five red team members there at half court. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5494.26s)]
*  BJP picking that up. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5498.26s)]
*  Here comes BJP. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5502.26s)]
*  Visions of his younger years. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5504.26s)]
*  A couple solid no-look passes there. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5506.26s)]
*  Here comes a three from Hassan Piker, and it's the rim. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5509.26s)]
*  Man, he loves that rim. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5511.26s)]
*  He really does. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5513.26s)]
*  He's a fiend for the rim. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5514.26s)]
*  Oh, he's a fiend for it. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5515.26s)]
*  You know, I was reading that on Twitter. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5517.26s)]
*  Oh, me too. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5520.26s)]
*  Pretty, I assumed that, you know, they were just counting them out. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5522.26s)]
*  I thought it was haters. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5526.26s)]
*  Here comes Hassan Piker, and he's got it. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5527.26s)]
*  There we go. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5529.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker there. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5530.26s)]
*  There we go, and he looks good. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5532.26s)]
*  There you're staring right into the center of a fan cam, folks. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5534.26s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5539.26s)]
*  Watching him take flight and just crash into that thing has been inspiring. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5540.26s)]
*  Mm. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5545.26s)]
*  Looking like a real airplane. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5546.26s)]
*  Looks like we have a timeout on the field. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5548.26s)]
*  We have another tactical timeout here, about halfway through the second quarter here. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5550.26s)]
*  This will be near halftime. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5555.26s)]
*  We have a big shift in the margins here. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5557.26s)]
*  Red team really breaking ahead as they figured out the strategy of exploiting the absolute [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5560.26s)]
*  and unapologetic laziness of the game. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5567.26s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5570.26s)]
*  If one person just doesn't play defense, one, people for the most part don't know how to [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5571.26s)]
*  dribble or shoot, so you don't really have to play defense on them, and then two, it [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5576.26s)]
*  puts you in a position to get a free and open layup on the low block. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5581.26s)]
*  No one has exploited this strategy better than they are this year, probably due to, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5585.26s)]
*  well, just general apathy. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5590.26s)]
*  Good hoot hydrating. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5594.26s)]
*  You know, he's holding up pretty well, Wake. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5597.26s)]
*  You know, if nothing else, he's a real iron horse. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5601.26s)]
*  You know, he streams about 15 hours a day and, you know, walking up and down the court [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5605.26s)]
*  for an hour or two. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5610.26s)]
*  I mean, I think he's got it in him now. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5611.26s)]
*  I mean, this is a man that streams every aspect of his life. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5613.26s)]
*  Truly committed. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5618.26s)]
*  Man oh man is he ever. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5620.26s)]
*  Dean so cool. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5622.26s)]
*  So cool, man. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5624.26s)]
*  So damn cool. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5625.26s)]
*  So fucking cool. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5626.26s)]
*  So cool. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5627.26s)]
*  Setting up a block on Hassan Piker and then giving the ball back. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5628.26s)]
*  Cypher, he's got to need to take something here. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5633.26s)]
*  If he doesn't start shooting, he's going to be a pain in the ass. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5638.26s)]
*  He's going to be a pain in the ass. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5641.26s)]
*  He's going to need to take something here. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5643.26s)]
*  If he doesn't start shooting, Blue Team is going to just fall further and further behind. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5645.26s)]
*  Oh, he's going to learn his lesson about passing to Russell here. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5649.26s)]
*  Going deep to extra Emily. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5654.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker with the three and he's the rim. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5656.26s)]
*  Man oh man does he keep rimming. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5659.26s)]
*  Watch this guy's elbow. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5663.26s)]
*  Hassan rimming like he's practicing for prison. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5672.26s)]
*  And Austin, it seems like Chance has just gone with the beat the fuck out of a woman method. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5680.26s)]
*  Play me, play me, play me. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5686.26s)]
*  Something that I think we feared in pregame that we thought it was going to be carelessness, but it turns out just misogyny. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5690.26s)]
*  Hassan with a good shot. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5697.26s)]
*  That's two. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5700.26s)]
*  And Red Team is starting to break away with this. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5703.26s)]
*  Like I said, if they just got a little bit more. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5705.26s)]
*  You know, the problem here isn't, it isn't. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5709.26s)]
*  What we're seeing is that you have a de facto leader here in Cypher choosing to pass the ball to comedy Russell time and time and time again, as opposed to take the shot that he needs to create. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5713.26s)]
*  E-Rob. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5726.26s)]
*  Nick from the low block, Brick Pala with another miss. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5730.26s)]
*  You can tell the pressure is getting to him. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5734.26s)]
*  And you know, that's just what we would expect. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5737.26s)]
*  Letting it slip through his fingers once again saying, sub me out. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5740.26s)]
*  Yeah, he can't even take it. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5744.26s)]
*  He needs to be substituted. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5745.26s)]
*  Chance going to go ahead and scroll through his camera roll, looking for photos of A-Bay to find inspiration. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5748.26s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5755.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker looking for the three. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5756.26s)]
*  And he's got the rim. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5758.26s)]
*  Man, oh man. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5760.26s)]
*  That's crazy, he says, in disbelief. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5764.26s)]
*  I mean, that's almost comical at this point. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5767.26s)]
*  That's crazy, he says, marveling at the consequences of his actions. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5770.26s)]
*  Oh, extra Emily with that low block shot. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5774.26s)]
*  Canlulu lovely 2v1 this. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5778.26s)]
*  Tectone coming in ready to punch her. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5780.26s)]
*  Just swiping. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5784.26s)]
*  Send it back. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5788.26s)]
*  Yep. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5792.26s)]
*  Tectone. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5793.26s)]
*  Tectone used hyper voice. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5794.26s)]
*  It's super effective. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5796.26s)]
*  Hassan with the two. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5799.26s)]
*  And he's. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5801.26s)]
*  After almost two quarters of play, we are sitting at 30 combined points between two teams. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5807.26s)]
*  E-Rob dribbling like he's about to fall. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5815.26s)]
*  It's as if every step is just a way to stop himself from landing on his face. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5819.26s)]
*  Cypher taking that pass and getting an and one opportunity at the line after finishing on the low block. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5825.26s)]
*  A great turn of fates there. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5833.26s)]
*  For most people, I'd say that was a pass, but for E-Rob, I know he was shooting. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5835.26s)]
*  Cypher. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5848.26s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5849.26s)]
*  From the line. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5850.26s)]
*  And man, you know. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5851.26s)]
*  Here comes Hassan Piker dribbling the ball down the field. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5854.26s)]
*  And he's going to get. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5858.26s)]
*  Right off the backboard into the hand of Cypher P.K., who pushes tempo there to E-Rob 2-2-1. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5860.26s)]
*  E-Rob 2-2-1. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5866.26s)]
*  Man, oh man. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5868.26s)]
*  Oh, just really doing his best Hassan Piker impersonation now. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5872.26s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5878.26s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5879.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker dribbling the ball down the court. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5880.26s)]
*  And he's going to try to take it for three and he's got it. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5883.26s)]
*  And he finds it. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5885.26s)]
*  I think that may have been two though. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5886.26s)]
*  However, his foot wasn't aligned there. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5888.26s)]
*  That would count for two. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5890.26s)]
*  That's a long two. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5891.26s)]
*  A very long two right inside the arc. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5892.26s)]
*  They are up six here. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5900.26s)]
*  Dean so cool. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5904.26s)]
*  I don't know if the ball is in play or not. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5906.26s)]
*  All I know is that no one seems to care. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5908.26s)]
*  Lululubly kind of finding E-Rob. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5911.26s)]
*  But Mizkif really putting in the effort there. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5914.26s)]
*  And Knute one. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5917.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5919.26s)]
*  Knute missing on a great attempt there. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5922.26s)]
*  Tries to take the pants off of Dean so cool. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5927.26s)]
*  He said, show me your glutes. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5931.26s)]
*  Where are your striations, Dean? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5933.26s)]
*  I have to get you in the gym. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5936.26s)]
*  You've got the fat. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5937.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5942.26s)]
*  He's feeling hot after that three pointer almost three point shot. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5943.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker about to shoot again for sure. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5946.26s)]
*  And he's got the rim again. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5948.26s)]
*  And it comes up short. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5951.26s)]
*  Lippin' the rim that time. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5952.26s)]
*  Gave it a nice little kiss. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5954.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5957.26s)]
*  Strong opinions, tender love. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5959.26s)]
*  E-Rob dribbling like a 52 year old with the YMCA. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5968.26s)]
*  Here comes Russell with the three. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5971.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5973.26s)]
*  Now typically we'd say nothing but net, but today that was just nothing at all. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5976.26s)]
*  Here comes Hassan looking to get passes to Knute. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5981.26s)]
*  And a block by Seyfer Piker. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5986.26s)]
*  Knute with the rebound. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5993.26s)]
*  Two seconds left. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5995.26s)]
*  Oh, and he's not even going to try to. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5996.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5997.26s)]
*  And at the end of the first half, it's red team 20 and blue 14. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=5999.26s)]
*  Man, oh man. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6007.26s)]
*  You know, we often say that streamers, they have that childlike wonder. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6008.26s)]
*  You know, they have that childlike palette. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6013.26s)]
*  They have that childlike social skills. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6015.26s)]
*  And now today they have those childlike Little League gameplay numbers. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6017.26s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6023.26s)]
*  Making one shot on 182 attempts. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6025.26s)]
*  All of these streamers showing that they think about one thing, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6027.26s)]
*  which is scoring for themselves. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6030.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6034.26s)]
*  A lot of selfishness playing out. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6035.26s)]
*  You know, surprisingly, if we were to give a most generous award today, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6038.26s)]
*  it might go to TechTone for bringing his team water. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6041.26s)]
*  I mean, truly a shocking, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6044.26s)]
*  a shocking example of selflessness from TechTone with that. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6047.26s)]
*  I have heard from the Naismith basketball hall of fame, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6052.26s)]
*  as well as a number of esteemed voices in the basketball community [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6057.26s)]
*  that they are dubbing today, a dark day for the sport of basketball. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6063.26s)]
*  One of the most dismal and flagrant defenses to the spirit of the game [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6068.26s)]
*  they've ever seen. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6073.26s)]
*  And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is delaying his death only so that he might be able [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6075.26s)]
*  to see a better game of basketball than this. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6080.26s)]
*  I mean, look, I, I haven't watched a lot of basketball, as you can tell, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6083.26s)]
*  but I imagine it's a whole lot better than what we're seeing today. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6089.26s)]
*  Well, and I apologize to everybody who plays basketball [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6093.26s)]
*  for what they've seen today. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6097.26s)]
*  I look forward to hearing all the comments of I could wax these fucking idiots. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6099.26s)]
*  They're going to be everywhere. And man, oh, man, will they be entertaining? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6103.26s)]
*  You know, Austin, you haven't seen a lot of basketball, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6107.26s)]
*  but you have seen a lot of rimming and we have gotten great rim commentary from you. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6109.26s)]
*  And I like to think I put in my ad here, but, you know, I know where to defer. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6114.26s)]
*  And let me tell you, Austin, I think you've been excellent, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6117.26s)]
*  not as excellent as that mesh shirt, though. My, my, my, are you eating my food? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6120.26s)]
*  Thank you. Look, I, I, it was getting a little hot in here. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6124.26s)]
*  I decided to take off my other mesh shirt and put on another mesh shirt, wake. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6127.26s)]

*  Make sure you check out atomic picnic using the QR code in the bottom left hand corner [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6143.26s)]

*  Claws and chaos and excellent auto badler there that you can play. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6157.26s)]

*  And the OTK Games Expo, the Winter Games Expo will be coming at you on December 4th. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6168.26s)]
*  That's December 4th on OTK Network Channel. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6172.26s)]
*  Don't forget to check that out as well as Austin's nipples in that hot mesh shirt. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6175.26s)]
*  And Austin, thank you so much for doing that for us. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6180.26s)]
*  We are going to kick it out to another Stone Cold Fox, a real Tomcat in the sheets. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6183.26s)]
*  And let me tell you something, a menace on the hard court. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6188.26s)]
*  Give us some good interviews and some insights on the floor. Vincent Sear. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6190.26s)]
*  So damn shit, motherfucker. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6197.26s)]
*  Absolutely. It's really good seeing you guys here. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6201.26s)]
*  Now, what a match we saw. Blue down. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6204.26s)]
*  Look how exhausted they are over there. Can we get that? Look how exhausted they are. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6208.26s)]
*  It's just really sad. They are trying so hard, but they are really... [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6211.26s)]
*  Reds just chilling. They're relaxing. They're actually out here on the court. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6215.26s)]
*  Still getting that on. Now, I wish you could hear what Austin and what we're saying about you. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6218.26s)]
*  You are more wet than your mom was last night. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6222.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6225.26s)]
*  Now, listen, Austin's calling you the rim drop tomorrow. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6226.26s)]
*  What do you have to say about that? It looks like you've been going out there with some crazy plays. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6230.26s)]
*  I saw something. You ran over there. You went, boom, went swooping. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6234.26s)]
*  But sometimes you're just getting that rim job. Is that what you're working on right now? [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6237.26s)]
*  Yeah. So the problem is I'm not going to make any excuses. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6240.26s)]
*  Normally, if it goes in, it goes in, you know? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6244.26s)]
*  And right now, that's not what's going in. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6247.26s)]
*  You know what? You were going in last night? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6251.26s)]
*  You're digging my mother's vagina. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6252.26s)]
*  That is disrespectful to your own mother. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6254.26s)]
*  You're wet as fuck. This is it. This is a Burberry shirt. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6257.26s)]
*  What do you have to say? Is your team... [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6265.26s)]
*  You're wet as fuck is what your mom told me last night. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6266.26s)]
*  Is your team doing... That is incredibly unprofessional. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6268.26s)]
*  Is your team kind of going the way you want them to? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6271.26s)]
*  No, absolutely. So I'll say this much. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6275.26s)]
*  A lot of people had a lot of high expectations of me coming in here. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6279.26s)]
*  They're always going to dominate whatever. And I clearly have not done that. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6282.26s)]
*  But the only reason why we're up right now by six points is because of my team. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6285.26s)]
*  We have players playing appropriately, being in the right spot, very accessible. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6289.26s)]
*  I just dish it out to Nora, for example. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6296.26s)]
*  Nora played a major... That's really good. Those long passes. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6298.26s)]
*  When she's up there, she just goes, boom. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6301.26s)]
*  Yeah, she played a major role in bringing us back. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6302.26s)]
*  And, you know, BJP's fantastic. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6305.26s)]
*  Who's underperforming on your team? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6307.26s)]
*  Underperforming on our team? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6309.26s)]
*  Honestly, normally, there'd be someone I could make fun of, but everyone has done significantly. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6311.26s)]
*  So I'm the only one who's underperforming on our team. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6315.26s)]
*  I think that I've missed far too many shots. Sure, they're contested. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6317.26s)]
*  But I've missed far too many open threes. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6322.26s)]
*  I mean, I'm 0 for like 8 now on the three-point line. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6324.26s)]
*  And that's a horrible stat line that my chat is never going to let me live up. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6328.26s)]
*  I mean, I'm solving the Austin, Texas housing crisis. I heard with these bricks. I'm laying... Oh, my God. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6332.26s)]
*  I laid this pipe on your mom last night. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6337.26s)]
*  So, ladies and gentlemen, that's us on. Out there, Team Red, really living it up. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6338.26s)]
*  Let's get out here on the court and let's see how people are feeling. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6343.26s)]
*  NMP laughing out loud. I mean, your team is up. Hassan's out there. You guys got some good plays. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6345.26s)]
*  Those long passes to Nora down there. And she's just been sending it over and over and over again. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6352.26s)]
*  How do you feel about your performance today? [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6356.26s)]
*  Couldn't be worse, actually, Steve. I'm missing wide open shots. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6358.26s)]
*  I'm fucking... Every time I shoot, I hear Russell's black ass yelling at me from the sidelines. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6360.26s)]
*  You know, it is just not okay. I'm absolutely shook. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6364.26s)]
*  But Nora's playing great, which makes me happy, you know, because I flurred down her just for this so she could win. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6367.26s)]
*  So, super excited. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6371.26s)]
*  Why... Where do you think your lack of shots succeeding is coming from today? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6372.26s)]
*  Let me tell you what's going on here. I'm just serious. I'm not making shots because I suck. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6376.26s)]
*  There's nothing more to it. Every mistake that I have in life is my fault, my fault alone. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6380.26s)]
*  I have no one else to blame but myself. I'm a fucking loser. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6384.26s)]
*  But thank God I got good teammates to care for me through life and get this dub, hopefully. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6387.26s)]
*  We love to hear that. How do you feel about Hassan's performance today? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6390.26s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. I think he's missed more than I have, guys. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6393.26s)]
*  Do you feel like he's going to be as criticized as you are? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6396.26s)]
*  Absolutely not because he's tall and he's good looking. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6399.26s)]
*  Okay. All right. Well, we'll see you out there. Good luck on the second half. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6401.26s)]
*  I'm going to go to BJP over here. BJP. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6405.26s)]
*  How's it feeling out there? Is your team... [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6408.26s)]
*  From a coach's perspective, it's tough. It's tough to watch. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6411.26s)]
*  But, you know, it's a different kind of game. So we're getting used to each other. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6415.26s)]
*  You know, so we're coming along. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6419.26s)]
*  Is there teamwork? Is that happening? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6421.26s)]
*  There's a little bit. There could always be more. We're about one for 30 from the three-point range. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6423.26s)]
*  Hopefully we'll shoot a couple more closer shots. That's my coaching advice. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6426.26s)]
*  We'll see if they heed it. So they don't always listen. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6431.26s)]
*  I think you guys have had great ball control. The chat's so happy. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6434.26s)]
*  They're calling Hassan Rimlord. Rimlord. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6438.26s)]
*  What are they calling me, sir? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6442.26s)]
*  They're calling you the fastest bullet of Texas. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6444.26s)]
*  Okay. I'll take that. I'll accept that. I'll accept that. I appreciate it. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6447.26s)]
*  So they're loving you out there. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6450.26s)]
*  We have great announcers today, so I appreciate the announcing team. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6452.26s)]
*  You're very welcome. Yeah. You're very welcome. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6455.26s)]
*  Very professional. Way more professional than the players. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6457.26s)]
*  So we appreciate it. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6459.26s)]
*  We'll see what happens second out. Absolutely. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6460.26s)]
*  Who do we want next? Oh, Mizzi. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6462.26s)]
*  I'm not a fraction of that, but I'm unhappy with where I'm at right now. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6465.26s)]
*  I saw you do some crazy stuff out there. I feel like Joe Rogan. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6468.26s)]
*  I feel like you during your thing. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6471.26s)]
*  We saw some crazy stuff out there. You were down there laying down on the court. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6473.26s)]
*  I was. Rolling the ball. Yeah. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6477.26s)]
*  What made you think that? Was that a flight or fight thing? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6479.26s)]
*  No. I mean, I just got on the floor and started rolling around [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6481.26s)]
*  because I feel like, you know, when you are in it, you're in it to win it. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6484.26s)]
*  And, you know, my team is, like, really good and stuff, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6489.26s)]
*  and I'm really proud of everybody. Yeah. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6492.26s)]
*  It's really nice to watch this stream with no ads because the song's here. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6494.26s)]
*  So hope the chat is enjoying it. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6497.26s)]
*  He's going to fucking hit me in the... [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6500.26s)]
*  Look. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6501.26s)]
*  He has finally passed away, which is some of you will like and some of you won't like, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6510.26s)]
*  but his days are done. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6516.26s)]
*  That's it for interviews. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6518.26s)]
*  I wanted to only specifically interview the red team [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6520.26s)]
*  because they're looking good today. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6523.26s)]
*  And I think we're going to go into this halftime performance. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6526.26s)]
*  Peckys, how's our halftime performance looking for them? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6529.26s)]
*  Come on. Oh, come on. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6534.26s)]
*  Oh, well, it looks like you are mistaken. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6536.26s)]
*  There's no halftime performance. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6539.26s)]
*  It's just going to be Austin slowly disrobing for the camera. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6541.26s)]
*  And let me tell you something, guys. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6548.26s)]
*  We have had one hell of a bout. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6550.26s)]
*  A lot of fun being had here today. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6554.26s)]
*  We just saw Hassan Piker bludgeoning and drag his concubine, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6556.26s)]
*  Mizkif back to his chambers. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6560.26s)]
*  That will certainly make Twitch him boos. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6562.26s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6564.26s)]
*  Oh, that is definitely going to make Twitch him boos. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6566.26s)]
*  You've made Twitch him boos yourself quite a few times, Wake. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6568.26s)]
*  Well, gosh, I mean, I'm always wanted to be there. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6572.26s)]
*  You're way too humble. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6576.26s)]
*  You're literally the epitome of man. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6577.26s)]
*  Austin, Austin, if you want to, if you want to go blow for blow, your man, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6580.26s)]
*  I'm going to suck you off. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6584.26s)]
*  All right. Let's not start. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6585.26s)]
*  No, no homo. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6588.26s)]
*  No homo. I promise. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6589.26s)]
*  Speaking of no homo, we've got Tectone there. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6590.26s)]
*  Tectone really got to show us that verticality. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6592.26s)]
*  I think that he's been the missing link for his team, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6598.26s)]
*  and he's someone who I've really been counting on there on the low block. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6600.26s)]
*  I want to see more deflections, if anything. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6603.26s)]
*  We don't need rebounds. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6605.26s)]
*  We just need him to be a presence in the post there to take some little load off a cipher. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6606.26s)]
*  He took off the MAGA hat. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6610.26s)]
*  I thought he was going to wear throughout the game. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6613.26s)]
*  Well, you know, here's the thing. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6615.26s)]
*  Tectone understands that he needs advantages and being aerodynamic is certainly one of them. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6618.26s)]
*  All right. We've got an audio. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6624.26s)]
*  You're coming from the court here. Dean, so cool. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6625.26s)]
*  Go ahead and passing it to Bryce, who I guess is now playing. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6627.26s)]
*  What a concession from the blue team, who frankly is not very far behind. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6634.26s)]
*  Really only by six points. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6640.26s)]
*  But, you know, then again, that is kind of the whole game. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6643.26s)]
*  No one has scored at all ever. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6647.26s)]
*  Tectone just taking it from BJP there. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6650.26s)]
*  Finding Bryce again, who's going to go ahead and make a pass. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6655.26s)]
*  Bryce looking to make a pass again, showing a little bit of a shuffle there. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6658.26s)]
*  Fighting Mari there in the post and denied by BJP, who finds Noor on the low block again. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6663.26s)]
*  How have they not strategized around this? [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6669.26s)]
*  They had a whole half time to strategize for it and they haven't come up with an answer. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6672.26s)]
*  Tectone casting demoralizing shout there, seeing if he can maybe gaslight her out of scoring again. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6678.26s)]
*  Cypher really needing to show a little bit more offensive aggression there. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6689.26s)]
*  No luck there. He finds Bryce, who's going to go ahead and shoot that and he makes the shot. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6693.26s)]
*  22 to 16. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6700.26s)]
*  It's inside the three point line. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6702.26s)]
*  Pretty comfortably inside the three point line there. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6705.26s)]
*  He finds that. BJP finding Assan, who's going to rim out again. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6708.26s)]
*  And he's going to take one more, finding rim once more. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6715.26s)]
*  No, he finds net. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6718.26s)]
*  Look at that. Assan, cafeteria lady, Piker throwing on the net. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6723.26s)]
*  Tectone. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6732.26s)]
*  Oh, up and down. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6733.26s)]
*  A little up and down there, but I think they're just going to let it slide. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6734.26s)]
*  You like that wake? I knew what that was. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6739.26s)]
*  You did. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6741.26s)]
*  Oh, and Assan Piker is going to find the rim again. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6743.26s)]
*  Bryce looks like they're using a little bit of the Nora strategy. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6746.26s)]
*  And, you know, hey, if you can't beat him, join him, which is a strategy we've seen from a few people here on the court today. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6751.26s)]
*  And with the... [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6758.26s)]
*  Ooh, rimming out, but hey, it was in the right direction, which is pretty solid for this level of play. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6760.26s)]
*  If he takes another 42 shots, he might make a few. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6765.26s)]
*  Assan is at an interesting point because he needs to keep his team ahead while also redeeming himself. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6768.26s)]
*  Oh, and send it back. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6776.26s)]
*  Return to sender. That didn't have a properly denoted address. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6780.26s)]
*  Noor with a big miss there. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6787.26s)]
*  Brooke Pallam following it up. Man, oh man. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6788.26s)]
*  A lot has been said about Assan's misses, and what hasn't been discussed is that the only thing Nick has fumbled more than women is those low block shots. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6791.26s)]
*  And, wow. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6807.26s)]
*  Nick put it on a spin cycle, Bryce denying it. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6814.26s)]
*  Here comes Bryce. You know, really not making much of a difference here. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6819.26s)]
*  Red has done nothing but expand their lead from the first half. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6823.26s)]
*  We're going to go ahead and see Nick take that in with no real plan, do a pirouette, and then chuck it just kind of up. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6827.26s)]
*  Speaking of just chucking it up, I'm about to chuck up my lunch. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6836.26s)]
*  Eric, please stop. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6840.26s)]
*  Here comes Assan rim piker. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6842.26s)]
*  Looking for the rim again. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6845.26s)]
*  Living up to the name. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6846.26s)]
*  He's got it. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6847.26s)]
*  Bryce with yet another rebound there, fresh legs and a fresh mentality there. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6849.26s)]
*  He's finding an open site for P.K. who's going to go 2 v 1 and get stripped. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6857.26s)]
*  Man, shades of Muggsy Bogues coming out there from BJP, using his height to his advantage. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6861.26s)]
*  And a textbook lay in. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6869.26s)]
*  Put him on the line. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6873.26s)]
*  That's what I, that's it, that's it. They love a good sequence. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6878.26s)]
*  They go ahead and try to organize there on the line. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6886.26s)]
*  BJP is going to take a free throw here. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6892.26s)]
*  You know, I think he's going to make it, Wake. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6895.26s)]
*  You know, with how the free throws he's made his kids shoot, I'm sure it comes up just a little bit short. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6898.26s)]
*  And that has nothing to do with his stature. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6906.26s)]
*  Oh, man, look at the rebound there from BJP, man. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6909.26s)]
*  Here comes Assan. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6913.26s)]
*  And you guessed it. Oh, he got it. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6915.26s)]
*  Net there, 28-16, despite the addition of Bryce. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6918.26s)]
*  Man, oh, man, is this game just snowballing? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6923.26s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it really shocks me because Bryce is quite the athlete, not making much of a difference here, which goes to show you truly a team sport. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6927.26s)]
*  And Seifer gets the rebound on the offensive end, drives up the baseline and lays it in to no one there. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6936.26s)]
*  Miz with a solid inbound, but it ricochets off of Nora. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6944.26s)]
*  Yep, they're bringing in the secret weapon, extra Emily subbing in for their best player. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6950.26s)]
*  Seifer in the corner. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6960.26s)]
*  Knute going with the overwhelm them strategy and Erab, uncontested from the low block, finds Net again. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6963.26s)]
*  Shouting out football line calls here. Knute with the all rim. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6973.26s)]
*  Bryce taking the ball up court here, looking for an open man. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6985.26s)]
*  He finds Russell from deep. He lines up with a hell of a take, actually. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6990.26s)]
*  The closest I've seen Russell, textbook form, starting the shot from his crotch and releasing right at his mid, his solar plexus. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=6995.26s)]
*  And Lulu lovely, passing it to not so lovely. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7006.26s)]
*  Seifer PK, really working the low block there. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7013.26s)]
*  Miz Kiff doing his best, trying to enter them strategy. It does not work. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7017.26s)]
*  Seifer finds his way to the line. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7021.26s)]
*  Blue's really got to get something going here, Wake. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7030.26s)]
*  Erab, well, if by something going you mean a delicate pass to a big Norwegian man. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7034.26s)]
*  Knute trying to be as efficient as possible with his energy. He's just kind of hucking things so that he doesn't have to walk. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7041.26s)]
*  I go and play offense when you can stay on defense and turn the ball over. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7048.26s)]
*  Russell using that finesse, real light on his feet there. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7058.26s)]
*  Ballerino on his own right. Ballerino, apologies. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7064.26s)]
*  Here's Assan. Assan. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7070.26s)]
*  Trying to cross over like TechTone did. Knute putting on a block on TechTone. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7074.26s)]
*  And Bryce finding net there for two. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7082.26s)]
*  Finally making a difference for blue team. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7087.26s)]
*  See here, really taking that positioning advantage against Assan, exploiting his tired legs. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7091.26s)]
*  Oh, you know what it is? He took off his, no, no, his tendon bands are there. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7098.26s)]
*  Oh, another turnover. We haven't seen much of Pete. She's been invisible on the court today, Wake. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7102.26s)]
*  Either that or she hasn't even been in the game. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7108.26s)]
*  Mrs. Jars is famous for a couple of things, having played college tennis and her ass. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7111.26s)]
*  Unrelated points, but nowhere there is it mentioned making baskets. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7123.26s)]
*  However, what she is making is a great impression on the audience. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7129.26s)]
*  While people might not be seeing much of her, they are happy when she is on screen. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7133.26s)]
*  Assan Piker finding rim again from the low block. Can Russell play lockdown D? No, he can't. Finding net. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7136.26s)]
*  30 to 20. Assan actually showing his endurance here. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7146.26s)]
*  He is hobbled over and heaving, but my oh my, does he keep moving? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7150.26s)]
*  He's definitely having a better second half here, finding the rim less and less and getting more net. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7154.26s)]
*  Pete saying hello to her mother there. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7163.26s)]
*  Nick Pallum finding Knute who's going to take a shot and he's going to make it. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7167.26s)]
*  Feeling good Knute. Knute and Assan setting their differences aside. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7175.26s)]
*  Real modern white men can't jump kind of movie. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7181.26s)]
*  Oh, Tectone showing his athletic ability. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7190.26s)]
*  There it is, getting a solid deflection there. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7194.26s)]
*  On himself. Nick trying to triumph over Erab here. Can we get a shot from deep from Nick? [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7201.26s)]
*  Nick, that might be his best asset here. He has been known to, nope, he's just going to kind of drive and chuck. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7207.26s)]
*  No, what's the ruling on the floor there? It looks like it's just going to be a general turnover here. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7213.26s)]
*  You can see in the bottom left hand corner, Nick nimbly fumbling his way through before he just kind of heaves it up into the air like a toddler going underhand. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7217.26s)]
*  Seifer PK gradually metamorphosizing into Lord Farquaad here as that headband just rides up higher and higher. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7229.26s)]
*  And what a great pass to Dean. So ready. He's on the low block looking for the feed. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7239.26s)]
*  And look at that there, perfectly, perfectly arcing into Dean's hands there. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7247.26s)]
*  Vision from Seifer. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7253.26s)]
*  All alone. Man oh man. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7258.26s)]
*  Oh, that hurts Wake. She was all alone out there. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7261.26s)]
*  It would have been a 1v1 between her and Knute. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7265.26s)]
*  I haven't seen someone fumble a situation that comfy since Nick Pallum. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7268.26s)]
*  Seifer PK seeing if he can go make a difference here as we round out the end of the third quarter here. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7276.26s)]
*  Two and a half minutes, 32 to 22. Blue team really needing a change of fates and it's not coming. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7281.26s)]
*  Nick Pallum pressing tempo here, passing to Hassan Piker. Hassan bulldozing his way through Eric. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7290.26s)]
*  That was the best play of the game for him. He looked good. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7296.26s)]
*  Hassan is exploiting the bizarre metaphysics of EROB 2-2-1. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7300.26s)]
*  All of the negative karma and the weight of all of the negative things that have happened in the world are actually being absorbed by Eric, including Hassan's terrible shooting look. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7305.26s)]
*  He's starting to look a lot better in this second half. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7316.26s)]
*  If I'm blue team, I'm getting EROB as far from Hassan as possible. He should never be guarding him one on one here. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7319.26s)]
*  And you see there, same shot opportunities. He does not make them because EROB is not close enough to absorb all of that negative karma. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7327.26s)]
*  Hassan using all of his hands there and again shooting on Dean Sokol. He cannot make it. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7342.26s)]
*  EROB threading the needle there to Bryce. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7352.26s)]
*  Bryce showing his verticality there on the low block. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7354.26s)]
*  Now you put Bryce in the second half and the gap only gets wider. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7359.26s)]
*  Man, oh man, I mean one could say it's gaping. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7367.26s)]
*  It's right, it's gaping and then on top of that, red is hitting less rim. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7371.26s)]
*  You got a gaping hole and red is hitting less of the rim because of it. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7377.26s)]
*  Yeah, one could argue. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7384.26s)]
*  It's a mad situation. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7385.26s)]
*  I mean, it's like the hole is just getting wider and wider for them. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7387.26s)]
*  You know, the baskets just looking bigger and it seems like things are just kind of falling into it at this point. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7390.26s)]
*  That's right. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7395.26s)]
*  And Bryce with another basket. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7396.26s)]
*  Miss Giff taking it all the way to the low block there fighting Julia Kins who practiced shooting free throws all yesterday, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7398.26s)]
*  assuming she would ever shoot a free throw in today's game. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7406.26s)]
*  Cypher, 25 seconds left on the clock. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7412.26s)]
*  His team is down eight points. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7415.26s)]
*  They are going to need a heroic effort in the fourth year to even the odds. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7416.26s)]
*  He's going to take his time here. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7420.26s)]
*  He only got eight seconds. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7423.26s)]
*  Looks like he's just going to take a three point. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7424.26s)]
*  Oh boy, what a disaster that was, Wake. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7427.26s)]
*  What an absolute disaster and a reflection of the game that they played to this point. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7430.26s)]
*  That was awful. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7436.26s)]
*  Man, oh man, was that a mad situation. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7439.26s)]
*  That was awful. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7444.26s)]
*  Man, oh man, was that a mosh pit. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7447.26s)]
*  One thought we were playing rugby there for a second. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7451.26s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7454.26s)]
*  We had let me tell you something. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7455.26s)]
*  What an effort there from a really terrorizing that enemy defense there, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7458.26s)]
*  finding his way into their back lines and just hitting his shots there. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7463.26s)]
*  Oh, hitting it back to back to back. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7468.26s)]
*  No more rim. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7470.26s)]
*  No more rim, he said to himself. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7471.26s)]
*  No more backboard on that. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7473.26s)]
*  And that's what we saw in the second half. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7475.26s)]
*  Enough foreplay. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7477.26s)]
*  It's time to finish the job. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7478.26s)]
*  Time to get in there. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7479.26s)]
*  Based on the tape that we saw, Wake, that's what we would have expected in the first half. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7481.26s)]
*  It's funny because on one hand we were here assuming that maybe we were just seeing kind of like flagrant incompetence, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7486.26s)]
*  but what it was was that he was just a tender lover. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7492.26s)]
*  He wanted to make sure that the hole was warmed up before he really got in there. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7494.26s)]
*  That's right. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7498.26s)]
*  We got to give a tip of the hat to that. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7499.26s)]
*  We we love a good munch. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7501.26s)]
*  Yeah, we absolutely do. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7503.26s)]
*  And now that hole is gaping. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7504.26s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7506.26s)]
*  We're going to see blue team strategize there. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7507.26s)]
*  Bryce probably saying, please stop shooting. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7510.26s)]
*  Pass the ball to me and let me just keep taking low buck layups against these tired professional sitters. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7512.26s)]
*  They have not moved in years. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7519.26s)]
*  I play basketball every week. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7520.26s)]
*  Please stop shooting. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7522.26s)]
*  Give me the ball. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7524.26s)]
*  I will just shoot it. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7525.26s)]
*  Now, if you're blue team here, Wake, what are you doing? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7526.26s)]
*  If I'm blue team, I am well, one could say here the best thing to do would be to just have tech tone. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7530.26s)]
*  Stay on defense. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7537.26s)]
*  Don't run back to offense. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7539.26s)]
*  Don't fight for rebounds. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7540.26s)]
*  Just sit there at the low block and put your hands up. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7541.26s)]
*  We are not calling three seconds in the paint. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7544.26s)]
*  He could sit there the whole game. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7546.26s)]
*  Hands up. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7548.26s)]
*  Let Seifer keep running the ball up and down the court or honestly let Bryce take the ball up and down the court. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7549.26s)]
*  Let Seifer kind of be there to take low block layups and have Russell just try to kind of run into everyone, seeing if they can take out a key player. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7555.26s)]
*  You got to and you got to have an answer for Hassan Piker. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7563.26s)]
*  I mean, you got to get him back to the rim, right? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7566.26s)]
*  You got to get his head. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7568.26s)]
*  Maybe talk a little smack. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7569.26s)]
*  The real question is, is it possible? [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7571.26s)]
*  We're not sure. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7574.26s)]
*  So how do we get into Hassan Piker's head is the real question. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7575.26s)]
*  One could argue being a gray named chatter. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7579.26s)]
*  Perhaps if you can get him stun locked, that's what I would that's what I would advise. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7582.26s)]
*  If you're blue team, get him on a stun lock. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7587.26s)]
*  Start talking about hasn't Tecton hasn't even started utilizing his psychic damage move set. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7590.26s)]
*  He could just start saying things. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7596.26s)]
*  That's right. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7600.26s)]
*  He needs to he needs to go with the strategy. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7601.26s)]
*  Say that Kamala Harris lost because she didn't move to the right enough. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7603.26s)]
*  That would really get him out of his game. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7607.26s)]
*  That would really do it. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7609.26s)]
*  And we're going to go ahead and throw it down to Sear Sear. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7612.26s)]
*  Take it away, beautiful. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7616.26s)]
*  Oh, leaving you just like your father did. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7618.26s)]
*  He's coming back eventually, he said. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7621.26s)]
*  But don't wait up for him. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7624.26s)]
*  Sear America's America's absentee father. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7628.26s)]
*  Man, is he cool, man, is he sexy? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7632.26s)]
*  He really is. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7635.26s)]
*  He'll be back with cigarettes. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7636.26s)]
*  We're here at the start of the fourth quarter with red 34, blue 26 and BJP. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7639.26s)]
*  My attorney, folks, my attorney bringing the ball out. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7647.26s)]
*  Oh, no, with another two points. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7652.26s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7655.26s)]

*  I tell you what, she's an early she's an early thought for MVP today. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7657.26s)]
*  And an emerging candidate for sure. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7663.26s)]
*  Bryce dribbling between his legs just to kind of intimidate them saying you can't do this. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7666.26s)]
*  Nick swiping at nothing, hoping to make something happen for himself. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7672.26s)]
*  It's a brilliant summation of his love life. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7677.26s)]
*  And we're getting free throws there, it seems. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7683.26s)]
*  Yeah, that would be a foul on the shot. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7686.26s)]
*  Bryce lining up a reminder. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7688.26s)]
*  Bryce actually plays pick up basketball on a weekly basis. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7690.26s)]
*  So he's poised to do well here. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7694.26s)]
*  Oh, but remember, he's just warming up that room. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7697.26s)]
*  Bryce wiping the sweat off his hands here as he tries to find it again. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7706.26s)]
*  And he does there, notching another point there for his team, taking the lead to single digits. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7709.26s)]
*  BJP passing to Hassan Hassan looking to take a three. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7715.26s)]
*  Does he make it? [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7720.26s)]
*  Oh, he does not. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7721.26s)]
*  To his old ways, finding the rim. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7723.26s)]
*  This is what we talked about. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7725.26s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7729.26s)]

*  Bryce trying to get the ball. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7738.26s)]
*  The cleanup crude with no luck. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7741.26s)]

*  Bryce playing like he's seven feet tall. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7747.26s)]
*  Man, oh man, does that bode poorly for the big man. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7751.26s)]
*  NMP Law playing like Kobe Bryant post a killing scare. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7756.26s)]
*  Oh, boy. See, what did I tell you? [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7759.26s)]
*  They had to get Hassan Piker out of his game, get him back to the rim. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7762.26s)]
*  Tectone shooting, showing his oh, boy. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7768.26s)]
*  Tectone kind of what I would call that more of a launch than a shot. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7772.26s)]
*  Hassan tries to dunk it. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7777.26s)]
*  Now look, Bryce with the trail. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7780.26s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7783.26s)]
*  What a chase down block from Bryce there. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7785.26s)]
*  Maybe the first chase down block achieved on a slow jog. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7788.26s)]
*  And Red notching another couple of points there, it seems. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7797.26s)]
*  Cypher got to see if he can even the odds there for his team as the lead is still nine points there for Red. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7802.26s)]
*  Erop 2-2-1 chucking a three. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7814.26s)]
*  Man, oh man. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7821.26s)]
*  Hassan. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7824.26s)]
*  There we go, Hassan. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7827.26s)]
*  Going ahead with a nice and sturdy drive there with an easy lay-in using his stature to create something for himself. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7828.26s)]
*  Rob checked in for Red team here. They're going with a twin towers approach there at Hassan's request. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7841.26s)]
*  As Cypher's doing, he's not playing like a team that's down eight. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7846.26s)]
*  Dean's so cool. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7850.26s)]
*  Dean is so far off. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7852.26s)]
*  And from three again, can he do it? No! [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7856.26s)]
*  Hassan. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7862.26s)]
*  Oh, for 148 from three. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7864.26s)]
*  They're going to need to start shooting threes if they want to catch up. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7871.26s)]
*  Red ball, Red ball. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7874.26s)]
*  And it doesn't look like they're going to be able to. You can see the life leaving them. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7876.26s)]
*  The back and forth of basketball really taking a toll. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7880.26s)]
*  Most of these points now are just coming off the backs of defensive surrender. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7883.26s)]
*  Nora. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7887.26s)]
*  Nora. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7888.26s)]
*  Wow. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7889.26s)]
*  You know, every time she makes her shot, she's got the highest percentage of shot to net ratio. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7890.26s)]
*  Nora, but shooting probably upwards of 80, 85% at this point. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7897.26s)]
*  TechTone just kind of chucking and seeing what hits. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7902.26s)]
*  Kind of like his takes. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7907.26s)]
*  Delam, we got some chatter there on the floor. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7914.26s)]
*  It seems like they're strategizing amongst one another. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7916.26s)]
*  I think I heard TechTone. Please keep shooting. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7918.26s)]
*  Nick. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7922.26s)]
*  Oh, right off the rim. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7924.26s)]
*  Honestly, maybe the closest shot he's taken all game from the logo. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7926.26s)]
*  Bryce just kind of passing the two handed chest pass to the basket there. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7933.26s)]
*  He should go back to the three point line. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7937.26s)]
*  Bryce cleated up on the low block there, finding Seifer. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7940.26s)]
*  Seifer knowing he needs to take a three, but not doing it again. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7943.26s)]
*  Putting everyone on a spin cycle there with that bizarre travel. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7948.26s)]
*  We can't call it though. They are really down. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7954.26s)]
*  TechTone! [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7956.26s)]
*  So close yet so, so far. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7958.26s)]
*  The lead has continued to grow. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7962.26s)]
*  Nick, notching his first two points of the day. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7964.26s)]
*  Put that in the highlight reel. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7967.26s)]
*  The brick Pallum fan cam now has a climax. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7970.26s)]
*  Red team is really running away with this game right now, Wake. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7973.26s)]
*  And I just don't see how Blue's going to overcome it. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7977.26s)]
*  I mean, they look fatigued. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7980.26s)]
*  I mean, they're not even on defense. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7982.26s)]
*  It's infectious there. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7984.26s)]
*  Bryce sending it back against Nora. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7986.26s)]
*  Not in his house. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7989.26s)]
*  And no foul. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7991.26s)]
*  Russell is complaining about there not being a foul call, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7992.26s)]
*  which means he certainly won't call it. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7995.26s)]
*  He's alleging that the refs are paid off, Wake. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=7998.26s)]
*  Do you hear that? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8002.26s)]
*  Well, I'm going to be honest. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8003.26s)]
*  They might be. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8005.26s)]
*  In fact, I'm pretty sure that they were indeed paid by the organizer, [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8006.26s)]
*  who is also playing. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8010.26s)]
*  There are a medley of conflicts of interest here. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8012.26s)]
*  That is true. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8015.26s)]
*  TechTone is drawing back on the game. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8016.26s)]
*  That is true. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8019.26s)]
*  TechTone is drawing up another conspiracy theory. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8020.26s)]
*  I think his next tweet may be about how this was rigged. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8024.26s)]
*  I look forward to hearing about how there's a magnet propelling the ball [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8028.26s)]
*  away from the basket. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8032.26s)]
*  He's rubbing his knee there. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8039.26s)]
*  TechTone has a famously and ambiguously injured knee. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8040.26s)]
*  It has been a thorn in his side for some time now. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8044.26s)]
*  They're breathing and assuming kind of planning, but not really. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8051.26s)]
*  See, when I look at them, I see a lot of people who really aren't sweating at all. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8055.26s)]
*  And one argues that that could be their folly there. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8060.26s)]
*  Canute, however, is sweating in an idle animation. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8064.26s)]
*  So we know that there's at least, if nothing else, [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8068.26s)]
*  a good amount of calories being burned. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8071.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8076.26s)]
*  Sweat dripping. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8077.26s)]
*  Let's see. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8080.26s)]
*  We have extra Emily there trying to provide a boost to morale here. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8081.26s)]
*  We are halfway through the fourth quarter, [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8085.26s)]
*  and the lead has only continued to snowball. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8087.26s)]
*  She's just so fucking happy, Wake. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8090.26s)]
*  I mean, how does she do it? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8093.26s)]
*  Well, you know, looking at it from afar. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8095.26s)]
*  Many. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8099.26s)]
*  A cocktail of drugs, it's actually, if anything, kind of a dismal tale. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8100.26s)]
*  Mm. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8105.26s)]
*  We don't want to go into it, I'm sure. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8106.26s)]
*  Extra Emily offered five Spanx for just a small crumble of methamphetamine. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8109.26s)]
*  Really? [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8116.26s)]
*  He said, please, any amount of crystal. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8117.26s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8120.26s)]
*  Should I not ask for that? [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8121.26s)]
*  Was that too loud? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8123.26s)]
*  You know, no wonder she's so happy. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8124.26s)]
*  Well, happy until she's not. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8129.26s)]
*  Mm. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8131.26s)]
*  Until she needs another hit. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8132.26s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8134.26s)]
*  Emily is a bright beacon of light, [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8135.26s)]
*  and observing her makes me question whether or not everything's OK with me. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8137.26s)]
*  Going through a lot. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8144.26s)]
*  My wife, she doesn't talk to me anymore. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8145.26s)]
*  Launched a business, and she's been talking to me. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8148.26s)]
*  She doesn't talk to me anymore. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8151.26s)]
*  Launched a business, Austin. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8153.26s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8155.26s)]
*  Called realyeezys.com.nz.gov. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8156.26s)]
*  That's phenomenal, Wake. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8162.26s)]
*  I'm so sorry about your wife. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8163.26s)]
*  Oh, and more upset about all the Azerbaijani kids. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8166.26s)]
*  They organized a worker strike. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8169.26s)]
*  Oh. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8171.26s)]
*  So, yeah, production slowly going halt. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8172.26s)]
*  All the way down. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8174.26s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8175.26s)]
*  It's all right, though. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8177.26s)]
*  I'm going to get a good YouTube video out of it. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8178.26s)]
*  That's good. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8181.26s)]
*  Silver lining. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8182.26s)]
*  Hassan Piker and Russell. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8184.26s)]
*  Nick Pallin with the ball. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8188.26s)]
*  Nick Pallin. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8190.26s)]
*  Dribbling. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8191.26s)]
*  He's doing that, handing the ball to Emily. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8192.26s)]
*  Who completely collapses under the pressure. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8195.26s)]
*  And E-Rob really just ripping it out of her hands. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8198.26s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8202.26s)]
*  Look at E-Rob finding the one shred of joy left on the court [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8203.26s)]
*  and smothering it. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8207.26s)]
*  If I can't be happy, no one can. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8213.26s)]
*  Let's see Seifer taking his time, as always. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8220.26s)]
*  Oh. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8224.26s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8225.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8226.26s)]
*  Seifer PK, fucking slow fuck. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8227.26s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8235.26s)]

*  We've all been thinking it. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8243.26s)]
*  Your team's down by 13. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8244.26s)]
*  Me is almost notching an essential three pointer. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8246.26s)]
*  Bryce really going to have to up the tempo here [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8250.26s)]

*  I don't want to call it a run. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8255.26s)]
*  It's just enough to let his hair kind of go up and down. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8256.26s)]
*  Here's Seifer taking his sweet fucking time. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8259.26s)]
*  Seifer fighting now. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8262.26s)]
*  That was incredible. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8263.26s)]
*  Finally, you don't see that too often. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8264.26s)]
*  All right, here comes Nick Pallum, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8267.26s)]
*  dribbling, dribbling the ball down the court. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8269.26s)]
*  Dribbling, dribbling, dribbling. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8272.26s)]

*  I don't know who he was talking to [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8316.26s)]
*  and taking a shot to redeem himself, in which he doesn't. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8319.26s)]
*  Oh, how pathetic. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8322.26s)]
*  Well, he had to get back those ways. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8323.26s)]
*  You know, I knew something was up with Russell [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8325.26s)]
*  when he started posting on Instagram [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8327.26s)]
*  like he lived in Miami-Dade County. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8329.26s)]
*  At the gym to at the pool. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8334.26s)]

*  But not his loving wife and child. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8373.56s)]
*  From the three point line. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8378.92s)]

*  It's like he's suspended in Jello. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8402.06s)]
*  A great no look pass to NMP Lowell looking for a give and go. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8406.26s)]
*  But Emily with a shot. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8409.18s)]

*  Two minutes left to play and the result is all but decided. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8523.16s)]
*  Blue team. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8526.84s)]
*  Looking like, well, the blue team about a week ago right now in disbelief. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8529.32s)]
*  That may have been the first. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8535.24s)]
*  Foul shot that we've seen made. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8539.68s)]
*  Oh, no, oh, no, I think Erobe's. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8542.2s)]
*  I know Cypher's made one. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8545.52s)]
*  I mean, look, at the end of the day, it's such a fucking blur, [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8546.84s)]
*  just a collage of misses. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8551.2s)]
*  Flamer misses. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8552.84s)]
*  And Hassan. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8554.92s)]
*  Finally warming up when it counts. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8557.52s)]
*  That's right. When his team's ahead by 40 points, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8559.52s)]
*  Hassan Piker comes through with the three. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8563.0s)]
*  Hassan in the clutch and garbage minutes like he's Brawny James. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8566.08s)]
*  That's right. When the pressure is off, Hassan Piker will deliver. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8569.36s)]
*  Here we go. Hassan Piker looking for another three pointer. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8576.8s)]
*  Will he get it? Yes, he will. Oh, he won't. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8579.84s)]
*  Back to foreplay. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8583.92s)]
*  He's got to figure some stuff out. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8585.0s)]
*  Erobe 2-2-1 with the rebound there. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8587.32s)]
*  Despite having so many open players there [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8591.12s)]
*  and a quick little lay in there, Miz not letting them inbound the ball there. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8594.32s)]
*  They're going to stop play, get the ball down to baseline. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8598.84s)]
*  But I'm going to be honest. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8601.28s)]
*  Oh, they got a minute. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8604.28s)]
*  You know how to put this. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8605.28s)]
*  I don't think there's much of a chance. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8607.6s)]
*  I just, you know, it would be an epic comeback wake, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8608.960000000001s)]
*  but I have to say I don't see there much of a chance either. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8612.48s)]
*  And it looks like blue team feels that way. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8616.199999999999s)]
*  You can see they're absolutely demoralized. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8617.76s)]
*  Julia getting the ball seemingly for the first time in the whole game. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8620.199999999999s)]
*  Well, here's the real thing. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8625.16s)]
*  The true winners of today are Erobe's offline shot. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8626.72s)]
*  That's right. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8629.6s)]
*  Here comes Cypher Piker taking his time as if his team is. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8631.52s)]
*  Oh, what a pass to Erobe. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8635.92s)]
*  Oh, with a game shot there. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8637.6s)]
*  And Julia going with the, I think, what's [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8641.72s)]
*  demonstrable assault of some kind there. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8646.72s)]
*  Nick, can I go ahead and just kind of dribble into scoring position? [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8655.4s)]
*  Ideally, they bleed the clock out, but, you know, leave it to streamers [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8660.32s)]
*  to just keep trying to make it about them. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8663.64s)]
*  Mizgif with an unnecessary shot. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8665.359999999999s)]

*  at 52 points to 39. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8713.880000000001s)]

*  than it looks on camera because, you know, everyone is kind of [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8755.28s)]
*  at a similar degree of atrocious. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8759.76s)]

*  But that's right. I can say this. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8860.359999999999s)]
*  I think everyone at home took a lot of a lot of inspiration [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8862.24s)]
*  away from your story of impersonating a doctor. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkmC2Xjrkg&t=8866.88s)]
