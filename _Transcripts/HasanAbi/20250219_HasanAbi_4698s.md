# Trump Continues His Boring Lies At The FII PRIORITY Summit | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk)
*  dollars for strengthening independent voices in Cambodia. One trillion dollars is larger [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=0.0s)]
*  for improving public. One trillion dollars is larger than the yearly budget for the department [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=5.84s)]
*  of defense. Like everything. Okay. DoD is like eight 50 million. Okay. One trillion [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  dollars would mean that we we've cut spending in the United States of America, an equal [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=21.56s)]
*  larger amount for government and government spending initiatives. President Trump participates [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=29.52s)]
*  in the F what is this? The FII Institute Future Investment Initiative Institution Priority [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=40.44s)]
*  Holy moly. Let's see what this dingus has to say now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  I think politicians spend so much time arguing amongst themselves about the problem. Economics [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=50.7s)]
*  is really simple. I've got 10 pounds in my pocket. If I go out and buy free. Yeah, I'm [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  just like a government. Yeah. But also the government runs like a family. Yeah. But also [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=73.89999999999999s)]
*  businesses. How do businesses operate without turning profit? Yeah. A government is like [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=80.5s)]
*  a family. Yeah. Not a business. It's even not like a business either. But even from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=88.3s)]
*  that perspective, you should understand that you can make investments upon yourself and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=95.46s)]
*  a deficit, especially when you're the United States of America. Yeah. A deficit. Excuse [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=102.38s)]
*  me. I got 10 quid in my pocket. Simple as what's credit then. I've never heard of it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  Usery is a scene. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=122.34s)]
*  An idiot. I just the dumbest argument of all time. Okay. Dumbest argument of all time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=124.14s)]
*  Well, here's why deficits are bad. Okay. I'm a family. I have a family and I make 10 pounds [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=130.34s)]
*  a day. I shouldn't be spending 11 pounds of day, 11 pounds a day, because then I run the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=139.66000000000003s)]
*  risk of getting into too much debt. Are you the government anyway? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=146.58s)]
*  Pints of beer in Cambridge. I'm probably borrowing money. If I carry on doing that, then I'm [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=150.86s)]
*  going to run out of money and I'm going to go bust. It's not difficult, guys. Just sit [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=156.46s)]
*  down, work out what the- [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=161.02s)]
*  I love that he is literally directing this at a fucking economist. This question, who [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=162.62s)]
*  was the finance minister of Greece? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=169.74s)]
*  Country needs to do and work collectively together. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=172.54s)]
*  Because the country does not operate as your budget does. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=174.78s)]
*  But why not? Why not? Why not? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  Why not? I don't know. Even a company doesn't operate in the same way that your budget does, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=181.78s)]
*  dumbass. Because there's a limit to how much you can, there's a limit to how much debt [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=187.34s)]
*  you could incur as an individual citizen. You also don't have the same assets as a company [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  does, for example. This is before we even talk about a government. Okay. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=198.02s)]
*  Country, total expenditure equals total income. In your life, you have a wonderful independence [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=202.02s)]
*  between your expenses and your income. So when you cut down on your expenses, your income [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=210.1s)]
*  doesn't cut. But for the country as a whole, if the country as a whole goes into a major [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  savings spree, then its total income is going to come down. So your personal life is not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=222.74s)]
*  a good model on which to base- [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=228.5s)]
*  There you go. Well, he did it better than I did because he has a cooler accent. But [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=233.06s)]
*  it would have been better if he said, the government doesn't operate like your budget. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=237.9s)]
*  You absolute donkey. Damn. Everyone's clapping. You got absolutely destroyed. Get rekt, Bozo. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=245.18s)]
*  It's awesome. It's the classic. It's the classic dumb guy trope to be like, well, my family [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  budget works this way. Okay. That's not even how businesses work, dumbass. And even businesses [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=259.22s)]
*  are not the same as the government. Very popular. Wow. That's very nice. Sitting next to Elon. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=265.74s)]
*  Wow. That's you couldn't do better than that, huh? As well as my own special envoy to the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=276.74s)]
*  Middle East, who's really done a fantastic job. Can you explain the difference? Okay. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  Very quickly, I'm going to explain the difference, even though Yana's quite literally did. If [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=290.86s)]
*  the government goes in a spending spree, then people make less money. The government becomes [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=295.14s)]
*  less wealthy overall. Okay. But in terms of corporations, which is something that you can [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  understand as well, corporations run a deficit all the time. They take on more and more debt. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=305.3s)]
*  Why? Because they reinvested into developing in the past into developing, you know, new technologies [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=310.34s)]
*  and stuff. Now they don't really do that. But back in the day, they used to do that. You have to hear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=317.78s)]
*  the simple in the simplest terms, you got to spend money to make money. Okay. That's it. Saving spay. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=323.62s)]
*  I misspoke. I f**ked it up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  We did a little show last night. I heard they got very good ratings too, by the way we did [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=343.06s)]
*  Hannity. Sean Hannity is fantastic. A fantastic man, a fantastic guy. And he did a show and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=347.38s)]
*  it was great being on the show with you last night. I come today with a simple message for [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=353.94s)]
*  business leaders from all across the nation and all around the world. If you want to build the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=359.38s)]
*  future, push boundaries, unleash breakthroughs, transform industries, or make a fortune, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  because you want to make a fortune. Most of you have already made a fortune. I don't want to say [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=370.42s)]
*  that. There's no better place on earth than the current and future United States of America under [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=374.5s)]
*  a certain president named Donald J. Trump. I think that also another part of the government [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=382.1s)]
*  household analogy that is so idiotic is that when the government actually engages in a savings spree, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=386.5s)]
*  right? Not a spending spree, but a savings spree. Who do you think suffers the most? Do you think [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=393.22s)]
*  it's the wealthy? If they were to suffer the most, why are they constantly agitating to do that? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=398.34000000000003s)]
*  It is actually the poor that suffer the most because a lot of those expenditures go directly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=403.22s)]
*  to cost-cutting subsidies. Okay? If you like, or in the past if you enjoyed egg prices, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=408.98s)]
*  maintaining relative stability, understand that there is a big chunk of government spending [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=417.22s)]
*  that makes it the case. Okay? That makes it so that egg prices remain stable and relatively low. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=422.58000000000004s)]
*  What do you think happens when the government stops spending money? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=429.22s)]
*  Happening. Since my election, America's economic engines have come roaring back to life in just [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=433.14s)]
*  a very short period of time. Think of it from November 5th. The progress that's been made has [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=441.3s)]
*  been amazing. The Nasdaq is up nearly 10% in just a few months, and that's a lot. The Dow [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=446.74s)]
*  Jones Industrial Average is up 2,200 points, and Bitcoin has set multiple all-time record highs [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=456.26s)]
*  because everyone knows that I'm committed to making America the crypto capital. We want to stay [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  at the forefront of everything, and one of them is crypto. And Miami seems to be the center of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=469.62s)]
*  the action. Come to think of it, and maybe it'll stay there. Business optimism skyrocketed. 42 [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=476.5s)]
*  points. Think of that in a single month, the most in history by far. That's the biggest increase in [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=483.38s)]
*  history by not even close. The ISM index of manufacturing activity surged into positive [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=488.82s)]
*  territory for the first time in many years. Amazing. And it was just announced — this is [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=496.74s)]
*  an interesting one. I didn't realize it was that bad for so long — but it was just announced by [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=502.98s)]
*  one of the nation's most historically accurate and respected pollsters, Rasmussen, that the number [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=507.3s)]
*  of Americans who believe our country is on the right track now exceeds those who think it's heading [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=513.7s)]
*  in the wrong direction for the first time in 20 years. Can you believe that? 20 years. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=519.38s)]
*  And this is really a seismic 27-point swing from just before the election. That's — nobody's [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=527.62s)]
*  ever seen anything like that one. Yes, sir, I want to tell you. That's a big one. The best and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=533.94s)]
*  most successful business leaders on Earth are now racing to invest in the United States since November. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  DMACC has announced plans to invest $40 billion in the U.S., creating at least 10,000 jobs. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=545.62s)]
*  SoftBank has announced investments of between $100 billion and $200 billion, creating at least [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=551.86s)]
*  100,000 American jobs. Oracle and OpenAI and SoftBank are now collectively committing $500 [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=558.98s)]
*  billion to keep the United States on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence. And so many more. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=565.78s)]
*  I mean, so many companies that want to come to the White House and have a little news conference [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=571.78s)]
*  all the time. I said, why don't you just announce it? But they want to come, and I'll do that. I [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=577.22s)]
*  don't mind doing that. I say anytime they want to go $10 billion or more, I'm there. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=582.1s)]
*  $10 billion or more. But on his recent visit to the White House, the Prime Minister of Japan [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=588.66s)]
*  announced he anticipates Japanese investment to the United States of well over a trillion dollars. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=595.62s)]
*  And we're working on an Alaska pipeline already, which is the closest point to Asia. And as you [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=601.14s)]
*  know, the ANWR, which we've started — Ronald Reagan couldn't get it approved. Nobody could get [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=607.54s)]
*  it approved for so many years. Couldn't get it approved. I got it approved. I actually got it [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=613.46s)]
*  approved twice. I got it approved and Biden ended it. That was a shocker. But we just got it approved [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=617.22s)]
*  again. We're going to be — it's probably the largest deposit maybe anywhere in the world, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=622.34s)]
*  just by itself. It's, they say, of similar size to Saudi Arabia, so we hope that's correct. But [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=629.94s)]
*  all of this is only happening because of the world changing results of the 2024 election. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=635.7s)]
*  We won the House. We won the Senate, the White House, and the Electoral College, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=643.0600000000001s)]
*  and the popular vote in a landslide. We also won all seven swing states, and all 50 states [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=647.86s)]
*  shifted in the Republican direction for the first time ever. So every state, every single state of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=655.46s)]
*  the 50 states shifted Republican. That's never happened before. Either way, it's never happened. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=660.98s)]
*  And 85 percent of counties voted for Trump. Think of that. So you have 2,600 counties versus 525. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=668.1s)]
*  2,600. Think of that. That's why when you look at the election map after it was all done, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=678.74s)]
*  the certified map, the whole thing was red. 2,600 versus 500. It's a big, big — nobody's seen [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=684.34s)]
*  anything like it, actually. So as a result of this very historic victory, investors from all [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=695.14s)]
*  over the planet once again have confidence in America's future and respect for America's leaders, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=700.18s)]
*  and it's about time we get a little respect. The last administration was the worst and most [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=706.5s)]
*  incompetent in the history of our country, but we are moving quickly to fix every single disaster [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=712.98s)]
*  Joe Biden created and make America stronger and more prosperous than ever before. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=717.94s)]
*  Our first and most urgent mission is to remove the criminals that Biden allowed into our country [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=729.62s)]
*  with the ridiculous and very dangerous open borders policy. They came from all over the world. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=735.7s)]
*  They came from prisons and jails. They came from mental institutions and insane asylums. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=742.58s)]
*  They were gang members. They were drug lords. They came from all over, and they were allowed [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=750.1s)]
*  to come into our country, and we're getting them out in record levels, just like they came in in [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=755.7800000000001s)]

*  Oh my God, it's so fucking boring. He never shuts the fuck up about the same shit. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=768.5s)]
*  Never anything new here. Holy moly. I guess it's my idiotic expectation that he's going to talk [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=776.74s)]
*  about something different, but — [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=783.46s)]
*  He's taking them back. They're sending their criminals to us, and they're all taking them back. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=785.22s)]
*  We had a little problem with a couple of them that ended very quickly. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=789.06s)]
*  And some said, we don't really want MS-13 back in our country, but I said, congratulations, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=792.82s)]
*  you're taking them back, and they take them back. And by the way, Europe and other places ought to [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=798.02s)]
*  start also doing that. They better start looking at immigration because it's really hurting Europe [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=803.62s)]
*  very, very badly, and they better get smart and they better get tough before it's too late. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=808.74s)]
*  We're also working to end the highest inflation in our country's history, all caused because they [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=813.3000000000001s)]
*  played with our energy policy and wasted money on the Green New Scam and other things such as that. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=818.1s)]
*  And they wasted monies at never seen before levels. If Joe Biden had simply held federal [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=824.74s)]

*  on you without naming you directly. Says, Osan's view count bot? I doubt it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=841.62s)]
*  Tariff income, which is really — it's already turned out to be amazing, actually. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=845.3s)]
*  It's really meant more for bringing countries and companies into our country. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=852.42s)]
*  It's the best language. It's the best word in the world. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=857.62s)]
*  The numbers are — [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=859.78s)]
*  In the English language. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=860.5799999999999s)]
*  — staggering because we're the big piggy bank that everybody wants to be. And they can play games [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=861.8599999999999s)]
*  and they can say, well, there'll be retribution and equal this and that, but they can't be equal. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=866.9s)]
*  But we want to keep it so that we're the big piggy bank. And if we had years like we did the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=872.5s)]
*  last four years, that wouldn't have lasted too long. We're not promising it. But, you know, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=876.8199999999999s)]
*  all of these things could happen. We hope to balance our budget. So I don't want to promise [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=884.18s)]
*  it because if I do and we come about $10 short, the fake news media back there would say, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=888.74s)]
*  we have breaking news. He did not make it. He did not make it. But we'll get it done very soon. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=895.3000000000001s)]
*  It might not be this year, but it could be this year. Actually, we have a chance of getting it [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=901.7s)]
*  even this year, which people would be shocked at because they were talking about 10 years, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=905.3000000000001s)]
*  15 years, 20 years from now. When I took office last month, we inherited the consequences of [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=909.0600000000001s)]
*  inflation. That was more than four times what it was when I left four years ago. Think of that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=915.38s)]
*  I left it was at 1.4 percent and the annual government spending over 1.5 trillion dollars [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=921.86s)]
*  more than projected in 2020 alone. 1.5 trillion. But under the Trump administration, all of that [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=929.78s)]
*  is changing faster and more dramatically than anyone ever thought possible. They didn't think [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=936.58s)]
*  it was possible to do what we've done in just a very short period of time. We've accomplished [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=941.22s)]
*  more in four weeks than most administrations accomplish in four years. On my first day in [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=946.42s)]
*  office, I imposed an immediate federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze and a foreign [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=952.0999999999999s)]
*  aid freeze. I signed an order creating the Department of Government Deficiency and [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=957.78s)]
*  put a man named Elon Musk in charge. Thank you, Elon, for doing it. Thank you very much. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=963.78s)]
*  And he's doing a great job. I wish you could have seen him last night. It's really, you know, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=970.34s)]
*  he's a very committed person. He's a very serious person and he's a very high IQ people. You know, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=977.14s)]
*  I like high IQ people. Not all have to be, but you know, it'd be nice to have some people up there [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=983.0600000000001s)]
*  that he's a seriously high IQ individual. Now he's got his faults also, I will tell you that. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=987.86s)]
*  But not too many of them, which is now really waging war on government waste, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=995.7800000000001s)]
*  fraud and abuse. And they're curbing inflation and saving taxpayers billions and billions of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=999.86s)]
*  dollars every single day. And there's even under consideration a new concept where we give 20% [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1005.46s)]
*  of the Doge savings to American citizens and 20% goes to paying down debt because the numbers are [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1012.26s)]
*  incredible, Elon. So many billions of dollars, billions, hundreds of billions. And we're thinking [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1018.66s)]
*  about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% down to pay back debt and pay down debt, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1025.06s)]
*  which is if you look at value, if it were a real estate balance sheet, the debt is tiny, but we [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1031.62s)]
*  still want to pay it down. It doesn't matter. We don't look at it as a piece of real estate. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1038.74s)]
*  It's America. We're going to get it down through intelligence, hard work. And as Elon said, a word [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1043.22s)]
*  called caring. You have to have you have to care by doing this. Americans will tell us [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1049.06s)]
*  where there is waste. They'll be reporting it themselves. They participate in the process [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1054.8999999999999s)]
*  of saving money. So many of the men and women in this room, as an example, they pay tremendous [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1060.4199999999998s)]
*  amounts of taxes. And here are just a few examples of where your money was going before I came along. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1065.86s)]
*  These are just some of the just taken at random. Oh, there are much worse examples than this. I was [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1072.98s)]
*  just looking at them before the speech and I can tell you they were much worse. And there are some [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1078.66s)]
*  that are horrible, but I don't want to really say them because they're very, very embarrassing. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1083.46s)]
*  Do you reckon he survives his term? Evil never dies. Evil never dies. Dick Cheney is still alive. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1091.0600000000002s)]
*  Evil never dies. Trump is talking about this will never happen. Of course, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1096.5800000000002s)]
*  president Trump and Elon Musk proposed 5,000 Doge dividend checks to all Americans with a possible [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1100.66s)]
*  one trillion in savings. When it ministry, Oh my God, this is literally like a, like a TikTok meme. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1104.9s)]
*  We're operating. We're operating on TikTok memes. President Donald Trump is going to give every [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1110.98s)]
*  American $5,000 after they cut one trillion in spending is you, if you believe this, if you [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1117.14s)]
*  believe that this is going to happen, you have to be the dumbest person on the fucking planet. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1125.94s)]
*  Okay. Like straight up, especially like every part of this is ridiculous. The part where they're [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1130.9s)]
*  going to cut $1 trillion in spending ridiculous. Okay. What will happen in that process will make [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1138.02s)]
*  the $5,000 Doge dividend that you get look like $3. Okay. That's the other side of this. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1148.66s)]
*  The other side of this equation that makes this such a fucking insanely stupid thing is that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1156.5s)]
*  cutting $1 trillion would probably make prices explode. We'd look like Argentina. Okay. And if [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1163.54s)]
*  you think that let's say they did the unthinkable, they did the unimaginable, they successfully [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1172.42s)]
*  chopped $1 trillion from the government budgets. If you think you are going to see a penny in [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1177.38s)]
*  of that money, you are also the dumbest person on the planet. Read the second reply from Grok. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1186.4199999999998s)]
*  I would rather kill myself than watch. Listen to a grok summary of Doge cuts. Okay. What does that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1193.6999999999998s)]
*  mean? $1 trillion for strengthening independent voices in Cambodia. $1 trillion is larger than [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1203.3799999999999s)]
*  the yearly budget for the department of defense. Like everything. Okay. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1214.9s)]
*  DoD is like 850 million. Okay. $1 trillion would mean that we've cut spending in the United States [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1221.94s)]
*  of America, an equal, larger amount, 850 billion. Sorry. That's did I say million? 850 billion. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1232.1000000000001s)]

*  $1 trillion in us spending is more than the fucking DOD is yearly, yearly costs. Okay. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1246.58s)]
*  $29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh, $20 million for fiscal federalism [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1255.06s)]
*  and $19 million in addition to the $21 million for biodiversity conversion in Nepal. $1.5 million. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1263.46s)]
*  Everyone got $5,000. That's more than $1 trillion. If not $1.5 trillion. Yeah, it's so stupid. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1273.38s)]
*  $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $2.5 million for inclusive democracies in South Africa, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1280.3400000000001s)]

*  Hamas. You know about that? $100 million for condoms. Condoms. Does everybody know what a condom is? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1303.22s)]
*  For Hamas. Wait, why is he still? They admitted that this was wrong. Why are they still saying this? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1311.38s)]
*  I could read this list all day long. I just don't want to bore you. But these are just some and not [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1317.46s)]

*  They just keep doubling. They keep giving more condoms to Hamas. They're also finding tremendous [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1327.22s)]
*  abuse, waste and fraud and social security. Social security is what's happening. They've [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1331.46s)]
*  doubled the number of condoms going to Hamas. How is this possible? After they openly admitted [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1335.8600000000001s)]
*  that it was a lie. Elon Musk literally said, sometimes we get things wrong. It's not a big [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1342.26s)]
*  deal. And he's still like, no, they're giving $1 trillion of condoms to Hamas. Think of that. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1347.22s)]
*  Now, over 100, there aren't a lot of people that make it. Hopefully most of the people in this room [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1354.26s)]
*  will make it. But historically, you don't have thousands and thousands of people. But listen to [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1359.06s)]
*  this. 3.6 million people are on social security rolls from the age of 110 years old to 119. Do [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1365.3s)]

*  which is approximately 110 years older than our country. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1485.1399999999999s)]

*  Okay. And then of course he survived the process long enough so that he could fucking turn it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1550.1799999999998s)]

*  take about four years to defeat ISIS. And he did it in three weeks. I said to him, what do you think, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1690.34s)]
*  General? How long will it take, sir? I think we should do it in less than four weeks. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1696.74s)]
*  You're going to have time left over. And he did, he did that. And we were told by the television [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1702.1s)]
*  generals who would take four years. So we did it. That's when I went to Iraq. I flew to Iraq [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1706.74s)]
*  and late at night, the dark of night, all the windows, all the lights off in the plane. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1712.42s)]

*  but we may have to go a different route because it's taken them a long time. We're going to get [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1770.02s)]
*  military that's going to start building. We're going to get people to start building properly [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1773.46s)]

*  anyone believes anything he says at this point ever. Yes. A July, 2024 report from social [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1795.6200000000001s)]
*  securities inspector general states that from 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out most [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1800.74s)]
*  8.6 trillion in benefits, including 71.8 billion or less than 1% in improper payments. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1806.02s)]
*  Most of the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1810.98s)]
*  captain. Captain, we don't see any lights. Is it, is everything? Yes, sir. Everything's fine, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1840.98s)]
*  sir. We'll be landing in three minutes. And then it goes like 600, 500. Captain, we okay. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1849.46s)]
*  And then he goes 400, 300, 200. And I'm saying, man, there's nothing out there. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1862.1s)]
*  And then he goes, boom, perfect landing right on this thing. There are no lights on the runway. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1871.06s)]
*  You want to know the irony? I think like gutting the IRS or gutting federal agencies is [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1877.78s)]
*  unironically going to cause more faulty payments and probably cause social security to go out to [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1884.02s)]
*  people who have died more frequently because you fired employees that are most likely auditing that [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1891.94s)]
*  process. So that's the other side of this bargain, which is that, you know, a big part of [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1899.14s)]
*  government spending also goes to ensuring that there isn't additional payments being made. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1906.26s)]
*  For example, there is all of this accounting that is necessary, but of course it doesn't matter [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1912.42s)]
*  because clearly they don't care if there's a lot of faulty payments happening because they want to [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1919.8600000000001s)]
*  completely gut it anyway. They want to destroy it. Numbers that Elon Musk presented weren't [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1925.3s)]
*  faulty payments anyway. It was actually just, it was a faulty interpretation of the data that exists. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1929.62s)]
*  Social security, they said they reclaimed over 200 million incorrect payments in the last few years. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1936.74s)]
*  It's an incredibly low error rate under 1% because getting social security takes a massively high bar [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1941.1399999999999s)]
*  and faking someone staying alive past their death for more than a month or two is really, really hard. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1946.34s)]
*  And most people think it's easy because stupid. Yeah. Can we just debunk his claims to move on [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1950.18s)]
*  his voice? Voices infuriating. Well, I can't even debunk his claims in real time considering that he [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1954.34s)]
*  brought forth that faulty social security notion probably 35 minutes ago. And in that process, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1960.1799999999998s)]
*  he just kept lying and droning on and on about how he wanted to suck the dicks of the helicopter [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1966.1s)]
*  pilots or whatever, or the plane pilots that landed him in Iraq and the dead of the night [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1971.78s)]
*  with no lights on and also added eight other lies on top of the initial lie. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1976.6599999999999s)]
*  It is virtually impossible to in real time, fact check Donald Trump. It has always been impossible. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1983.6200000000001s)]
*  There will never be there because he just, every sentence, every sentence is established on a [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1990.18s)]
*  faulty premise. And then the additional sentences that accompany the first sentence also expand on [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=1996.58s)]
*  that initial lie with new lies. Like the condoms for Gaza story is fantastic. It's the, it's a [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2003.94s)]
*  great example of this. Okay. Donald Trump's administration, Caroline Leavitt comes out and [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2012.42s)]
*  says, we're giving Hamas $50 million worth of condoms. Turns out it's not condoms and turns out [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2017.0600000000002s)]
*  it's not Hamas. It's Mozambique, a part of the USAID initiative to send contraceptives and, and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2023.54s)]
*  like sanitary medical, sanitary products like, to Mozambique, okay. Gaza in Mozambique, not Gaza, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2030.18s)]
*  the Gaza strip. And it's not $50 million, but it doesn't matter. What did Donald Trump say today? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2038.18s)]
*  Earlier today, Donald Trump doubled the number, said it's not 50 million. Now he's saying it's [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2045.78s)]
*  a hundred million and also exp- and, and still, still is claiming that it's going to Hamas. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2051.2200000000003s)]
*  We are now giving a hundred million dollars of condoms to Hamas. Why do we do that though? Seems [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2057.62s)]
*  like a waste. Good thing you don't work in the responsible agency that, you know, decides what [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2062.5s)]
*  kind of anti-HIV spreading initiatives that we're engaged in, in Africa for social welfare and for [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2068.74s)]
*  the healthcare of the entire fucking planet. Yeah, I know, dude, if you're the guy making these [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2075.54s)]
*  decisions, you're going to make a lot of stupid fucking decisions. I think personally with a [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2080.42s)]
*  metric ton of evil shit that the American empire does, I feel like, you know, any sort of anti- any [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2086.5s)]
*  sort of initiative that combats HIV spreading in Africa, in African nations, is a good thing. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2093.7s)]
*  Okay, we are broke though. No, we're not! This is the richest country on the fucking planet, you [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2099.06s)]
*  dumbass! What do you mean we're broke? Shut the fuck up! What are you saying? We're broke. Oh my [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2103.3s)]

*  working hard. You could never build a company or a country with that. So we have a very strong [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2118.4199999999996s)]
*  policy and if they don't show up to work, they get fired. And we're trying to make our government [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2123.8599999999997s)]
*  smaller but much stronger. And we have tremendous bureaucracy, but it's happening. A lot of people [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2130.3399999999997s)]
*  are leaving and in some cases leaving with pretty good offers, you know, you're paid seven or eight [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2135.8599999999997s)]
*  months and go out, find a job. But some of these people had jobs that were actually working for us, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2140.98s)]
*  but they also had other jobs. And those people, in theory, they have problems. I don't know if [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2145.94s)]
*  we're going to do anything about that. So we have other things to do, but they were working other [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2150.34s)]
*  jobs instead of working for us. So they were staying home working, but they were working other [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2155.22s)]
*  jobs, getting paid a lot of money, perhaps. We offer deferred resignation buyout. I shouldn't have [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2159.14s)]
*  yelled at that chatter and called him a dumb ass. He probably thinks we're broke because [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2166.26s)]
*  his infrastructure is crumbling and he doesn't see a single dollar that of that GDP returned back to [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2170.9s)]
*  him in meaningful social benefits. So he probably thinks understandably, like many Americans, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2177.38s)]
*  Oh, we must be really broke. It's probably because of what are these guys in at the top saying the [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2183.6200000000003s)]
*  deficit that must mean that that is probably the reason why we're broke because the potholes ain't [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2189.3s)]
*  getting fixed. My infrastructure is dog shit. Internet sometimes cuts out for no fucking reason. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2195.62s)]
*  So that's the reason why you probably think you're broke. You're not. I mean, you individually are [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2201.7s)]
*  probably broke, but the American government certainly is not broke. Okay. And it's also [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2206.66s)]
*  kind of funny to assume that the American government is broke because of USAID sending condoms to [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2213.14s)]
*  Mozambique, not just condoms, but like contraceptives in general and to combat HIV [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2219.2999999999997s)]

*  Great. In other words, we will rapidly grow our economy by dramatically shrinking the federal [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2232.1s)]
*  government that we have to do it. I'm also taking fast action to end the radical left nation, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2237.06s)]
*  wrecking crusade, a grill gas over the past four years, the Biden administration cut the number of [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2242.8199999999997s)]
*  new oil leases and gas leases by 95%. They slowed new pipeline. I mean, look at the [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2248.82s)]
*  anyone Dakota access. They wanted that one knocked out the keystone pipeline. They wanted that one [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2257.7000000000003s)]
*  knocked out. They ended the keystone. We got the Dakota access done, but it wasn't easy after they [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2263.2200000000003s)]
*  tried to stop it. They slowed new oil and gas pipeline construction to virtually a halt. They [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2269.7000000000003s)]
*  shut down. Thanks for correcting yourself. The deficit is why I think we're broke. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2275.54s)]
*  Okay. You know, I re like, I wasn't correcting myself. I was correcting myself on why you are [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2280.2599999999998s)]
*  wrong. Okay. I was apologizing not because you were right. I was apologizing because you're wrong, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2287.3s)]
*  but you're probably wrong because people lie to you all the time. And that's crazy. That didn't [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2295.46s)]
*  imply. I didn't at any point imply that you were correct. And I was wrong in my initial assessment. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2300.74s)]
*  I was just wrong in how I handled it. Meant for emergencies. It was meant for emergencies. It [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2305.9399999999996s)]
*  wasn't getting a price of gasoline down so that you can win an election. Didn't work for winning [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2312.02s)]
*  the election. Actually, there's so many people that are driving that it's a very small number, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2318.18s)]
*  just had a very small effect. But in the meantime, it takes it down. It's that now it's at the low, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2326.02s)]
*  we'll fill it up fast, but it's at the lowest level. When we made the transition, it was at [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2330.5s)]
*  the lowest level in history ever recorded. It's the lowest level. Nobody's ever seen it that way. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2336.82s)]
*  They, they put it all out because they thought they could keep gasoline prices down a little bit, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2340.9s)]
*  just go past the election. And after that, they didn't care. And it didn't work because they [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2346.5s)]
*  didn't get elected. I got elected, but the price of gasoline still rose over 35%. And in some cases, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2351.62s)]
*  at some periods, it was 100% and 125% during certain periods of time. Under the Trump [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2357.46s)]
*  administration, we have implemented a very different plan. You probably heard of it. It's called [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2363.94s)]
*  drill baby drill. And we're doing it. The world runs on low cost energy and energy producing [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2370.98s)]
*  nations like us have nothing to apologize for. We have more energy than any other nation in the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2379.7s)]
*  world. And we're going to use it. And we're going to use it on AI plants. I was telling some of the [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2385.94s)]
*  people that came in that, you know, they're very interested. Everybody's talking about AI. I hope [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2392.7400000000002s)]
*  you're right. I don't know who knows, but Elan, are they right? Are they right in going all, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2397.62s)]
*  they are all in for AI. But the problem is to do it just in our country, you need twice the electricity [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2403.62s)]
*  just to open up and be the top of AI. You need twice the electricity that we have right now in [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2411.7799999999997s)]
*  the entire country. If you take all of the electricity, you need more than twice. You need [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2416.5s)]
*  twice. You need double what we have right now just to fuel this new industry that's growing. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2421.62s)]
*  I was amazed when I heard that number. And they all said, how can we do this? Because, you know, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2427.22s)]
*  in China and various other places, you can probably get it with the shake of a hand. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2431.8599999999997s)]
*  But in our country, you can't. But now you can because we've declared, I'm declaring a [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2438.26s)]
*  national emergency in order to get fast approvals. And we're going to have, if you build a plant, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2442.5s)]
*  you're able to build an electric generating facility right next to your plant. So you'll be [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2447.7s)]
*  making your own. You won't have to count on utilities. You won't have to count on an old [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2453.46s)]
*  grid that could fail, could get hit by something, bad things or good things. But you're not going to [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2458.18s)]
*  have to. You're not going to have to worry about grids. You're not going to have to build your [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2464.5s)]
*  plant and you'll build your your essentially you'll become a utility in a way. You build your own [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2468.18s)]
*  electricity if you want to build extra and put it out and get paid for that. You're going to be able [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2472.5s)]
*  to do that. You could put it back into the grid, but you're going to be able to build with your [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2478.1s)]
*  plant a generating facility. And we're going to get your Lee Zeldin, head of the environment, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2482.1s)]
*  head of environmental, the environmental group, various groups. We've got them unified now, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2487.38s)]
*  but we're going to get you very fast. He wants, he wants factories to build their own energy grids [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2494.18s)]
*  that is that what he's saying? Like we're going to let you do your own energy. We're going to let, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2500.74s)]
*  if you're a private corporation, you can just like build your own energy grid. Is that what he's [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2507.2999999999997s)]
*  saying entirely on fossil fuels for the AI data centers? Oh, great. Love that wasteful deficit [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2511.62s)]
*  spending. And I withdrew the United States from the unfair one sided Paris climate accord. And I [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2519.22s)]
*  ended Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate because it was just insane. I repealed the last. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2525.06s)]
*  And by the way, you want to buy an electric car? It's great. If you want to buy a gasoline [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2533.2999999999997s)]
*  driven car or a hybrid, it's great. Whatever the whatever the thing happens to be. I heard [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2537.7s)]
*  hydrogens hot. The problem is when it's not urine because when that sucker blows up, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2544.18s)]
*  they don't find the body. So that's one that I said, you know, let's take a pass on that one. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2549.2999999999997s)]
*  They said it's good, but when it's bad, it's really bad. You find the bodies on trees on the side of a [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2554.1s)]
*  tree. I think on that one, right? We're not going to want that one, but you never know. Maybe someday [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2558.3399999999997s)]
*  it'll be good, but it doesn't sound like it's off to a good start. I repealed the last administration's [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2565.2999999999997s)]
*  very destructive natural gas export ban. And last week we approved our first new liquefied natural [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2570.74s)]
*  gas export license. And we have literally hundreds of people that want to export. I recently met with [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2578.4199999999996s)]
*  the Japanese prime minister Shiba to discuss large increases in American oil and gas exports. They [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2585.62s)]
*  want it so badly. They said we went to the Biden. He's going to be dead soon. He don't care about our [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2592.9799999999996s)]
*  fucking planet, bro. Rich people, no matter what age they are, don't care about the planet. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2597.06s)]
*  Okay. They did. It's just like, it doesn't matter. They think that they can with, with their wealth, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2603.94s)]
*  they think they can avoid some of the worst impacts. Very few people, like very few countries have [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2610.9s)]
*  like really actually no country has. I also met with prime minister Modi of India who wants to [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2615.7799999999997s)]
*  greatly expand India's purchase of American energy. And my administration has also launched the most [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2620.66s)]
*  aggressive deregulation program of any nation in history under my executive order for every one new [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2626.66s)]
*  regulation added. 10 old regulations have to be eliminated. And you know, in our first term, which [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2633.2999999999997s)]
*  was actually an incredible success, we had the greatest economy in history until COVID. And even [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2643.62s)]
*  after that, we did great. The stock market was higher. If you think of it, it was higher after [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2649.06s)]
*  the fact after we went through that whole thing, it was higher than it was just prior to COVID [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2653.94s)]
*  coming in, which is a pretty amazing thing. But we did a great job on that. But it was a terrible [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2660.7400000000002s)]
*  thing for the world. The whole world suffered. It suffered terribly, including China, including [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2667.62s)]
*  other countries. It just was a terrible period of time. But despite that, we did well, but we had [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2672.5s)]
*  the greatest economy in the history of our country. And I think this time we're going to do even better. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2678.18s)]
*  We were artificially hurt by COVID. We had to focus on that instead of focusing on. But just prior [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2683.8599999999997s)]
*  to COVID coming in, there's never been anything like what we did, what we achieved. And even after [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2689.7s)]
*  we did very well, and especially considering what all of us had to do with COVID, some nations were [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2694.58s)]
*  hit so badly, it was just unbelievable what happened to them. As part of our effort, I've signed [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2699.9399999999996s)]
*  executive orders to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2706.98s)]
*  Joe Biden's war on Bitcoin and crypto. We ended that war totally. That war is over. They were very [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2712.58s)]
*  hostile toward them until the very end, just because there are so many people on Bitcoin and [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2718.66s)]
*  crypto that just before the end, the SEC came out and they were being very nice. I was so nice to [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2723.7s)]
*  people because so many people were being indicted for no reason whatsoever. Very political group of [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2729.7s)]
*  people. That's all they did was they liked indicting people, but they were being indicted. And [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2735.7s)]
*  many of those indictments were dropped just before the election because they said, wait a minute, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2741.94s)]
*  there's 100 million, 125 million people using this and they didn't want to have, you know, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2747.38s)]
*  all these people being voted against. But by the time they did that, it was too late. We had that [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2754.42s)]
*  vote entirely, I think. I think anybody would smart, a lot of people believing it. Anybody that [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2758.98s)]
*  was smart voted for Trump and they pulled the indictments. And I see people that were indicted. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2764.42s)]
*  I said, I saved your life. I saved your life because if they thought that they actually thought [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2768.82s)]
*  that I was doing this, they said, why is Trump doing it? Is he doing it for political reasons? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2775.46s)]
*  I don't do anything for political reasons. I do what's right. I do. I want to be in the forefront [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2779.3s)]
*  of every industry. So I'll be working with the Republican Congress to pass the largest tax cuts [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2783.86s)]
*  in American history. And that includes, obviously, yeah, that includes we have to extend the Trump [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2792.9s)]
*  tax cuts, which were until now the largest. We're going to dramatically cut taxes for families and [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2799.78s)]
*  for workers and for companies, including no tax on tips and hopefully no tax on Social Security [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2805.94s)]
*  and no tax on overtime. And that overtime one is a sleeper because I think a lot of people are [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2811.46s)]
*  going to be spurred on to do a lot of extra work. When they hear that, it's a lot of companies really [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2816.42s)]
*  like it. A lot of people really like it. The new Trump tax cuts will also include 100 percent [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2821.94s)]
*  expensing for new factory construction in the United States and anything else. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2827.94s)]
*  With capital, if you buy something, if you buy something that is going to be good for our country, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2834.82s)]
*  we're going to let you expense it one year expense. And I did that the first time and [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2840.9s)]
*  everybody was saying, can you go back to that? Now you still get, I guess, 40 percent or whatever. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2846.1s)]
*  But it, you know, pairs down. But we're going to bring that right up to the to the top level. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2850.58s)]
*  I think that had a lot to do with the success that I had during my first term. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2855.46s)]
*  I will substantially cut taxes for all domestic producers. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2859.78s)]
*  In my first term, I brought the business tax down from around 40 percent to 21 percent. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2866.58s)]
*  Which everybody said was an impossible thing to do. I cut it from 40. It actually was state and [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2872.42s)]
*  city was much higher than 40. I got it down 21 percent. And now I'm bringing it down to [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2877.38s)]
*  a goal of 15 percent. But only if you make your product in America. In other words, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2883.62s)]
*  you're going to be a 21 percent. But if you make your product in America, you're going to go from [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2888.34s)]
*  21 to 15. If you don't, you're going to pay 21 percent, which is still lower than anything. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2893.06s)]
*  So why are you cutting taxes for people that are producing overseas? Then if your entire purpose, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2898.42s)]
*  if you want to, if you want to tax companies less and incentivize them positively, then you can do [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2904.5s)]
*  that in the opposite direction. Tax companies more, bring it back to the current, bring it back to the [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=2911.22s)]

*  a separation is just, you know, we're helping Europe. We're trying to help Europe. On top of [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3270.5s)]
*  this, Alinsky admits that half of the money that we sent them is missing. They don't know where the [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3277.22s)]

*  A dictator without elections. So Linsky better move faster. He's not going to have a country [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3317.86s)]
*  left. Got to move. Got to move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction. In the meantime, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3323.06s)]
*  we're successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia. Something all admit that only Trump [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3328.26s)]
*  is going to be able to do in the Trump administration. We're going to be able to do it. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3334.9s)]
*  I think Putin even admitted that Biden never tried Europe has failed to bring peace. And [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3339.06s)]

*  not Biden leadership did not actually take, okay. They didn't do it with Israel. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3362.58s)]
*  They left it up to Donald Trump. They didn't do it with Russia and they left it up to Donald Trump. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3368.34s)]
*  So just remember that anytime people talk about like where we're at in terms of American foreign [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3375.78s)]
*  policy. I love Ukraine, but Zelensky has done a terrible job. His country is shattered and [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3380.6600000000003s)]
*  millions and millions of people have unnecessarily died. And you can't bring a war to an end if you [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3387.6200000000003s)]

*  were in power far more than I did to the Republicans because they were conceding to the Republicans. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3652.82s)]
*  So it almost felt like I was shitting on the Republicans anyway. Okay. Make no mistake. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3657.3s)]
*  Members of this community and myself included shit on Donald Trump is because the initiatives [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3663.2200000000003s)]
*  he's taking is going to make your lives worse. Maybe one day you will understand that reality [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3667.7s)]
*  or maybe you will keep getting angrier and angrier, not recognizing why your conditions [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3674.18s)]
*  are worsening. Even though your great white savior is now in charge and he, you know, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3681.2999999999997s)]
*  banned transgenderism or whatever you think is pog and based. Okay. That's it. No matter how, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3686.66s)]
*  no matter how much people make it seem as though the anger and resentment towards Donald Trump is [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3695.94s)]
*  just simply on partisan boundaries or simply because they just don't like it. They hate America. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3702.9s)]
*  Liberals hate America. Leftists hate America. And they hate that like liberals hate America [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3709.06s)]
*  and they hate that Donald Trump is making America great. The real reasons as to why [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3714.9s)]
*  I am angry at Donald Trump is because he is stealing your money. Okay. You already don't [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3719.46s)]
*  make enough of it. He's allowing all of these dipshits in this room to steal more of your money. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3726.9s)]
*  That's it. Okay. Things are just going to get progressively worse and worse. Things that you [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3732.5800000000004s)]
*  rely on that the federal government actually gives you, they are going to, they're going to take away [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3737.3s)]
*  slowly but surely you are streamer brother. That's okay. Yes. I am a streamer. Even be president. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3744.18s)]
*  And I got the Olympics because if I didn't, when I spoke with the people, the organizing committee [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3753.7s)]
*  and the people in different parts of the world, they asked me to do it because the president [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3757.8599999999997s)]
*  wouldn't do it. I was president elect and I gave them a talk. I couldn't get them off the phone. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3762.5s)]
*  They were starving for love. And the bottom line, they gave us the Olympics. And I said, you know, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3766.8199999999997s)]
*  isn't it sad? I won't be president. Then we had the election result and now I'm president for the [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3771.46s)]
*  Olympics and for the world cup. So I'm very happy about that. Johnny, thank you very much. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3775.7s)]
*  Thank you. I'll be there. I promise I'll be there. And by the way, Mr. President backstage, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3781.78s)]
*  you have a gift from Johnny. He gave us the first ball with your name, which will be played for the [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3785.86s)]
*  cup. World cup. That's great. In America. It's going to be great. Thank you, John. Very much. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3793.78s)]
*  I doubt that any day you will take a sabbatical year, but if you could take a sabbatical year, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3798.6600000000003s)]
*  Mr. President, what unconventional thing would you do? What was the word? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3804.82s)]
*  Sabbatical. You don't work for one year. So you said Sabbath. It's a big difference. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3809.0600000000004s)]
*  That's almost the opposite. When you think about it, right? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3813.94s)]
*  I think what I do is look what I'm doing now. Why would that be the opposite? The most exciting [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3818.1000000000004s)]
*  job in the world. It's a hard job, not an easy job. It's a nasty job. It could be a lot easier [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3823.54s)]
*  with, you know, I think that the the news media has to straighten themselves out because people [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3829.38s)]
*  are getting it. You know, they they're losing tremendous popularity and they've lost their [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3835.06s)]
*  prestige and they've lost their credibility. And I think it's a very important thing, the news media, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3839.94s)]
*  but I think they have to straighten themselves out because the people are going around them. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3846.2599999999998s)]
*  Now they have so many different things with like Elon with X, which was a big a big thing. And we [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3850.18s)]
*  have truth, which has been fantastic. And we have so many other things that you don't really [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3855.06s)]
*  need traditional. But I will tell you that there is just nothing I could do to enjoy my life, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3859.46s)]
*  whether it's that or anything else that you'd ask because this is the ultimate. I mean, I had [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3867.54s)]
*  to make a big decision and it was a very risky decision because if I would have lost, my life [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3872.02s)]
*  would have been a much different life. It would have been a very nasty life. They were going after [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3876.9s)]
*  me at levels that nobody's ever seen before. This is being on Jackson, not Abraham Lincoln. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3880.5s)]
*  You know, the historians say that the president that was treated the worst by far by the media [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3884.9s)]
*  and over this is him being actually honest where he's talking about like why he actually ran again. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3889.54s)]
*  They were treated really rough and Abraham Lincoln was second, but he had a civil war. You know, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3896.7400000000002s)]
*  you can understand that, but nobody was treated like me. Nobody Abraham Lincoln was shot. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3901.38s)]
*  The fuck are you talking about yourself? But there's nothing I'd like to do. I had to make [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3907.94s)]
*  in the year. You know what I mean? It wasn't grazed in the year. It was just like shot [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3912.5s)]
*  to the back of the dome. It was dangerous, actually very dangerous in so many different ways. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3916.58s)]
*  And I decided to do it. And I said, I have to win because if I don't, when I spoke to a friend of [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3920.98s)]
*  mine the other night, he said, you know, have you lost? It would have been very, it was actually [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3925.54s)]
*  Sean Hannity just before we did the interview last night. He said, boy, if you would have lost, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3929.54s)]
*  it would have you would have had a tough life. You would have had a very tough life. So it was, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3934.42s)]
*  there was a certain amount of courage involved in this decision to run. And, and it's a great honor [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3939.06s)]
*  to win by this much to win all seven swing states, the popular vote, popular vote doesn't get won [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3945.78s)]
*  that much by Republicans for whatever reason. I think that's changing because again, with a [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3950.9s)]
*  party of common sense and they're the party of some real bad things. And I think they'll change. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3955.3s)]
*  I think they have to change. It would be wonderful. I'm going to be having lunch with some of the [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3959.7000000000003s)]
*  Democrats next week. And it would be wonderful if we could work together. I think working together [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3963.54s)]
*  would be great, but they have to change. You can't get elected on the programs that they want. And [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3968.1000000000004s)]
*  that's one that's really what America wants to see. So there's nothing I'd rather do than what [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3972.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm doing right now. When we started this conference, Mr. President, when we started this [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3977.7000000000003s)]
*  conference, Yasser and I, his one hand is the current president told us, I want that to be the [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3984.74s)]
*  place where people will come to understand where to invest in terms of geographies and sector. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3989.3799999999997s)]
*  So what is it made in your personal growth, Mr. President? Well, I was involved in real estate from, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=3995.9399999999996s)]
*  you know, most of my life and was, you know, guys like Witcoff will tell you I was really good at it [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4002.66s)]
*  and I was successful at it, very successful at it. I've been involved in things prior to being [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4009.2999999999997s)]
*  president, but during the four years, during the last four years, you know, I followed sort of the [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4015.7799999999997s)]
*  trends and I've made a lot of money with following some of these trends. And, you know, it's again, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4020.66s)]
*  it's something that you do. It's I really believe that some people- Luckily, they're calling it meme [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4028.3399999999997s)]
*  coin. They're calling it a rug pull. I did it. I love pulling the rug. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4033.86s)]
*  ... television. I wrote books and they were all bestsellers. Virtually every book was a [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4039.46s)]
*  big bestseller, some really big bestsellers. And so I don't know, it's whatever I do, I just want [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4045.1400000000003s)]
*  to make it successful. It's very important to me. There are many ways to make money. You can be in [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4050.6600000000003s)]
*  many different fields and a lot of them is being in the right country. You know, if you're in a [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4054.34s)]
*  certain country, our country is actually getting very bad, a very dangerous place, actually. Bad [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4060.34s)]
*  things were happening. But if you're in a certain country, you have a chance to do well. And no [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4067.38s)]
*  matter how good you are, if you were born into the wrong country, you're not going to make money. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4072.34s)]
*  Now you can do other things. You can attain power, I guess. Maybe it's the wrong kind of power, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4076.5s)]
*  but it's power. But being in the right country where you have the right incentives and, you know, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4081.7000000000003s)]
*  entrepreneurship, et cetera. And America has always been sort of at the top or one of the top, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4088.58s)]
*  but always pretty much at the top. But it was losing that position. And I think losing it [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4094.74s)]
*  rapidly. This last administration, look, I don't want to be, I wish I could say, I wouldn't have [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4101.46s)]
*  run. If I thought Biden was doing a good job, if I thought they were, I wouldn't have run. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4106.1s)]
*  You literally earlier said you ran because if you didn't run and you didn't win, you would have been [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4111.7s)]
*  in jail. That was 35 seconds ago. But it was dangerous in a lot of different ways. But he was [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4117.54s)]
*  so bad that I had no choice but to do it. If I thought he was doing a great job, I wouldn't have [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4125.54s)]
*  run and I would be very happy. I actually wanted him to do a good job. I was saying, do this, do [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4130.1s)]
*  that. I'm telling them, do things. They should have done what I said. And, but I would have been, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4135.7s)]
*  I would have been very happy not to have run and frankly to have seen somebody do a good job. But [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4140.98s)]
*  our country was going to hell and I really sort of had to run. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4147.0599999999995s)]
*  If you were a historical ruler, would you prefer to rule during war or peace? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4152.5s)]
*  Well, I want to be again a peacemaker and I want to keep us out of war. But [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4158.419999999999s)]
*  sometimes to do that, you have to have a very strong country. You have to have a very strong [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4163.54s)]
*  military. And as I said, we have a much stronger military than anyone would know. We have the best [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4167.22s)]
*  equipment and I bought a lot of it. I rebuilt our military in the first four years. I rebuilt it. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4172.58s)]
*  We gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan, to the Taliban, stupidly, but that's a very small [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4177.780000000001s)]
*  amount relative. It was billions and billions, but it's still a very small amount relatively [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4183.3s)]
*  to what we built. But I rebuilt, largely rebuilt our military. Now I'm going to have to do it again [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4187.860000000001s)]
*  because so much has been given away. So much has been treated so badly. But to keep peace, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4193.06s)]
*  you really have to, I have a thing, strength through, and I mean it, you really have it. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4200.1s)]
*  You have strength and you need the strength, but it's really peace through strength because [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4206.1s)]
*  without the strength, it's going to be very hard to have peace because you're going to be taking [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4210.02s)]
*  over. Bad things are going to happen. So you really want to have peace through strength. And that's [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4214.1s)]
*  where I've been. Having strength, having power in that sense to protect yourself and your people [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4218.58s)]
*  is a very important thing. Hopefully you don't have to use that power. I will tell you, I was [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4225.46s)]
*  dealing with President Putin very successfully on denuclearization. We were talking about it very [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4229.299999999999s)]
*  seriously and then COVID came and lots of things came and we had also talked to China about it. Now [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4235.78s)]
*  Russia and us have the biggest nuclear by far. China is not close, but they will be close. In [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4242.18s)]
*  three or four years or five years, they'll be equal. But we were going to talk to China and I [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4248.9s)]
*  spoke to President Xi about it very successfully. I think we were going to denuclearize it. We [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4255.14s)]
*  had to get the smaller nuclear powers, of which there are four, three maybe, but four probably, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4260.18s)]
*  to do something. We would have been able to do that. But I was having very strong talks with [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4267.54s)]
*  President Putin about denuclearization. And if you're president, you get presentations about [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4272.34s)]
*  what we're building, what we're having, the power of weapons, the power of many things [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4279.7s)]
*  besides weapons per se. What I saw, the power of nuclear weapons, and we can never let that happen. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4284.42s)]
*  If that happens, the ballgame will be, the world will be destroyed. The power is so enormous. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4293.14s)]
*  You look at Hiroshima, you look at Nagasaki. It would be pretty sick if they denuclearized, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4302.9800000000005s)]
*  right? Is the question from the chat. Yeah, it would also be pretty sick if there was [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4310.42s)]
*  nationalized health care in this country. Just because something is pretty sick or that Trump is [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4315.62s)]

*  We're remotely interested in following through on that. If that happened, the power of weaponry [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4326.58s)]
*  today is so enormous that the world would disintegrate. So we can't let it happen. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4330.66s)]
*  Mr. President, if you had to describe the United States of America in just three words, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4339.9400000000005s)]
*  what would they be? In three words? Three words. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4344.82s)]
*  Love, respect, and strength. That's a tough question. That might be my best answer, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4352.5s)]
*  Yasser. That's, that reminds me of high school, that one. But that may have been the toughest [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4359.62s)]
*  question, actually. Do you think Joe Biden could have done that? I don't think. Bro, these questions [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4365.3s)]
*  are so insane. They're asking him like baby questions. Like what historical figure do you [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4369.78s)]
*  mostly resemble cultural habit in the United in the U S business that the rest of the world [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4376.98s)]
*  could learn from? What is the best practice that well, I think we love our families, but I think a [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4384.0199999999995s)]
*  lot of the world loves their families. I was speaking to the head of Mexico because I complain [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4388.5s)]
*  constantly about people pouring in Americans. Americans famously love their families, dude, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4394.82s)]
*  in comparison to other countries, especially we're speaking to the president of Mexico, a very [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4400.259999999999s)]
*  wonderful woman, actually. And, Oh, she likes Claudia talking about drugs. You can't let people [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4406.9s)]
*  come through your country and come into the country. You know, it was not that nice, but [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4412.9s)]
*  they understood what I was saying. And she said something that really got me. She said, I said, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4417.139999999999s)]
*  are you a you're not a big drug taking nation? And she said, No, we are not a consumer. And I [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4422.02s)]
*  said a consumer. What is an interesting word? We're not a consumer nation. We're not a consumer [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4428.42s)]
*  of drugs. I said, What an interesting and why? Why is that? He said, she said, Well, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4434.26s)]
*  we have very strong family values. I said, But we do too. We do too. We have very strong. Our [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4438.740000000001s)]
*  families are devastated by what's happening with fentanyl and China will not be doing. We're going [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4443.700000000001s)]
*  to make a deal with China. They were not letting that happen anymore. And I had a deal, by the way, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4449.46s)]
*  before I left, I had a deal with President Xi where they were going to give the maximum penalty [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4455.14s)]
*  to anybody making fentanyl and sending it into the United States. And their maximum penalty is [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4459.54s)]
*  the death penalty and it would have stopped. But when the election turned out to be a rigged [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4464.66s)]
*  election, but that's okay. When election turned out to be, it was an election that shouldn't have [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4469.22s)]
*  happened. All the things that happened. I'll give you an example. We wouldn't have had October 7th [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4474.9s)]
*  Israel attack. We wouldn't have had Ukraine and Russia fighting. We wouldn't have had inflation. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4481.94s)]
*  We wouldn't have had all of these things that happened. But in speaking with her, she said about [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4486.58s)]
*  family values. I said, Well, you're not really saying anything there because we have great [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4493.0599999999995s)]
*  families too. We have great family values. She said, Plus, we advertise a lot. I said, Ooh, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4497.0599999999995s)]
*  you mean you advertise about how bad drugs are? Yes, we do. We spend a lot of money on advertising. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4502.900000000001s)]
*  And I said, Unbelievable. That was such a great conversation because we're going to spend hundreds [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4507.22s)]
*  of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don't use them, that they chew [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4512.34s)]
*  up your brain. They destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything. Yeah, that really worked with the [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4517.38s)]
*  dare program. Historically successful calls and I never learned anything from anybody. I know [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4522.74s)]
*  everything. And I remember how historically successful there was. As soon as she said it, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4527.46s)]
*  she didn't have to say exactly what I said. Exactly. What a great idea. And I think we're [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4532.26s)]
*  going to have a nice pieces of it. We're going to go in with 100 million dollars and then another [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4537.7s)]
*  100 million dollars initially. But I saw some of the ads and they are really violent. I said, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4541.9400000000005s)]
*  You have to make them strong. Your skin practically comes off after a period of time. You lose your [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4547.3s)]
*  hearing. You lose your teeth. You lose. I mean, you it is terrible. And we show this happening to [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4552.58s)]
*  people. And I think we're going to you know, we did very well with we had blue ribbon committees [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4559.86s)]
*  headed up by the First Lady of the United States and a lot of other people that did the viciousness [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4566.5s)]
*  of these cartels and these people and the smarts. I mean, they're very smart, tough people making a [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4571.94s)]
*  fortune, by the way, an absolute fortune. But we got it down 18 percent, which was a record. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4578.0199999999995s)]
*  But 18 percent is not great. When you think about it, I think we could get it down 50 or 55 or maybe [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4584.42s)]
*  even 60 percent with advertising. So she really gave me something I was going to call her and tell [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4589.78s)]
*  her that she did. But now I don't have to call her because she's going to be seeing this right now. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4595.46s)]
*  So to the president of Mexico, thank you very much. I appreciate it. But we're going to do a [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4599.62s)]
*  great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you. Wow. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4603.78s)]
*  My last question, Mr. President, you have mentioned briefly in your speech about the legacy. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4612.179999999999s)]
*  The question was, what can other businessmen learn from American business? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4618.18s)]
*  I came into a country that was great, but is in trouble. And I made America great. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4625.22s)]
*  What was your legacy? What would you like your legacy to be? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4632.26s)]
*  Trouble is the question. People respect America now. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4634.1s)]
*  And we were a country of peace and we brought peace to the rest of the world. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSXkUlcStk&t=4637.54s)]
