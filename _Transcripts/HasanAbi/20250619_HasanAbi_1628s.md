# This Lie About Iranian Women Is DISGUSTING | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM)
*  I didn't say that. I didn't. I was just repeating what she said. I was just laughing, but I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=0.0s)]
*  also shaking my head disapprovingly at what she said. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=15.24s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=19.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=21.36s)]
*  Oh, I wanted to show you guys this thing instead. Hold on. Babe, wake up the sleeper cells. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=25.16s)]
*  A feminist regime change have been activated. As much as I do not want to get dragged into [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=36.56s)]
*  Israel's beef with Iran, I don't want to see, I don't want to see you posting Iran as the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  right to protect itself. If you were raising awareness about the masa, a mini protest two [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  years ago, in the meantime, please pick up a copy of the handmaid's tale, which was inspired [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=50.36s)]
*  by the Iranian revolution in 1979. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=54.36s)]
*  God, white women, men, white women, agents of regime change POV, you're a gen X woman [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=56.92s)]
*  and you're old enough to remember when I told her, I told her home. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=66.48s)]
*  Homeni robbed Iran of their freedom. I dedicate this little dancy dance to my Iranian gen [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=70.92s)]
*  X sisters who remembered the taste of freedom as little girls chucked those hijabs. Ladies [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=77.88s)]
*  says gen X, gen X, auntie cat already seeing out of touch. American's angry at Israel for [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=84.76s)]
*  attacking Iran. Like, do they not realize Iran is like a literal handmaid's tale dystopia? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=92.28s)]
*  Or is it slow? Maybe it's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=98.68s)]
*  Ayatollah, like iodine as amazing. Yeah. Don't you know the greatest way to girl boss, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=105.4s)]
*  liberate women in Iran is by killing all of them. Excuse me. Don't you know the best possible [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  way for women's liberation to take place in Iran is by doing a decapitation strike while [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=120.92000000000002s)]
*  simultaneously allowing B2 bombers to drop bunker buster bombs in the four down nuclear facility [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=126.84s)]
*  that is deep underground with numerous, with numerous and precise and maybe some imprecise [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=133.56s)]
*  strikes. This is the best possible way to liberate the Iranian women. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  Sweetie. Do you see genocide stands with Iran? Jenna or take a show saw there with the people [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  at LA, Palestine, Iran, and new Instagram story. The world is crying all over people in Los [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=148.52s)]
*  Angeles being torn away from their everyday lives and Lord, this is why times of Israel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=152.2s)]
*  famously considered Jenna or take it to be as deeply of an anti-Semitic person as [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=156.2s)]
*  Kanye West. That's a real article. The times of Israel wrote, by the way, they arrived at the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  conclusion that Jenna or take it was actually a more insidious, a more dangerous anti-Semite than [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=165.32s)]
*  Kanye West making valid points about Israel's depravity. My thoughts are heavy. My heart [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  Palestinian cries are still being buried in everyday media. My thoughts are heavy. My heart [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=176.44s)]
*  follows. It is normal to feel confused and hopeless during this time, but I strongly advise [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=179.48s)]
*  you never stop paying attention. How can we care about anything else? Is human freedom [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=183.24s)]
*  spanning across the sea or being violated with such violence? Listen to another and love, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=185.72s)]
*  but be angry to educate yourself as best as you can to say this doesn't concern you [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=189.16s)]
*  or that it is in your problem is a privilege under abuse. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Where did they say? Where's she talking about Iran? Oh, innocent civilians in Iran are caught [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=197.88s)]
*  in the middle of warfare. Someone reminds me of someone who said that about you and Fuentes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  Always that shit. Yeah, we already covered the Guardian on Iran's Fordo facility. We also covered [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=205.08s)]
*  that the Trump administration came out and said, no, all options are on the table, including a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=210.68s)]
*  the Israeli occupying force already did try to kill the Iranian foreign minister. Just like you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  said they would earlier. Muslim Mohammed was saying ranch, but on the advisor, the Iranian [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=220.28s)]
*  foreign minister confirmed that a major Israeli plot to foreign foreign minister Abbas actually [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=225.0s)]
*  was foiled. Ron's Brian noted that the operation was full. Thanks to measurements carried out by [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=228.84s)]
*  the Iranian intelligence. Yeah, by the way, when someone says they're going to use a tactical, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  just know that that just means they're going to use it like there is no, there is no such thing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=238.6s)]
*  Okay. Tactical is just by another name. And as far as I understand, far more powerful than [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=243.56s)]
*  the previous that the United States of America has used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Would Russia [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  be more emboldened to use of USA Iran? Would this make Iran fast track making it? Would China make [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=257.56s)]
*  a move on Taiwan? Oh my God, Taiwan. Come on, dude. Yes. A tactical is still many times more [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=262.28s)]
*  powerful than the previous that were used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Wouldn't being it wouldn't [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=269.0s)]
*  using it to be detrimental to the whole world. Yes. Okay. Here is here's the view getting spicy [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=275.0s)]
*  with it. Let's watch. And it's slow. Talking about Iran, the ladies got spicy with it. The [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=280.76s)]
*  Iranians literally throw gay people off of buildings. They don't adhere to basic human rights. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=287.4s)]
*  You say a correct thing about Israel. People call you an anti-Semite for hours and hours and days. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=292.67999999999995s)]
*  Okay. And they demand your deplatforming. You go on the view and you're like, Iranians are doing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=297.88s)]
*  ISIS style assassination attempts on homosexuals. And everyone's like, Oh, well, that's true. But [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  no, bitch, it ain't true. What the you mean? It's like seven seconds in. Are you kidding me? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=310.28s)]
*  They say this about every Muslim country, dude. What the every Muslim country in Gaza, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=316.11999999999995s)]
*  they throw the babies off the roof when they find out the baby is gay. Yeah, that's what they're [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=322.12s)]
*  doing. That's crazy. It feels like they're doing it in every Muslim country. It almost feels like [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=329.32s)]
*  you're just racist, dude. Also, what an insane statement because your solution is what to kill [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=334.6s)]
*  the gay people with American weapons instead. Let's not do that. Let's not do that. Because if we [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=340.76s)]
*  start with that, we have been known in this country to tie gay folks to the car. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=348.6s)]
*  They're just hanging black people. So it is not even the same. I couldn't step. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=359.16s)]
*  Oh, no. That's not what you mean. Whoopi actually brings up a very good point, which is, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=364.44s)]
*  do you think it would be justifiable for the USS R to the United States of America? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=371.56s)]
*  Because there was segregation implemented in the United States of America. Do you think it would [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  be valid for the USS R after nuclear proliferation to the entire countryside for, you know, hanging [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=383.56s)]
*  black people with with lynch mobs? Say it is the same. No, it's not. The year 2025, the United States [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=394.36s)]
*  is nothing like if I step foot wearing this. I can't have my hair showing. I can't wear a skirt. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=401.64s)]
*  I can't have my arms. I'm telling you, as I literally can't wear my skirt in Tehran. I can't [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=409.88s)]
*  eat kubi day. Whoopi. Don't you understand? I can't wear bikini to the beach. So obviously, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=418.44s)]
*  they all need to die. We need to kill them. I can't wear my skirt to beach and eat kubi day. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's why I am saying that it is the same. Also, what was she saying is not even completely [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  correct, but I'm not even going to get into it because people love to latch onto this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=451.8s)]
*  Any sort of course correction about like the day to day existence in Iran, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=459.32000000000005s)]
*  okay, is immediately met with tremendous response because most people are operating off of this [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=463.72s)]
*  false notion as well. So they just genuinely will go, what do you mean? Are you saying it's a paradise [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=469.88000000000005s)]
*  for women? Are you saying it's the most pro-women country on the planet? How dare you? How do you [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=477.32s)]
*  say that? I'm saying this as someone who has tried to perhaps unsuccessfully combat Islamophobia [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=484.44s)]
*  for the past 10 to 12 years at this point. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=495.88s)]
*  Yeah. Did you guys know that there's a country in the region where if a woman is raped [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=507.56s)]
*  and in the aftermath of being raped, if she cannot sufficiently prove that she was not [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=522.28s)]
*  asking for it, okay, that she actually still goes to jail and could even be killed in the process? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=530.92s)]
*  A Muslim country. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=544.6s)]
*  Do you know which country this is? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not Iran, it's Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia is our ally. So God forbid [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=552.36s)]
*  and for the record, I wouldn't be advocating to Saudi Arabia for that reason either. Okay. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=564.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=570.52s)]
*  Crazier fight against antisemitism has gone better than your fight against Islamophobia. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=580.28s)]
*  Come here. I don't know. I don't know if I'm making an impact on the fighting against antisemitism [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=584.4399999999999s)]
*  either. I feel like it's a, there's a overwhelmingly powerful force of antisemitism that's growing [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=588.28s)]
*  directly as a consequence of people associating Israel's disgusting affairs in the region with [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=594.76s)]
*  Judaism and Jews in the United States of America. Sometimes that conflation is being made in a lot [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=600.6s)]
*  of instances. As a matter of fact, it's being made by Jews in the media, ironically enough, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  which is running around and being like, I love ISIS. ISIS is like actually true Islam. It's in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=610.6s)]
*  the name. How dare you criticize ISIS actions. That's Islamophobic. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=616.44s)]
*  Murdering someone for their difference is not good. Whoever does it. It's not good. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  So that's why I said you weren't saying what I heard was not what you meant. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=635.48s)]
*  I think it's very different to live in the United States in 2025 than it is to live in Iran. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=642.6s)]
*  Not for everybody. Not if you're black. Guys, don't go to Tehran. Do not any. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=646.92s)]
*  Let me tell you about. Oh my God. She's still talking about the Quran. This is just pure [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=652.76s)]
*  Islamophobia. What are you saying? Is Turkey like that? I mean, is Iran even like that to the extent [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=658.68s)]
*  that she claims it is? It's not, by the way, the answer is no. There are definitely regions where, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=665.8s)]
*  there are definitely regions where even the Islamic Republic has had to forcibly, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  forcibly have to back away. Oh, she said, oh, she said, have you been to Tehran? Oh, ironically [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=677.48s)]
*  enough, many parts of Tehran are exactly what I'm talking about, where you can freely not cover [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=687.08s)]
*  your hair. You don't need to cover your hair. So she's literally wrong on that front. I thought [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=693.48s)]
*  she said, have you read the Quran? There have been times of state repression and major, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=699.48s)]
*  major chaos unfolded as a direct consequence of that only a couple of years prior. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=718.28s)]
*  Here's what Iranian girls think. Watch the very end. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=722.36s)]
*  She says, they told us to evacuate our city, but we're not going anywhere. We're living our lives [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=734.76s)]
*  unless we take our bodies out of here down with Israel. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=737.88s)]

*  repressive forces in the country for sure. But to say that Iranian women are not educated is [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=929.8000000000001s)]
*  literally the most wrong thing you can say. Iranian women are more educated than American [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=938.6800000000001s)]

*  okay, barely literate, don't can't even speak one language, okay, let alone multiple. And they just [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=964.7600000000001s)]

*  wow. Oh, wow. Iran literacy rate for 2022 was 89%. Let's look at the American literacy rate. 79% [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=992.76s)]
*  is one Google Iranian women are 60% of Iranian university students and 70% of STEM graduates. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1006.04s)]
*  Like this right here, get mocked America. This right here, by the way, is just racism through [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1011.64s)]
*  and through for the record. This is exactly the same principle that white supremacists had towards [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1019.3199999999999s)]
*  black people. The notion that like black people are just, you know, lesser than white people [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1026.36s)]
*  for no real reason other than just like they thought it. Okay. They kept black people down [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1033.0s)]
*  and then they were like, all right, yeah. And they're just lesser. They're just lesser. They're [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1040.3600000000001s)]
*  inferior. It's the same exact shit. The reason why I'm using black white dynamics here is because [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1043.3200000000002s)]
*  Americans only understand like barely, but only understand anti-black racism. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1049.88s)]

*  about access under authoritarian regimes, not the capabilities and achievements of Iranian women. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1117.4s)]

*  intervention and American involvement. Oh my Lord. Whether it be the Iranian revolution or whether it [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1165.5600000000002s)]

*  to integrate into society. You keep black people underserved. And then you act as though there is [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1192.76s)]

*  And when people rise up and resist, the most successful factors of resistance are fundamentalist [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1216.36s)]
*  oftentimes because those fundamentalist forms of resistance are seen as the most [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAN2OJ2EhxM&t=1222.6799999999998s)]
