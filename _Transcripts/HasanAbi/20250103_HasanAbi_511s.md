# Mike Johnson Is Back | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ)
*  If I'm a partisan, I don't really care that the Democrat is just sitting up there being like, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=0.0s)]
*  we are going to do bipartisanship. If I'm a Democrat, I don't fully understand why [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=7.2s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries is kind of glazing the limited accomplishments of the Biden administration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=13.92s)]
*  But let's get started. Breaking news. Michael P. has won his reelection as House Speaker. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=20.08s)]
*  We will work with anyone of any party to get that done. We will work with anyone [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=33.76s)]
*  to secure our borders and we will work with anyone to fix our broken and a comprehensive [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=40.4s)]
*  hell yeah. That's right. Border control. We want it. I'm a Democrat by the way. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=47.04s)]
*  This ain't this ain't your father's Democratic Party. This is your grandfather's Democratic [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=55.36s)]
*  Party from the South, a Dixie credit party. That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=61.84s)]
*  we don't like Mexicans. Okay. That's right. This is not your father's Democratic Party. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=66.24s)]
*  This is not your Democratic Party is your grandpappy's Democratic Party from the South, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=73.52s)]
*  specifically a Dixie credit party. We are now fully in fully in the bosom. We are now firmly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=78.24s)]
*  invested in being the diet Republican Party baby. Let's go earn those benefits, worked hard [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=86.8s)]
*  for those benefits and deserve those benefits. So as Democrats, our promise to the American people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  is that we will fight hard to make sure that no one in this town takes away Social Security [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=105.36s)]
*  or Medicare from the American people. Not now, not ever. No means never. Hey everyone, there's a CIA [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  masterclass. That's crazy. Our position is that it is not acceptable to cut Social Security, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=122.56s)]
*  cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut veterans benefits or cut nutritional assistance from children and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=129.84s)]
*  families in order to pay for massive tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=139.2s)]
*  House Democrats will fight hard to protect working class Americans and the things that matter to them, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=147.52s)]
*  not the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected. Keep your hands off Social Security. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=155.84s)]
*  Wait, he didn't win. Hakeem Jeffries didn't win. He's just delivering a speech. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=162.96s)]
*  Mike Johnson, Michael Penis won his reelection as House Speaker. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=167.2s)]
*  Four years, it's been a great honor for us to work alongside President Joe Biden and Vice President [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris, whose administration rescued the economy from a once-in-a-century pandemic, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=177.92s)]
*  delivered historic infrastructure investments, created more than 15 million good-paying jobs, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=186.64s)]
*  enacted common-sense gun safety legislation for the first time in 30 years, provided life-sustaining [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=195.52s)]
*  health insurance to veterans suffering from toxic exposure, championed the largest investment in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=204.0s)]
*  combating the climate crisis in the history of the world, which we will defend and brought down [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=211.52s)]
*  the high price of life-saving prescription drugs for millions of Americans. Thank you, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  President Biden and Vice President Harris, for your powerful, principled and purposeful [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=222.96s)]
*  public service. Thank you. Two months ago, the American people elected Donald Trump [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=228.88s)]
*  as the 47th President of the United States of America. Thank you for that very generous [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  applause. It's okay. There are no election deniers on our side of the aisle. You see, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  one should love America. One should love America when you win and when you lose. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=245.2s)]
*  That's the patriotic thing to do, and that's the America that House Democrats will fight hard to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=254.88s)]
*  preserve because we love this country. America is bigger than any one campaign, any one election, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=260.88s)]
*  or any one individual. I really like shooting guns. America, the land of the free. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=270.08s)]
*  This is a funny video. Yeah. Let us never forget that our country is free. Not soon. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=275.12s)]
*  I don't know who they do this for. Honestly, like who, who is the target audience for this? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=281.68s)]
*  Because if I'm a corporate investor, okay. If I am an oligarch, I don't care. Cause I bought both [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=290.48s)]
*  parties. So I'm not tuning in. If I'm a partisan, I don't really care that the Democrat is just [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=299.84s)]
*  sitting up there being like, we are going to do bipartisanship. If I'm a Democrat, I don't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=307.84s)]
*  fully understand why Hakeem Jeffries is kind of glazing the limited accomplishments of the Biden [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  administration and also simultaneously talking about bipartisanship, even though, you know, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=322.0s)]
*  the Democrats lost a resounding defeat, a resounding victory for the Republican party. So [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=329.92s)]
*  none of that really matters. So who are they keeping up these appearances for is a question [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=336.96s)]
*  I always have like, who is this for? Who, who tunes into this and goes, man, what a brilliant [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=344.4s)]
*  speech by Hakeem Jeffries. This is the new leadership of the democratic party. And it's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=351.84s)]
*  actually very exciting. This is, this excites me. I don't know. I just, I don't know. Maybe there's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=358.64s)]
*  some grandmothers out there that tune into MSNBC that are still watching and haven't had their [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=365.12s)]
*  brains fried from the devastating defeat that the democratic party withstood in this election [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=369.76s)]
*  cycle. I just always feel like they stand up here and clap for one another because they just, you [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=377.36s)]
*  know, kind of have to keep up these appearances, but for the sake of themselves and nobody else, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=386.4s)]
*  really just for themselves. It's the same exact attitude of like giving Liz Cheney a, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=392.4s)]
*  a medal, an award for her brilliant accomplishments. Right? Joe Biden did that yesterday [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=399.28s)]
*  and, and she received the standing ovation, thunderous applause. Everyone was excited. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=407.04s)]
*  They were like, Oh man, so incredible that Liz Cheney deserved, she was deserving of this medal, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=414.0s)]
*  this honor. So I guess I'm left wondering like, who is that for? What is that for? Who is the target [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=419.68s)]
*  audience for this? Maybe they just have too much free time. They just have too much free time on [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=426.88s)]
*  their hand. There's plenty of, there's plenty of daylight. There's plenty of time to just do like [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=431.6s)]
*  silly stuff such as that. And it is a constant, it's a steady maintenance of a, of an institution [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=435.52s)]
*  that is genuinely falling apart every single day, day in, day out. It's just, it's crippled at every [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  step of the way. And Republicans truly take advantage of that. They take advantage of that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=451.28s)]
*  and seek to undermine it further for their own agendas, deregulation, tax cuts, things of that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=457.84s)]
*  nature, you know, but here, here's another moment of like theatrics that I thought was odd here. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  Stand right there. That is not your nature to stand where you're told to stand, but give it a try. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=471.2s)]
*  Bernie gets so bullied and I'm sick of it. Yeah. Stop bullying the old man. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKlM4IjO1gQ&t=501.2s)]
