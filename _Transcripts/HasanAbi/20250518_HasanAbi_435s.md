**HasanAbi:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE)
*  Told you I told you he was too old [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=0.0s)]
*  This guy was so old the Democrats propped him up the Democrats propped him up [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=2.84s)]
*  Knowing he was so old. They probably gave him cancer. Nancy Pelosi gave Joe Biden cancer [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=9.68s)]
*  believe it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=16.52s)]
*  Oh [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=23.04s)]
*  Biden is he gonna cry? Oh my god. Is he gonna cry? Did he cry already for him as he is pulled for and prayed for? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=25.72s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm interrupting the daily wire broadcast for a brief moment [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=32.24s)]
*  I have to see this cry a little bit. I heard all these stories [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=35.44s)]
*  But just you have personal stories about how he'd pick up the phone and call people [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=38.28s)]
*  members of someone's family that are dealing with a cancer diagnosis or who are in need of somebody to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Comfort them or whatever the case may be and then of course [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=48.96s)]
*  He's lazy and is doing on Biden is so funny [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=52.0s)]
*  There's also presents [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  Jake Tapper in a unique predicament in a unique position because like he literally is ass-blasting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  No pun intended [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=65.84s)]
*  Joe Biden right now [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  Because of because of his own career ambitions him and Alex Thompson [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=69.92s)]
*  Have gotten together and written a book Alex Thompson was one of the reporters that actually criticized by the age Jake Tapper came in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=74.04s)]
*  After the fact after everybody was on board having said that Jake Tapper ever the ambitious media demon [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=81.44s)]
*  he is has joined in on the fun of ass-blasting Joseph Robinette Brandon again, no pun intended and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  And and therefore this is gonna kind of ruin their book tour [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  I think because they're going to say they're going to turn around and say like oh dude. Look at this. You're releasing this book [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=101.0s)]
*  Joe Brandon is not even dead yet. He can read it like you're gonna attack a man with cancer [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=108.52s)]
*  The second time I think that pun was intended. No, no, no now is 38 years old [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=114.64s)]
*  Joe Biden has been in public life for 50 years so longer than most Americans have been alive [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=119.36s)]
*  Joe Biden has been walking the halls [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=125.76s)]
*  marble halls [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=128.52s)]
*  Pressing the flesh trying to get things done for Americans cancer is just one of the many causes that he has championed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  But this one now it strikes very close to home [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=136.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think we do have a clip of him talking about this. I want to just play it the fight against cancer [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=138.12s)]
*  the fight to eliminate racial disparities cancer and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=144.44s)]
*  Claims he wants to fight against cancer gets cancer willing to postpone. Okay. Okay. I don't care him saying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=148.88s)]
*  He's gonna fight against cancer is meaningless [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=155.44s)]
*  Everybody says that it's like saying dude [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=157.8s)]
*  Dude [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=160.78s)]
*  Dude saying he's gonna cure cancer was one of his dumbest campaign promises who gives up [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=161.98s)]
*  Anyway, I'm sorry to see this news cancer is truly awful. My dad passed away in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=167.18s)]
*  2021 with cancer praise for Joe Biden and his family [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=172.7s)]

*  Yeah, this is he didn't write this. What is this? Oh [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCZvIG2KtzE&t=206.06s)]
