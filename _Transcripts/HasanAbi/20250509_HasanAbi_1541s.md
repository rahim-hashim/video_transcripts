*  you want to. Yeah, hold on. I'm going to show you. Uh, I, I have you hold on. How do I hide [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=111.0s)]

*  I'm trying to hide myself on the, on the pop-up, but I can't figure it out. Uh, but it's fine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  Whatever. We'll just do it live. We'll just do it live. All right. We're now everybody. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=132.24s)]
*  What's up everyone? What's up everyone? There you go. Okay. I see. I see myself. Why are [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=139.24s)]
*  you, why are you defending Pakistan? It's a good question. Uh, I don't know. They, they, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=144.6s)]
*  uh, how much should I know? The food spice here? How much did they pay? The cost for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=151.6s)]
*  chicken is much less. I don't know. The cost per chicken is much less. No, I'm just joking. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=156.76s)]
*  Uh, the chicken costs in Pakistan is much less than, uh, than in India, you know. How [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=161.28s)]
*  much did they pay you? Be honest. I'm well, you're a secret Muslim. We found out. Yeah, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  totally, man. Totally, totally. Uh, I think it was like, uh, 5 million rupees, which is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  like $5. Okay. So let me ask you this. Do you feel like my analysis on the situation [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=177.0s)]
*  is, is, uh, crazy when I say like, both of these nation states have their faults, uh, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=183.36s)]
*  have their own scandals, have their own corruption, have their own supremacist ideologies. Having [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=190.52s)]
*  said that I'd feel like so far I'm seeing a level of blood loss from India, both the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  population and the government and a need for escalation from the Indian government that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=201.0s)]
*  I, uh, I am a little bit worried about. You feel like you're not off base? No, you are, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=205.4s)]
*  you're generally in the right. So yes, India has been as a, I mean, I've been keeping up [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  with the news lately, uh, or with the Indian news coverage of everything and, uh, Murtaza [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  Hussain over at Dropsite had a really interesting take that I thought was happening for a little [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  bit, but I, it looks like I was wrong. Um, but you're generally right. Uh, yes, the, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  both Pakistan and India are effectively states that were created by the upper crusts of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=236.88s)]
*  subcontinent. Uh, and there's a lot of history behind how like Pakistan and India were actually [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  like created. Uh, Pakistan has since devolved into effectively a far right wing military [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  dictatorship, uh, that funds, militant groups sends them over to the border into Kashmir. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=255.6s)]
*  Right. And India has also, you know, for decades upon decades upon decades, there is, I mean, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  there is a market difference between India under Modi and India under, uh, you know, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=269.56s)]
*  Congress leaders such as Manmohan Singh and, and, uh, you know, other leaders proceeding [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=275.24s)]
*  Manmohan Singh, um, in that India was at least like, there was always an undercurrent of, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  uh, Hindu nationalism happening underneath, uh, which came to a head in the nineties when [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=287.68s)]
*  the Mundell commission happened. Okay. Well, hold on. I need you to address the Indian chatter. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=292.4s)]
*  Can we address the elephant of in the room of Arun, unknown Russia won't invade moment from the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=298.96s)]
*  last collab. Yeah. Okay. Listen, listen, I didn't think it was going to happen. I'm going to be 100. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=304.96s)]
*  I'm going to be 100% honest. I did not like, I didn't think it was going to happen. I, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=310.88s)]
*  I didn't look, okay. Okay. Don't worry about that. Here. Listen to him. He said [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=317.12s)]
*  India became this way because of India became this way because of Muslims. Muslims did this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=323.2s)]
*  Pakistan started this, this bloodlust dude, Pakistani army has done a, ask him how, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  ask him to show how this started. India was made like this because of Pakistan. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=332.8s)]
*  Hindutva existed before Mandel commission. Hindutva started with Muslim league. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=335.92s)]
*  Okay. He's right in that Hindu to existed before the Mundell commission. When I'm the, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=340.96s)]
*  the event that I'm referencing is the demolition of the Babri Masjid in the 90s [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=345.68s)]
*  that happened in the wake of the Mundell commission. That's what I'm talking about. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=351.52s)]
*  Okay. That is Hindu. Okay. So I was saying earlier, right? What Hindu is at its ultimate core, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  like if you've noticed almost every leader, I think every leader of, you know, the RSS, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=365.76s)]
*  the Rasya Swayamsevak Sangh has been Brahmins, right? They've always come from either some sort [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=370.96s)]
*  of upper cast or they're Brahmins, right? And why is that? And the reason is the way Hindutva or [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=377.76s)]
*  Hindu nationalism, they're the same thing. They're, they're effectively the same thing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=385.68s)]
*  The way they operate and their modus operandi is by blurring the divisions, the caste antagonisms [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=390.08s)]
*  that exist within India to basically attack Muslims and Christians, right? RSS is cast [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=397.84s)]
*  in extremist organization. Okay. So he, okay. I think this dude's like a lib or something. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=405.11999999999995s)]
*  I'm assuming he sounds like a lib to me, but Hindu Muslim happened before a mob, Babri dude, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=409.2s)]
*  there's okay. Let's talk about how India and Pakistan got partitioned a little bit. Okay. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=415.44s)]
*  A little bit of history. So you had one group of people called the Muslim League that was basically [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=421.2s)]
*  saying, Hey, Muslims are going to be persecuted under a Hindu majority India. Now that reasoning [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=430.0s)]
*  on its own is not incorrect, especially if you look at Modi right now, right? That's not an [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=437.6s)]
*  incorrect reasoning. But what was happening is that the most of the Muslim League, if you actually [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=443.76s)]
*  look at the leadership of the Muslim League, especially Muhammad Ali Jinnah, right? Who is the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=450.48s)]
*  the founder of Pakistan, right? He, they all came from basically upper caste Muslim backgrounds, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=454.96s)]
*  upper class Muslim backgrounds. And there was a counter movement to the, to the Muslim League at [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=463.52s)]
*  the time. That was basically, no, what about 70 years of secular rule? I just said that earlier, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=470.64s)]
*  boss. Boss, I said that yes, up until yes, everyone else was everyone that was from the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  Congress Party and up until that up until like, Modi until Modi took power and he also Vajpayee [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  took power. Vajpayee is BJP, right? Until those two guys took power. The Congress leaders are [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=493.12s)]
*  at least secular. They are, they are, they claim, they claim to be super secular and they are [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=500.24s)]
*  considerably more secular than yes, both the Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim League were going and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=504.72s)]
*  telling people to mark their religion as Hindu or Muslim. Now the problem is both Hindus, you know, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=512.32s)]
*  the caste system in Hinduism is extreme, right? It's the worst in Hinduism. But the thing is, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=518.16s)]
*  because caste is such an integral part of subcontinental society, it's penetrated every [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=525.68s)]
*  other religion, right? So Christians also practice caste, right? So Christians also practice [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  untouchability and so do Muslims in the subcontinent. They also practice untouchability [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=538.2399999999999s)]
*  in caste as well. So there was a counter movement to this, to the Muslim League saying, hey, we don't, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=544.7199999999999s)]
*  we are not represented by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It's called the moment conference. And they [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=554.0s)]
*  basically went to Nehru, who was the head of the Indian National Congress at the time, and they [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=559.2s)]
*  basically said, hey, listen, what Jinnah is doing is they are coming from elite backgrounds that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=563.92s)]
*  don't represent us. Now what happened was Nehru basically literally came back and said, yes, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=571.76s)]
*  we agree that the Muslim League is basically run by elite upper caste Muslims, right? But [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=578.96s)]
*  we have to go along with Partition because if we let you guys have a voice, if we let you guys have [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=589.76s)]
*  that sort of voice, then what will happen is the oppressed caste in our ranks in the Indian National [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  Congress will try and rise against us. So the only reason that Partition happened or Nehru actually [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=602.96s)]
*  agreed to Partition mainly was because it would actually reveal the caste antagonisms within this [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=608.96s)]
*  entire charade, right? And that's what I was trying to get at, right? With this chatter. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  By the way, we don't have to, we don't have to listen to this guy. I'm just, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  I know it's up to you. It's up the, it's all up to, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=625.12s)]
*  I mean, it's cathartic watching you yell at chatters. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I do. I mean, this is what I do. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=632.72s)]
*  And they're going to do code bill even after RSS opposition. Okay, dude, whatever. All right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=634.32s)]
*  Anyway, go on, go on with the way you were going to talk about. So that's how Partition actually [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=643.2s)]
*  kind of happened. So why, why are you hiding the truth that Pakistan is actually striking back [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=648.72s)]
*  extra hard and so much harder than India ever struck Pakistan? Oh yeah, totally, man. It's not [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=657.2s)]
*  like I've been saying in chat this entire time that Pakistan has been hitting Kashmir this entire [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=663.76s)]
*  time. They've been hitting Kashmiri villages, villages in Jammu and villages in Indian controlled [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=668.48s)]
*  Kashmir on the other side of the border. Yeah, totally, man. Totally, man. I've never said that, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=674.88s)]
*  dude, I'm so pro-Pakistan that I have, I'm so pro-Pakistan that I have genuinely backed the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=680.08s)]
*  Baloch Jatjiti committee, have criticized Pakistan for imprisoning Marang Baloch. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=688.48s)]
*  I've also criticized Pakistan vehemently for literally selling weapons to Sri Lanka. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  Like they're also complicit in the Tamil, maybe not to the same extent India is, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=702.0s)]
*  because India actually committed against the Tamils. But yeah, I'm totally pro-Pakistan. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=706.24s)]
*  Totally, man. Yeah, I'm totally pro-Pakistan. I've never criticized Pakistan before. Absolutely. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=710.48s)]
*  Also, the funny thing is, so when you had me last, right, you had, you also had Pakistanis [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=717.12s)]
*  criticizing me for saying, oh, Pakistan doesn't, Pakistan cares about Kashmiris. Kashmir is actually [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=722.08s)]
*  the jugular of Pakistan. You don't understand. We are ideologically aligned with Kashmir. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=729.04s)]
*  Yeah, totally, dude. That's why Pakistan, the Pakistani army just slaughtered 10 civilians [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=736.08s)]
*  across the line of control. Absolutely. Totally, man. Okay. But in terms of, in terms of attacks, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=740.24s)]
*  where the attacks are landing, what the severity of said attacks are, regardless of Pakistan also [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=747.44s)]
*  striking across the line of control, it seems as though India is directly striking inside of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=753.2800000000001s)]
*  Pakistan in a way where Pakistan, as far as I understand, and maybe I'm wrong in a way that [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  Pakistan has not returned the favor of on C sorry. One more thing. I will Indian speaking on Pakistan. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=764.56s)]
*  Great. You're fantastic. Okay. Well you pissed off everybody. At least the, at least Pakistan's is [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=771.8399999999999s)]
*  how do you say it? Zinsabad is called Zindabad. Zindabad means long live Zindabad Pakistan. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=779.1199999999999s)]
*  Zindabad. Andy's weren't yelling at me. Now they're yelling at me too. Yeah. My life for [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=784.88s)]
*  Pakistan chatters. You know this. Okay. Yeah. This is so stupid. Okay. Now you see the kind of brain [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  rod that I, that, that I have to deal with. No, it's awesome. I love it. It's like ball and chatters [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=801.2800000000001s)]
*  is exactly like Balkan chatters. I've seen before is like Balkan. This is like if Balkan chatters [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=806.48s)]
*  are like turned up times 10. Oh yeah. It's worse. It's worse than it's, it's way worse. At least the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  Balkan chatters don't have a cast system. Like it's ethnic conflict. It's religious conflict [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=819.76s)]
*  and there's hundreds of years of history, but at least they don't have a cast structure on top of [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=825.12s)]
*  that. Oh yeah. And also like Pakistan also has a cast structure. Like every, every nation in the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=829.12s)]
*  subcontinent has some sort of cast structure. Sri Lanka has it. India has it. Pakistan also has it, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=836.88s)]
*  it operates obviously very differently depending on the country and depending on the region, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=844.08s)]
*  but every like you're wrong. Albania is on the bottom of the cast. Yeah. Okay. Fair. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=848.64s)]
*  There's a, there's also Indian, Indian Muslim politicians. There's a guy called [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=857.6s)]
*  us. What was it? I saw the denoise who was literally like yelling. He had like a, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=862.08s)]
*  does anyone have that link of a saddened in Oasis literally going up and yelling like [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  a Hindustan Zindabad Pakistan, mudabad, right? Mudabad means death to a debt. Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=873.3599999999999s)]
*  So there is a broader Indian nationalism though, like that goes beyond Hindu to a fascism that is, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=883.76s)]
*  it's very scary because it feels like, it feels like they're, they're emboldened and galvanized [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=890.56s)]
*  through like state versus state violence. So they've been able to reframe the conflict, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=897.6s)]
*  not against like Hindus versus Muslims, but instead to India versus Pakistan. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=903.36s)]
*  Yes. I mean, that's the thing. So the thing with Indian, Indian civic nationalism, as a lot of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=910.24s)]
*  people call it, or is this Indian liberalism, right? So basically like Indian liberalism has [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=915.44s)]
*  always been, you know, basically pro-Indian state, no matter what, when, when it comes to issues like [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=924.24s)]
*  Kashmir, right? Like Kashmir is like the one issue you cannot really, or Pakistan for that matter, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=929.28s)]
*  you cannot, you really cannot question like, like even in the wake of the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  Pahulgama attacks, the way, like the way Indian liberals basically framed the entire discussion [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=944.4s)]
*  was, Hey, why was there such a security breach? Which is like, you just correct, right? It's a [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=950.56s)]
*  correct thing to question, right? Why was there such a security breach in Pahulgama? No, I think [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=954.7199999999999s)]
*  that's why I have a tin foil. My tin foil conspiracy is that Pakistan and China have too sweet of a [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=959.92s)]
*  deal. And that America wanted America wanted, I mean, this is, I'm making this up. I, this is [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=968.7199999999999s)]
*  we will, we will speculation. I don't think America is involved in this. I think like, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=975.9200000000001s)]
*  I think they were like, yeah, get in there, do some crazy shit. And then they were like, India, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=980.8000000000001s)]
*  go ahead. India, Zindabad, Zindabad, fuck them up. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=985.44s)]
*  I'm false flag-filled. You probably, instead of Hindustan, Zindabad, you might hear Jai Hind. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=993.6s)]
*  Jai Hind, or like, if you really want to turn up the fascists, you can say Bharat Mata Ki Jai. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=998.4s)]
*  What does that mean? Bharat Mata Ki Jai? Bharat Mata Ki Jai is long live or victory to mother [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1003.92s)]
*  India, basically. Okay. Bharat Mata means mother India. Jai means victory. So victory to mother [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1011.6s)]
*  India. Okay. Chatters are actually getting mad at me for saying, this is not about you, man. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  Please talk about the issue. Then go. You're so serious, really losing credibility. Actually, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1026.8s)]
*  they might be yelling at you and not me. I don't know. I thought they were yelling at me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1030.16s)]
*  I mean, let them yell at me. It's fine. Everything is not about America. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1034.64s)]
*  I got called a DMK agent. So let them like, it's fine. Anyway, I've been called. Yeah. Okay. So, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1037.52s)]
*  so it's not, you don't think it's America related. You think it's a, it's just like tuned up [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1044.16s)]
*  fundamentalists that did this. And India is striking without conspiracy theory of my own. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1048.8000000000002s)]
*  All right. Let's hear yours. So recently, this is, I don't know if there's any proven basis in this, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1057.92s)]
*  but very recently, there was, I mean, over like the past several years, there's been a push for a [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1065.04s)]
*  caste census in India. Right. And the reason that caste census is super important is that, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1070.48s)]
*  so like I mentioned earlier, the way Hindutva operates is that it basically relies on, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1077.04s)]
*  the Brahmins are like 5% of the population, something like that. Upper castes are maybe like 10 to 20% [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1082.56s)]
*  of the population, but they have all the fucking power. Right. You look at the media, you look at [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1090.08s)]
*  the judicial system. I think, I don't remember the statistics off the top of my head, but I think [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1095.4399999999998s)]
*  over the past three years, it was like 97% of high court appointees was like, they were, you see, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1101.2s)]
*  they were from the general category. Right. Something like that. I'm probably fudging the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1109.92s)]
*  numbers a little bit. Right. I'm a Hindu supremacist. Okay. Yeah. So basically, so the way Hindutva [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1114.4s)]
*  works is that it buries the reality that there's a disproportionate representation of upper castes [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  in both like the government, right. In power, the media, and basically all the main reigns of power [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1134.96s)]
*  that exist in India. Right. So that's the actual reality. Right. And if you, especially if you look [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1142.48s)]
*  under the British, right. And you look at the Madras presidency, Tamil Brahmins make up, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1148.72s)]
*  they made up 3% of the population, but they held, depending on the occupation, anywhere from 50 to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1155.2s)]
*  like 90% of the jobs. So it's always been a huge problem in India. And it's still a problem. Right. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1161.52s)]
*  Now, the thing is, the Hindutva wants to completely bury this. They want to completely bury this [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1170.48s)]
*  reality. Because their goal is to eradicate Muslims and Christians and non-like, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1178.4s)]
*  and communists as well. Those are the three groups of people, as Gowalkar or Sawarkar said, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1184.72s)]
*  that need to be eliminated. But in order for them to do that, they need to create this idea [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1189.76s)]
*  of a unified Hindu demographic. That never existed, by the way. Hinduism was never a unified [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1194.16s)]
*  religion. What happened was when the British came, a lot of their advisors were Brahmins. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1199.84s)]
*  And so the Brahmins basically told the British, hey, the books that we wrote, the Dharma Shastras [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1205.04s)]
*  and the Shastras, the Smithies and all of that, this is what's called Hindu law. Right. We're going [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1209.84s)]
*  to call this Hindu law. So in order to make the British administration of the subcontinent much [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1217.76s)]
*  easier, they basically lumped everyone that wasn't Muslim and that wasn't Christian as Hindus. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1222.32s)]
*  Right. And that also included Sikhs for a while. Right. Now, going back to this, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1228.0s)]
*  right. So Hinduism, sorry, Hindutva wants to basically unify these very disparate groups of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1234.64s)]
*  castes into one demographic called Hindus. And they want to weaponize this Hindu demographic [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1241.84s)]
*  against Muslims. Right. But this broad coalition of roughly a billion people [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1249.52s)]
*  relies on the majority of the population not understanding their caste position in society. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. There's an India Inc video that I want to pull up. Right. And these guys are, if you are [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1264.48s)]
*  learning about India politics, right. These are, this is a must watch. Like these guys are, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1271.04s)]
*  oh, let me pull this up. This is an absolute must watch. You have to watch this. This is your first [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  intro to the caste system. You actually have to watch this because this will give you how we got [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1284.72s)]
*  here in terms of like Hindutva. So this, so basically the long story short is that they [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  invent this idea of a Hindu majority. Not the Hindu nationalists per se, but these Brahmins [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1298.24s)]
*  that were the advisors of the British, they invent this idea of a Hindu majority. And the Hindutva [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1304.88s)]
*  crowd wants to basically weaponize this against Muslims. Now, the fatal flaw in that is if everyone [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1309.1200000000001s)]
*  realizes, if most of the people in India realize that they're being fucked over by the upper castes. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1316.8s)]
*  Right. That they're just being used by the upper castes. And one way of indicating that, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1322.72s)]
*  one way of collecting data and showing that to the broader population is through the caste [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1327.6s)]
*  census, is through collecting caste data through the Indian census. Right. Because that way, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1332.32s)]
*  people are able, the government collects how much land, how much power, or what the representation [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1337.76s)]
*  of government jobs each and every single broad category of caste actually has. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1345.12s)]
*  And the idea behind that is when the OBC's scheduled castes were the Dalits, the most [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1350.6399999999999s)]
*  oppressed castes and the Adivasis, once they find out that they're being constantly fucked over, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1357.4399999999998s)]
*  that they have zero representation, they have no land whatsoever, then they'll be against the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1363.84s)]
*  upper castes. So that's, so now Modi just recently released, they recently said, hey, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1368.8s)]
*  we're going to implement the caste census after a lot of political pressure. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1375.44s)]
*  Now, my conspiracy theory is that this is a diversion tactic. This is a diversion tactic [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1380.56s)]
*  from that. That's my conspiracy theory. So is using the terror attack as an opportunity. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1385.52s)]
*  Yes. Move the discourse away and unite India, not along. I mean, no cast just even Muslims alongside [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1390.72s)]
*  Hindus. Like we're one united India attacking a nation that has consistently done terror attacks [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1398.24s)]
*  inside of India and just that's the justification. Yeah. It's mind fucking. I know. Okay. Well, I'm, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  it's very late here. So I have one last question for you. Where do you see this going? Especially [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1414.48s)]
*  considering you might've gotten it the wrong last time in terms of like, it won't escalate that much. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxajIrtzpY&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
