*  So that we can set the conditions for a deal and president Trump's made it clear [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=205.44s)]
*  It's on the table. The question is whether Iran will take it be in this situation room pretty soon with the president [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=209.51999999999998s)]

*  It's true that for us Iran Iranian issue it's an issue with existential potential threat [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=872.78s)]

*  Gideon Levy once said Israel is the only occupier in the world that is convinced of its own [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1098.94s)]
*  ongoing victimhood. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1102.46s)]
*  And I think about that often. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1103.74s)]

*  It wasn't us. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1131.58s)]

*  Critics of the Jewish state would say you guys started this war by attacking Iran about [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1135.54s)]

*  As you mentioned earlier areas here and so far this team remains on standby but that [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1320.18s)]
*  doesn't mean that we are headed for any kind of de escalation here between Israel and Iran [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1325.42s)]
*  as both sides are continuing to maintain this very deadly. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1330.94s)]
*  OK the AP feed is bunk. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1335.94s)]
*  If this is from literally the last round of strikes we didn't see any of that shit. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1337.5800000000002s)]

*  This is literally Tel Aviv. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1344.18s)]

*  But from here I can tell you that that the feeling is certainly that this is not ending [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1353.7s)]
*  anytime soon that this could go on for weeks perhaps as the Israeli prime minister now [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1358.26s)]
*  talks about what he believes he has dealt in terms of a blow to Iran saying he believes [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1363.14s)]
*  he has set back Iran's nuclear program a very long time although he declined to allow [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1368.3s)]
*  it to elaborate. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1374.14s)]
*  But he did make clear that there are still additional targets for Israel to go after [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1375.14s)]
*  in Tehran and we are of course watching even in just the last few hours those airstrikes [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1378.7s)]
*  are indeed continuing. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1383.66s)]

*  All right Jeremy Diamond keep us updated on what you're seeing on the ground. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1387.74s)]
*  Obviously we've seen a lot of late breaking developments this evening. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1391.8600000000001s)]
*  Also CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward is joining us. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1394.94s)]
*  Clarissa and as you look at what's happening here you're at Tel Aviv's largest hospital [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1399.1000000000001s)]
*  where you just had to take shelter just to give everyone context for what it's been [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1403.86s)]
*  like on the ground. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1407.02s)]
*  Tell us what you've been seeing tonight. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1408.02s)]
*  Well it's been an unusual scene Caitlin as you just heard Jeremy articulate there for [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1412.6999999999998s)]
*  the past three evenings anytime you hear those sirens you know you have about 90 seconds [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1418.9799999999998s)]
*  to get to shelter and then very soon thereafter we have been used to hearing those barrages [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1423.82s)]
*  of Iranian missiles some of them intercepted some of them making landfall but on these [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1430.46s)]
*  last two occasions we haven't really heard much at all and on the last one the most recent [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1435.3400000000001s)]
*  one just about 45 minutes ago there wasn't the pre-alert it simply just started with [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1440.9s)]
*  the siren again usually you're given a pre-alert that gives you about 15 minutes to find a [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1447.22s)]
*  shelter so a sense that things are a little unusual tonight. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1452.66s)]
*  Doctors here are continuing to be prepared for any and all eventualities often these [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1458.54s)]
*  strikes have been happening in the very early hours in the morning so 430 in the morning [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1462.5s)]
*  it was last night when a series of strikes killed eight people particularly around the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1467.86s)]
*  Tel Aviv area and what the doctors have done Caitlin which is kind of extraordinary I haven't [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1474.22s)]
*  seen it before is to move this entire hospital some 600 patients they moved them into a parking [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1480.02s)]
*  lot that four days ago was full of motorcycles and cars and is now and they did it in the [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1487.42s)]
*  space of seven hours full of hundreds of patients who are down there 24 7 you know since this [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1493.9s)]
*  all started because they cannot be moved easily in the event of an emergency they have a whole [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1502.3000000000002s)]
*  operation center down there as well so that they can track which strikes are hitting in [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1507.78s)]
*  which hospitals it makes sense to bring so still bracing themselves potentially for what [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1514.7s)]
*  the rest of the night and the early morning may bring but so far relatively quiet here [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1521.14s)]
*  in Tel Aviv. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1527.22s)]
*  Yeah it just shows you the lengths that they're going to and also how quickly everything is [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1530.1000000000001s)]
*  going to be. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1534.78s)]
*  U.S. President Trump is weighing a critical decision in the four-day-old war between Israel [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1535.78s)]
*  and Iran whether to enter the fray by helping Israel destroy the deeply buried nuclear enrichment [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1537.8600000000001s)]
*  facility of Fordow which only American bunker busters dropped by American B-2 bombers can [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1541.42s)]
*  reach which is what we've been seeing all day that's all they've been entertaining or [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1545.8600000000001s)]
*  to force the truth. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1552.02s)]
*  But obviously the topic a main topic has changed given what's happening in the Middle East [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1553.8200000000002s)]
*  joining me now is Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Danny Janone and it's great [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1558.6200000000001s)]
*  to have you here sir because obviously the president coming out tonight and warning that [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1562.9s)]
*  everyone who lives in Tehran needs to evacuate immediately and then cutting this trip short [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1567.26s)]
*  has raised a lot of questions about what may have changed. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1571.66s)]
*  Do you know if there is anything changing on the ground? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1574.98s)]
*  Are there more strikes happening in Tehran tonight? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1578.94s)]
*  What is the latest that you've been briefed on? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1581.26s)]
*  Caitlin I can tell you what's happening from our side not from the U.S. side you know it's [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1584.1s)]
*  a U.S. decision what to do when to do how to do if they want to take action against [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1589.74s)]
*  Taiwan but from our side we continue with the strikes you know today we continue to [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1595.78s)]

*  the White House that the president did not think that was a good idea there was essentially [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1839.6200000000001s)]
*  a concern that it would escalate this conflict. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1844.26s)]
*  Does Israel see it that way that if you did take out the supreme leader that it would [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1846.18s)]
*  escalate this conflict more? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1849.38s)]

*  Today we have freedom to fly in many areas in Iran especially above Tehran so if we want to [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1868.74s)]
*  target someone we can do it but we will not get to the decision when and what and if to do it. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1875.6999999999998s)]
*  But the U.S. clearly has influence on that decision if Israel went to the United States [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1883.78s)]
*  the United States said they didn't think it was a good idea and Israel clearly listened. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1887.78s)]

*  and make it a part of greater Israel. Yes these are very simple solutions Caitlin very simple [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=822DzF3ruUk&t=1920.42s)]
