# Britain’s Humanitarian Mask Is A LIE | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s)
*  She's going, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what she's doing. I mean, that's what it is. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3.36s)]
*  She said, no politik here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=9.44s)]
*  No politik here! Hamas! Israel, number one! Hamas, number two! Hamas, not number one! [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=11.92s)]
*  Anyway, it's just like, it's nothing. It's pennies on the dollar, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=24.0s)]
*  but it's just yet another instance of like, classic government expenditure, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=28.4s)]
*  silly government expenditures. Anyway, all right, we're moving on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=33.92s)]
*  Totally and utterly inadequate. Starmer says the world cannot allow Gaza to starve. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=37.92s)]
*  We're going to talk about the international community's response, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=41.68s)]
*  the new community's response. I gotta pee though first. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=44.4s)]
*  With permission, the House, on the three recent trade deals, we've struck in the national interest. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=47.92s)]
*  But first, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to say something about the horrific situation in Gaza, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=53.36s)]
*  where the level of suffering, innocent children being bombed again, is utterly intolerable. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=61.36s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, we coordinated a response with our allies, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=69.12s)]
*  as set out in my statement with President Macron and Prime Minister Carney last night. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=74.24s)]
*  And I want to put on record today that we're horrified by the escalation from Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  We repeat our demand for a ceasefire as the only way to free the hostages. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  We repeat our opposition to settlements in the West Bank. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=92.08s)]
*  And we repeat our demand to massively scale up humanitarian assistance into Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=96.56s)]
*  The recent announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  a basic quantity is totally and utterly inadequate. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=108.0s)]
*  So we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=113.2s)]
*  We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=119.04s)]
*  And the Foreign Secretary will come to the House shortly to set out our response. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=121.92s)]
*  He's trying to deny the kids starvation allegations, bro. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=125.92s)]
*  He knows, he knows what his name is. He knows his name is kids starvation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=128.8s)]
*  He's like, nah, I don't like that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=132.72s)]
*  Nah, I don't like that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=135.2s)]
*  People keep calling me kid starver and I am not a child starver. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=137.76s)]
*  Please. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Meanwhile, they have contributed to the destruction in Gaza aggressively. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=144.16s)]
*  Here is Declassified UK breaking. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=149.28s)]
*  The Ministry of Defense has confirmed that to declassify the UK spy flights for Israel [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  will continue. RAF spy planes heading to Gaza have left the UK based on Cyprus [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  on five of the last six days, according to flight data. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=160.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Israel's partnership with the UK for security is crucial. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  The RAF support aids in protecting Israeli civilians from Hamas's relentless attacks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=166.16s)]
*  Oh brother. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  What's really interesting about all of this is that like they are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=171.2s)]
*  finally arriving at at least the optics front, which might even like they're, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=175.2s)]
*  they're becoming out of the on. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=180.88s)]
*  Okay. This is the position that they should have been day one. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=182.16s)]
*  They are doing, they're hitting the out of the one technique where they just start [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=187.04s)]
*  talking about Israel in a mean way and even aesthetically claim that they are going to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=192.08s)]
*  implement a blockade against Israel while simultaneously still offering all of the, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=196.88s)]
*  all of the military support necessary to Israel. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=202.08s)]
*  I asked the Foreign Secretary, what exactly are British air bases being used for during [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=204.96s)]
*  the genocide in Gaza? He refused to answer. Yeah. He went to, bro, kid starver went to Cyprus. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=208.32s)]
*  Okay. Kid starver directly went to Cyprus where there are British military bases that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=214.64s)]
*  conduct operations above Gaza at the behest of Israel in this security cooperation agreement [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=221.6s)]
*  that they have. It's bullshit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=228.16s)]
*  Tell us exactly what arms have been supplied to Israel over the past six months. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=230.08s)]
*  What arms are being supplied now to Israel? What RAF acrotery is being used for? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=235.36s)]
*  Is it supporting the Israeli war machine? And can he inform the house categorically [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=241.2s)]
*  that no component parts of an F-35 jet made in Britain is supplied to Israel to continue [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=246.4s)]
*  their bombardment of Gaza? There was also a previous court case where they directly supported [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=253.92s)]
*  the UK continuing to offer F-35 jet components to Israel. That literally just happened. Like, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=259.52s)]
*  that happened recently. No, wasn't there a court case where the UK court found that the United [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=267.12s)]
*  Kingdom was allowed to still send F-35 jet components to Israel? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=272.16s)]
*  Well, can I say to him with judgment that he asked me a similar question [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  a few weeks ago and I gave him the answer that we suspended arms sales. That was a sober decision [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  made. They're not being given use in Gaza at this time. That is a strict decision under our export [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=287.6s)]
*  licensing regime. Safe for the carve out we've made for F-35s, which I know he disagrees with, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=294.32s)]
*  but that is the position because we're not prepared to disrupt supply chains across the world. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=303.04s)]
*  Safe for the F-35 components. Minister of Health calling Zara Sultana so cheap for saying the UK [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=310.48s)]
*  should stop selling weapons to Israel. Between October and December 2024, the government approved [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=316.64s)]
*  over £127 million in export licenses to Israel, exceeding the combined total [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=322.16s)]
*  under the Tories for 2020 to 2023. You want to know something crazy? There's a comparison I'm [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=328.88000000000005s)]
*  going to make here as well to Israeli society or at least like some outspoken people in Israeli [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  society right now. These are the people, the Zara Sultanas and the Jeremy Corbyns of the world, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=341.36s)]
*  are the people that are desperately trying to preserve the soul of these countries. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=348.4s)]
*  A lot of these animals don't understand that. They are so invested in their completely distorted [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  worldview that revolves around might is right politics, where there is no right and no wrong. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=362.32s)]
*  The only thing that is correct is whatever we say goes that they don't understand that in the process [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  of scolding these people, they are once again dehumanizing themselves. These are the last people [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=374.56s)]
*  that are desperately trying to claw back some semblance of humanity for the Western world. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=381.76s)]
*  A humanity that we do not deserve to be associated with by the way. We are f-ing [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  barbaric animals and that's precisely what's going on in Israel as well. The reason why I make this [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=392.72s)]
*  comparison is because I saw another like idiotic Hasbara account. I think it was like Neo something. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=397.36s)]
*  Post these, the succession, these, these articles in a negative fashion, not realizing that these [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=403.44s)]
*  articles that she's posting negatively are unironically on the morally correct side. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=410.8s)]
*  But she doesn't realize that and I think actually she might have realized that and deleted it. Nope, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  here it is. Haaretz ladies and gentlemen, Neo Berg post, possibly the most famous Iranian, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=422.56s)]
*  Juwan X advocates for Iranian monarchy and restoration, Iranian monarchy restoration in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=428.8s)]
*  Israel anti-woke. Okay. She posted the succession, these, these article titles as a negative. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=434.72s)]
*  If you are a Jewish Israeli, you are complicit in the killing of 53,000 Palestinians from Ode [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  Biz Harat. Gideon Levy writes, stop calling it a Gaza war. Stop being a part of Netanyahu's [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=448.32000000000005s)]
*  genocidal legacy. Alon Idon, destroying Gaza with love. Israel's new Yogi Nazis. That last one is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=453.84s)]
*  about specifically the holistic yoga lovers in Israel that are, that are firmly committed to the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=461.28s)]
*  day. They are basically Neo Nazis that love their crunchy granola, Neo Nazis. Okay. Can you imagine [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=469.12s)]
*  posting this as a negative? Like how oblivious are you? How oblivious are you to the way the world [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=478.96s)]
*  views Israel that you literally post some of the only saving grace in Israeli society as a negative [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=488.08s)]
*  with the assumption that your audience is also going to respond to it like it's negative. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=497.28s)]
*  Here's Daniel Mate responding from Bad Hasbro, son of Gabor Mate, brother of Aaron Mate. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=502.32s)]
*  One of the last flashes of redemptive honesty in your society and you think it's contemptible. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=510.56s)]
*  You are going to go down in history as having chosen self-destruction over the kind of insight [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=515.68s)]
*  that changes things. This to me demonstrates how you are. Okay. This to me demonstrates how far gone [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=520.72s)]
*  you are in your world view, how invested you are in your world view where nothing, nothing at all [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=531.28s)]
*  can change your trajectory. But can you imagine looking at the last bastion, the last hope, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=538.64s)]
*  the last redeemers of Israeli society in any way, shape or form, looking at that and then turning [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=546.16s)]
*  around and being like, fuck these losers. They're a bunch of kapos, the kapo newspaper. Look, that's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  the first response. Insane. Insane. Golan, Israel becoming a pariah state, is killing children as a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=557.92s)]
*  hobby from the times of Israel. Yair Golan, the head of the opposition Democrats, issues a scathing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=568.16s)]
*  denunciation of the government of the war in Gaza saying that Israel is killing children in Gaza as [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  a hobby. There are at least liberal Zionists, okay, who fucking understand how bad this shit looks to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=578.4s)]
*  the Western world. So they're trying to massage the narrative to basically have something redeemable. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=586.0s)]
*  Now I don't put the other three article writers in the same degree here, okay? I need you to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=593.76s)]
*  understand something. This is very different than what I showed you. What I showed you earlier, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=601.84s)]
*  the thing that she was complaining about, these guys, they have a different mindset. They do [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=609.44s)]
*  actually have redeemable opinions, especially Gideon Levy. I might not agree with them the entire [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=616.48s)]
*  way, but it doesn't matter. They do have a, like at least clearly from what I read, what I saw bits [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=622.48s)]
*  and pieces of this article and what I know of Gideon's perspective, I'm not entirely familiar [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=630.16s)]
*  with Odeh Bizharad, but like the article title stands alone. Like those guys are, they're correct. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=635.12s)]
*  Yair Golan on the other hand is doing this as a mechanism of propaganda as well. Like he is [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  literally saying like, we've gone too far. You know what I mean? There is a number of baby murder [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=650.4s)]
*  that is appropriate. We've just gone above and beyond that. And now people fucking hate us. We've [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=656.32s)]
*  become a pariah state. We are becoming a pariah state, not realizing that you already are a pariah [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=662.32s)]

*  every baby in Gaza is an enemy. The enemy is not Hamas. We need to conquer Gaza and colonize it [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=731.76s)]

*  over and over again? That is the real debate happening in Israel. It is completely cooked [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=791.84s)]
*  as a society. Of course, it's a fucking pariah state. They've lost their goddamn minds. Israel [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=797.36s)]

*  to bring Israel here. Fuck. Yeah. Yesterday, Ofer Kassif tried to tell Dr. Abdullah Makat, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=825.92s)]

*  forbidden. He basically brings up the story of Dr. Abdullah Makat, who operated a public library [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=845.92s)]
*  in Gaza and was burned to death with his entire family. Let's take a look at the response. I don't [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=851.1999999999999s)]

*  I mean, I don't even think we need to translate. I could tell what she's saying. She just says, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=876.16s)]
*  why do you love Hamas? There's a bunch of Hebrew speakers in the chat. They say they can translate [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=890.56s)]

*  what it is. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=917.84s)]

*  Let me guess. Is he saying go to Gaza? I'll send you to Gaza. Something like that. He is accusing [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=947.84s)]
*  IDF soldiers with murder. If you can't hear it, leave. I won't let this her previous job was a [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=971.2s)]
*  Senagor for rapists and she was the worst victim accuser. She's a real devil. He accuses Israeli [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=977.1199999999999s)]
*  occupying four soldiers in murder. Yeah, he is doing that because he is doing that because that's [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=983.04s)]
*  the truth. These guys are so there. This goes to show this goes to show exactly how out of whack [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=990.2399999999999s)]
*  Israeli society and Israeli Knesset is where these guys are like, no, I don't even want to fucking [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=999.1199999999999s)]

*  someone who's innocent. Tell me he's a rapist Palestinian barbaric. No, of course, operative [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1010.48s)]

*  that's the modus operandi here. That's like the insanity that they're operating with. People are [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1025.68s)]
*  people are operating with the with the notion of Rabbi Shmueli like the the paranoid fantasies of [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1031.9199999999998s)]
*  Rabbi Shmueli basically. Okay. Here. Look, if you want to hear it, like if you want to hear what [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1040.32s)]
*  some other incredible takes are coming out of Israel, let's take a look. I'll tell you more than [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1048.1599999999999s)]
*  that. Every child, every baby in Gaza is an enemy. It's so funny to me, even though it's obviously [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1053.6s)]
*  gross and terrifying and and horrible. All of the worst things like if you if you feel like you hate [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  Israel, let me tell you, you don't hate Israel hard enough. Okay, there is no there is no amount [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1070.56s)]
*  of hatred that's that's hard enough. Okay, I will just say that. But on the other hand, there is [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1075.28s)]
*  something there's something really dark, but also ironic and somewhat funny about the fact that like [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1082.48s)]
*  in Israel, they openly are entertaining this stuff, right? And in America, when you say they're [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1089.68s)]
*  openly entertaining this stuff in Israel, you get branded a fucking anti-semite. It's so weird. It's [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1097.84s)]
*  like, but they're saying it like what do you mean? I'm just reporting on what they fucking said. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1104.24s)]
*  The fuck are you talking about? What are you with? Like what? No, in order to be a defender [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1110.32s)]
*  of Jewish people, you have to literally close your eyes and shut off your ears and bite your tongue [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1117.6s)]
*  and not say the truth about what the fuck is going on in Israel. They've lost their fucking minds. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1124.72s)]
*  Okay, a truly and utterly depraved society. Of course, of course, they have to be truly [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  and utterly depraved at this point. They're doing a fucking genocide for 19 months. You can't [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1137.6s)]
*  maintain a genocide for 19 months on an out group. Okay, without a healthy dose of dehumanization [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  propaganda that has to set in that has to be an incredibly important part of your identity. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1151.36s)]
*  That's it. Like, think about how much think about how much people freaked out about that one dude. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1157.6799999999998s)]
*  In Hamas on the I think it was like the Lebanese branch guy who was like, because of what Israel [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1167.6799999999998s)]
*  has done to us, a million October sevens is justified against Israel, right? He said that [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  shortly after October seven and everyone was like, this is genocide. This is genocidal. Okay, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1177.4399999999998s)]
*  there's been 19 months of genocide. And every single Israeli politician at this point, with [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1181.52s)]
*  the exception of like three, have literally been like, it's a genocide, and it's good. And we need [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1185.9199999999998s)]
*  to do genocide specifically to the fucking babies. But they keep saying it. What do you mean? If that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1190.1599999999999s)]
*  statement in and of itself you think is genocidal when the dude is fucking saying like, what Israel [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1195.2s)]
*  has done to us justifies a million October sevens, what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1200.0800000000002s)]
*  If you think that that is a genocidal statement, what the fuck do you think this is? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1203.52s)]
*  We need a new word for it. You can't just say this. Both of those things are are in the same [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1207.6000000000001s)]
*  fucking universe, you know? It's crazy. That's why I don't shy away. Like, previously, there are [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1213.28s)]
*  plenty of people in this community that would probably tell you that previously, like Jewish [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1220.32s)]
*  members of this community, especially would tell you that in the past, like two years ago, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1225.36s)]
*  or even like a couple months into what Israel was doing in Gaza, if I were to compare it to [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1230.48s)]
*  the Nazis, or if I were to compare what's happening in Gaza to the Holocaust, there would be a lot of [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1236.96s)]
*  people that would be like, oh, that's a bridge too far, I think. Now, you won't hear anybody fucking [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1241.52s)]
*  respond to that in a negative fashion. Everyone will say no, this is a, it's not a one to one [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1246.56s)]
*  comparison in terms of like the total numbers, but that is precisely what's going on. It is a [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1253.04s)]
*  mechanized death camp. It is mechanized death, just like the Holocaust was. And it's happening [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1259.9199999999998s)]
*  in an open air prison that has now turned into an open air death camp. Now think, why is it that the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1267.6s)]
*  public sentiment, the public sentiment has changed this dramatically? It's because people realize [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1273.68s)]
*  what's going on. And that's also part of the reason why. That is also part of the fucking reason why. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1279.04s)]
*  Look at this dipshit. Every child, every baby in Gaza is an enemy, he says. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1285.1200000000001s)]
*  That's the reason why the UK is at least trying to aesthetically present themselves in opposition [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1289.28s)]
*  to what Israel is doing, while still calling it a fucking war, by the way. The reason why, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1294.88s)]
*  the reason why, bro, it gets worse. Former Israeli minister of kinetic quotes, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1299.84s)]
*  Hitler while discussing the Gaza war. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1305.2s)]
*  As Hitler said, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1329.28s)]
*  I can't live if one Jew is left. We can't live here if one Islamo Nazi remains in Gaza. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  He has a whole segment on his Wikipedia dedicated to his Hitler statements. He has said something [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1364.24s)]
*  like this more than once. His Hitler comments are, I'm sorry, what? Fagelin has openly stated that [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1372.72s)]
*  though he is not opposed to peace, peace is not his goal and would not be on top of his agenda [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1379.52s)]
*  as prime minister. Rather, his focus on reforming Israel is an essentially Jewish state by acting on [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1384.8799999999999s)]
*  several campaigns on the religious, social and legal and security fronts. Yeah, he said that, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1390.0s)]
*  by the way, back in fucking, I guess he said it in when? June 16th, 2024. This is what I buy, dude, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm serious. I mean, like, look, people say, like, this is an edge case or whatever, right? Like, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1405.2s)]
*  this is an edge case. It's like chatter. It's not like what fucking Benjamin Netanyahu or a [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1408.88s)]
*  fucking security cabinet or the governing coalition are saying something that different. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1417.6000000000001s)]
*  They just don't like directly say Adolf Hitler said this and it's good, but they sound like Adolf [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1423.04s)]
*  Hitler. They repeat Adolf Hitler's arguments all the time. This guy is at least fucking honest [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1428.08s)]
*  about it. You know what I mean? He's directly giving credit to the man who originated the quote. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1433.52s)]
*  That's it. That's the only difference. So like the idea that these are like random edge cases [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1440.16s)]
*  is so fucking stupid. Okay. There is a link to Hitler comments of this guy. Oh my God. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1445.12s)]
*  In an article in higher ed, Yossi Sergius quoted Fagelin in context of demonstrations against the [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1453.68s)]

*  a neat and orderly pact of society and Germany received an exemplary regime, a proper justice [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1469.6s)]
*  system and public order. Hitler savored good music. He would paint. This was no bunch of thugs. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1474.0s)]
*  They merely used thugs and homosexuals. Fagelin clarified his position to the Marov newspaper [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1479.84s)]
*  that just because he considers Hitler a military genius, this does not mean he admires him. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1485.68s)]
*  He was banned from Britain. I mean, I guess at least he's honest. Like, I don't know. I mean, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1490.72s)]

*  crazy for him to also be like, yeah, and Hitler actually was fucking a figure worthy of admiration? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1506.08s)]
*  Like, is that that strange for him to say? Is it really, when you think about it, is it really [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1514.0s)]
*  that crazy for this guy to admire Adolf Hitler? Yeah, he's Jewish. Yeah, he's in Israel. Yeah, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1520.16s)]
*  his immediate family members most likely were fucking executed by Adolf Hitler in the Holocaust. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1526.3200000000002s)]

*  like after a steady dose of dehumanizing propaganda, where you dehumanize yourself, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1543.68s)]
*  it's understandable where he's just kind of looking at it and being like, fascism is fucking [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1549.3600000000001s)]

*  diverse body that is the Knesset in Israel. But to be fair, like I stated, oh, he's not anymore. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1558.3200000000002s)]
*  He almost was. Wait, I thought he was a part of Likud initially. Was he not a part of the, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1567.04s)]
*  the Knesset when he was in Likud? He was from Likud. I don't think he is any longer. He's a [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1572.56s)]
*  former minister of the Knesset, but he was in the Knesset. And now he's the head of the Zahud [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1578.8s)]

*  Yes. The libertarian party. I love the libertarian party being like as a libertarian, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1589.52s)]
*  Adolf Hitler is a, is a figure worthy of many, much admiration. Yeah. I saw in the Wikipedia, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1595.92s)]
*  it said he was a part of the Likud and the Knesset from 2013 to 2015 and then swapped over to the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1602.6399999999999s)]
*  libertarian party. Are people actually this knowingly fascist? Like they'd recognize how fascist [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1608.8s)]

*  lot. And now they're back. Of course. And better than ever. Oh, yeah. Israelis literally admit [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1684.88s)]
*  they're fascist. This happened not that long ago. New York Times interview with the West Bank [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1691.76s)]
*  cell. She proudly admits that she is a fascist. Like what are we talking about? Yes, I can admit [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1695.52s)]
*  that there's something fascist about what we're doing. There's something I can admit there's [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1702.08s)]
*  something fascist about me. I'm not hiding it. I don't believe there's any other way. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1708.8799999999999s)]

*  to fucking interview some of these goddamn settlers are fucking freaks. You misunderstood. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1731.12s)]
*  He was in disbelief. He's saying Israeli libs are Nazis in the closet. Yes, because Zionism is [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1735.12s)]
*  Nazism. Okay, Zionism, especially in this modern iteration of Zionism is impossible to contend with [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1739.84s)]
*  as anything but Nazi ideology. That's it. You can fantasize about a different kind of Zionism. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1749.04s)]
*  But like, if motherfucking Albert Einstein recognized that that version of Zionism did [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1755.6s)]
*  not exist in 1948, how the fuck are you 77 years later still fantasizing about it? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1762.08s)]
*  Like Albert Einstein was like, yeah, no, this is some fascist bullshit. We got to stop. Okay. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1768.8s)]
*  Either you have a perfectly peaceful binational commitment to fucking living alongside the [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1773.2s)]
*  indigenous population, or you're a fucking Nazi. And now when you say that in 2025, people go, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1778.96s)]
*  I can't believe you're saying that. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1786.48s)]
*  And I'm not saying that because like Albert Einstein is like brilliant or whatever the fuck. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1792.32s)]
*  Okay, I'm not I'm just showing I'm showing you that a guy who was there when Nazi Germany was [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1795.84s)]
*  happening very quickly as a Jewish man recognized what the fuck was going on in 19. It's like before [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1804.56s)]
*  1948. He was like, nope, this is done. We're done with this. This is crazy. Okay. I'm not saying [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1815.4399999999998s)]
*  Einstein is dumb either. I'm just saying that like, it doesn't it doesn't even require someone to be [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1820.8799999999999s)]
*  particularly fucking brilliant to be cognizant of what was taking what was taking place. He had [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1826.9599999999998s)]
*  fucking eyes and ears, dude. One of my family members said I should go to Israel to learn about [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1833.12s)]
*  it on the ground and said IDF isn't a terror organization. I said, well, Irgun and Lee, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1836.9599999999998s)]
*  he were Jewish terrorists, paramilitaries that created the state of Israel and got folded into [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1840.56s)]
*  IDF. And they said, I don't know what Irgun or Lee he are. How can you even have an opinion on [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1843.92s)]
*  Israel without knowing that? Dude, dude, you want to know why you that's the only way you can have [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1848.88s)]
*  an opinion on Israel, because that is the opinion of I suspect an American Jew, right? A person that [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1854.0s)]
*  may have like gone to Israel once or twice, a person that has probably gone to Israel once or [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1861.44s)]
*  twice that is just like utterly unknowledgeable about the fucking history of this nation state [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1866.88s)]
*  that they want to defend. Because the best possible way for a Westerner who's far removed [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1871.52s)]
*  from living in Israeli society to defend Israel is for a with a healthy diet of propaganda and [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1875.92s)]
*  certainly a lot of lack of knowledge. If you don't have those gaps in your knowledge of the history [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1883.44s)]
*  of Israel, you are going to have a very hard time with the with the contradictions that unfold in [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1889.68s)]
*  front of your eyes. This is the reality. This is why so many people who do learn about the true [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1896.24s)]
*  history of Israel go okay, fuck this. I'm out. It's easy, especially for an American Jew or a [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1900.88s)]
*  Westerner to fucking say that because you don't have that same association. You didn't grow up [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1907.2800000000002s)]
*  there. Why the fuck would you care? Yeah, you're like, okay, that's just some psychotic shit [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1912.64s)]
*  happening over there. That's nothing to do with me. What the fuck? I don't give a fuck. Anyway, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1918.0s)]
*  truly just a fucking repulsive Nazi society at this point. And they are as I showed you yesterday, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1922.0s)]
*  like a Benny, not Benny Gantz, sorry, Benny Gantz, I have a smoke for separately. He also [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1929.44s)]

*  Gazan and the world has yet to stop us. That's what he said. Okay, he said that. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1950.24s)]
*  I just googled Einstein on Zionism and it says he was positive about it. Are these lies? Einstein [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1964.8s)]
*  very openly declared the version of Zionism that every Jewish person, especially Jews that were [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1971.1999999999998s)]

*  Zionism initially. Okay, Einstein also was one of those Jews. Of course, ironically enough, I told [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=1990.8799999999999s)]
*  about this on my Oxford speech, which I'm going to get to in a second. They thought, oh great, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2000.08s)]
*  we will have a land without people for a people without land. The Jews in that situation were the [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2005.84s)]
*  people without land. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2010.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, this is modern Zionism. Okay. If you want to understand modern Zionism anyway, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2030.56s)]
*  the European union has officially agreed to review his trade agreement with Israel due to the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2037.1999999999998s)]
*  worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza. They're not, they don't think it's enough that they're [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2040.48s)]
*  allowing like one or two fucking trucks to enter into the Gaza strip. And they are finally deciding [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2046.3999999999999s)]
*  to posture aesthetically against finally starting to posture aesthetically against the events that [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2053.36s)]
*  are unfolding against the genocide without calling it a genocide. This is the first step. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2059.92s)]
*  It might be far too late at this point. I welcome any step in the in the correct direction, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2066.08s)]
*  but 19 fucking months, dude. Jesus Christ. We are now entering a dark new phase in this conflict. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2072.56s)]
*  Netanyahu's government is planning to drive Gazans from their homes into a corner of the strip to [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2080.96s)]
*  the south and permit them a fraction of the aid that they need. Yesterday, minister Smodrick [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2088.08s)]
*  even spoke of Israeli forces cleansing Gaza, destroying what's left of residents, Palestinians [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2098.0s)]
*  being relocated, he said to third countries. We must call this what it is. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  It is extremism. It is dangerous. It is respellant. It is monstrous. And I condemn it [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2117.36s)]
*  in the strongest possible terms. There is a UN plan ready to deliver aid at scale needed with [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2124.2400000000002s)]
*  mitigations against a diversion. There are brave humanitarians ready to do their jobs. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  There are over 9,000 trucks at the border. Prime Minister Netanyahu, end this blockade now [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2142.1600000000003s)]
*  and let the aid in. Regrettably, Madam Deputy Speaker, despite our efforts, this Israeli [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2152.96s)]
*  government's egregious actions and rhetoric have continued. They are isolating Israel from its [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2160.0800000000004s)]
*  friends and partners around the world, undermining the interests of the Israeli people, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2166.8s)]
*  and damaging the image of the state of Israel in the eyes of the world. I find this deeply painful [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2172.0800000000004s)]
*  as a lifelong friend of Israel and a believer in the values that were expressed in its declaration [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2178.4s)]
*  of independence. As the prime minister and fellow leaders said yesterday, we cannot stand by [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2185.04s)]
*  in the face of this new- No more lifelong friends of Israel, bitch. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2191.84s)]
*  It is incompatible with the principles that underpin our bilateral relationship, rejected [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2195.36s)]
*  by members across this House, and frankly, it's an affront to the values of the British people. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2202.48s)]
*  Therefore, today, I'm announcing that we have suspended negotiations with this Israeli government [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2210.48s)]
*  on a new trade, free trade agreement. The situation in Gaza is catastrophic. The aid [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2216.48s)]
*  that Israel has allowed in is, of course, welcomed, but it's a drop in the ocean. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2223.68s)]
*  Aid must flow immediately without obstruction and at scale because this is what is needed. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2230.64s)]
*  By the way, this is exactly what happened with South Africa. The West was fully on board with [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  apartheid until it was a political burden. Now, most people think the West was always anti-apartheid. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2242.2400000000002s)]
*  Apartheid probably would have ended earlier if it were not for the US and UK. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2246.16s)]
*  Yep. Does Israel have to let in humanitarian aid to Gaza? Survey. Israeli Channel 13 News, 53%. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2250.16s)]
*  No! 34%. Yes. 13% don't know. This, by the way, is a survey conducted on the Israeli Jewish society [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2257.68s)]
*  and Israeli Palestinian citizens of Israel as well. Their designation, not mine. So when those [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2273.12s)]
*  numbers are 53%, no, I would love to see what the demographic breakdown of that is. For the record, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2280.56s)]
*  Moin Rabbani, as he points to, this is all symbolic. After 19 months of genocide, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2287.6s)]
*  Great Britain has decided it needs to send an unambiguous message to Israel. The accelerated [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2291.92s)]
*  delivery of weapons from Britain to Israel, initiated by the Stammer government, to enable [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2295.6s)]
*  the intensified mass slaughter of Palestinians will continue without interruption. So will the [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2300.72s)]
*  import of illegal products from illegal settlements that sustains the illegal Israeli occupation. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2303.9199999999996s)]
*  But London will pause negotiations with the genocidal apartheid state about a UK-Israel [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2307.68s)]
*  free trade agreement. The Stammer government will continue giving Israel everything it needs to [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2311.4399999999996s)]
*  continue with the genocide of apartheid, but make a performative gesture of punishing Israel by [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2315.2799999999997s)]
*  withholding from it something that has not been provided. The unambiguous message, keep up the [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2319.12s)]
*  fantastic work. We've got your back. Too clever by half. Pure smoke and mirrors. The reason why [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2324.0s)]
*  they're even issuing the statement in and of itself is important though, because the reason [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2329.6s)]
*  why they're issuing the statement implies that they want to, at least on the propaganda front, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2334.3199999999997s)]
*  sever ties with the seemingly unconditional support that they've offered Israel. It's a step in the [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2339.44s)]
*  right direction. It's a step in the right direction. They're trying to save face, but the very fact [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2346.56s)]
*  that they recognize that there is face saving that must be done implies that more good things [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2352.08s)]
*  could happen in the future. That's all I'm saying. I'm just explaining to you that obviously this is [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2358.16s)]
*  not going to be a real game changer in the short term. It's not going to be possibly a game changer [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2364.96s)]
*  in the long term, but it is somewhat positive because it moves the needle in the appropriate [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2370.8799999999997s)]
*  direction. Toxic repulsive pariah state in the eyes of the politicians is a little different [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2376.48s)]
*  than Israel becoming a toxic repulsive pariah state in the eyes of the public. Because at the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2384.32s)]
*  end of the day, given that we do not have a real democratic process in the Western world, it is just [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2388.88s)]
*  a sham, a mockery as we have found out as it's in full display that sham is in full display with the [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2395.36s)]
*  direct difference in opinion from the broader public on this issue versus our politicians on [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2404.0800000000004s)]
*  this issue. The very fact that the politicians are playing catch up here, even if it's for [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2411.12s)]
*  aesthetic reasons implies that more reckoning could come down the line. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2415.52s)]
*  I've made these points also with my talks with Israelis. Also, I've had talks with UN and the [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2424.72s)]
*  regional leaders as well. Pressure is necessary to change the situation. It is clear from today's [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2432.08s)]
*  discussion that there is a strong majority in favor of review of article two of our association [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2440.72s)]
*  agreement with Israel. So we will launch this exercise and in the meantime it is up to Israel [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2447.04s)]
*  to unblock the humanitarian aid. Saving lives must be our top priority. Israel's prime minister has [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2454.3999999999996s)]
*  condemned the leaders of France, Britain and Canada after they called for an end to his country's [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2462.3999999999996s)]
*  renewed military offensive in Gaza. Benjamin Netanyahu called their remarks a huge prize for [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2467.52s)]
*  Hamas and insisted Israel would continue to press for what he described as a total victory over [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2473.36s)]
*  Hamas. Well, the joint statement signed by Sikir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney says, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2479.04s)]
*  dog, don't make Hamas look good. Simple solution. You know what I mean? You made your bed. You know [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2485.68s)]
*  what I mean? You made this fucking bed, big dog. What are we talking about? Oh, wow. This is Hamas. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2490.8s)]
*  You're you're playing into the hands of Hamas. This is why I said like as the the depravity, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2496.96s)]
*  as the depravity of Israel becomes impossible to defend. And by my estimation, it was impossible [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2503.76s)]
*  to defend like 10 days in obviously, but it becomes even impossible for politicians to defend it. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2511.84s)]
*  It. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2518.08s)]
*  More and more people will also more and more people will also come to the conclusion that perhaps [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2523.04s)]
*  resisting against this atrocious terrorist state is not the worst fucking thing. Obviously, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2528.64s)]
*  there's a healthy dose of Islamophobia associated with this. So I'm not I'm not expecting like [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2535.6s)]
*  Americans to fucking praise Hamas anytime soon. OK, but Israel itself has made Israel itself has [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2541.36s)]
*  made Hamas the the actual responsible party here, the actual party that is reasonable in comparison [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2551.2799999999997s)]
*  to Israel, because genocide is unreasonable, no matter who's doing it. It's that simple. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2559.68s)]
*  While they have always supported Israel's right to defend Israelis against terrorism, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2564.72s)]
*  the current escalation is wholly disproportionate. And it warns if Israel does not cease the renewed [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2569.52s)]
*  military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2576.08s)]
*  actions in response. Israel eased its complete blockade of the territory on Monday and let in [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2581.36s)]
*  a handful of aid trucks. But the UN says far more supplies are needed. The bombardment of Gaza has [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2587.52s)]
*  continued overnight with reports of deadly airstrikes. This comes not long after the UN's [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2593.36s)]
*  humanitarian chief has called the first delivery of aid into Gaza for 11 weeks a drop in the ocean. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2598.4s)]
*  We'll speak to our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams, in a moment. But first, let's hear [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2605.44s)]
*  from Yuland Nel in Jerusalem. Yuland, first, those comments then from the UK, Canada and France [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2610.0s)]
*  and the reaction from Israel. Talk us through what's been happening. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2617.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, we've had the Israeli Prime Minister condemning that joint statement, saying it's a huge [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2621.12s)]
*  prize for Hamas and that it will invite further atrocities of the kind that was perpetrated on [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2627.68s)]
*  the 7th of October 2023, the deadly attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2634.48s)]
*  He also said that Israel would continue to defend itself by just means until total victory. But I [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2641.8399999999997s)]
*  think this won't be so easily brushed off by the Israeli leader because these are important [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2648.88s)]
*  UK, France and Canada that have come out with this very harshly worded statement, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2653.92s)]
*  really some of the strongest criticism that we've seen so far of Israel's handling of the war [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2659.92s)]
*  and threatening concrete actions as well without going into what those might be. Now, this all [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2666.08s)]
*  happening as we continue to see Israel's deadly bombardment, this intense military offensive going [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2672.8s)]
*  on in the Gaza Strip overnight. I feel like these people are literally robots, dude. That is crazy. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2678.4s)]
*  They are robots. Like, immediately, right after the official government statement is [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2689.6000000000004s)]
*  against Israel, they drop the fucking passive voice, like overnight. What happened? Like, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2698.56s)]
*  do you not have any humanity? I don't understand how they can just like yesterday, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2706.64s)]
*  say Israel has a right to defend itself. And then tomorrow, as soon as the government offers [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2712.72s)]
*  permission, just like you didn't spend the last 19 months of genocide, constantly fucking broadcast [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2718.8s)]
*  the most defensible position for Israel, as though you didn't do that at all. You just turn around and [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2725.6s)]
*  go, Israel has been doing incredible bombing campaigns in Gaza. That is crazy. That is fucking [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2733.7599999999998s)]
*  insane. Actually crazy. This shows me, this goes to show how important words are, how important using [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2739.7599999999998s)]
*  certain terms are. Because if Keir Starmer, the kid starver was calling it a fucking genocide, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2746.72s)]
*  the BBC would too. Straight up. The Hamas-run civil defense is saying that at least 44 people [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2752.56s)]
*  have been killed, most of those within the space of about half an hour, we understand from local [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2760.16s)]
*  sources, when there were Israeli strikes that hit a school, being used as a shelter for displaced [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2765.2799999999997s)]
*  people in Gaza City. In the southern part of the Gaza Strip, there was a fuel station that's [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2770.88s)]
*  disused, being used as a tent city for displaced people that was hit, a residential building of [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2778.16s)]
*  three stories as well. And, you know, still we're waiting to see what aid goes into Gaza in the [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2784.3199999999997s)]
*  course of the day. Lots of safety and logistical issues given the ongoing Israeli military offensive. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2791.6s)]
*  But now that Israel has eased this blockade, it's been a total blockade of the Gaza Strip for 11 [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2798.56s)]
*  weeks now, with no food, no medicines, no fuel, no shelters going into Gaza. There's really a dire [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2805.04s)]
*  humanitarian situation. And we've heard that only nine lorryloads of aid were cleared for entry into [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2811.52s)]
*  Gaza one day ago. A senior UN official has told the BBC this morning that there are this clearance [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2818.16s)]
*  that's been given for 100 or so lorryloads, but of course this is being seen as a drop in the ocean [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2826.0s)]
*  given the huge needs of a population of two million people. Yuland, for the moment, thank you [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2831.52s)]
*  very much. Yuland, now in Jerusalem. As we said, we'll speak to Paul Adams in just a moment, but [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2837.52s)]
*  Yuland was referring there to the aid situation in Gaza. Well, the UN's humanitarian relief chief, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2842.64s)]
*  Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat, has been speaking to the BBC in the last hour, saying just [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2847.7599999999998s)]
*  five aid trucks were cleared to enter after Israel's blockade was lifted, but are stuck on the border. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2852.88s)]
*  That's a drop in the ocean. And let's be clear, those five trucks are just sat on the other side [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2859.04s)]
*  of the border right now. They've not reached the communities they need. Bro, this has been ongoing. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2862.96s)]
*  That's interesting. Perhaps some people will ask, wait a minute, did this happen overnight? I'm [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2868.48s)]
*  confused because it sure feels like it happened overnight. The way you changed up, the way you [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2874.96s)]
*  changed your tone, not Tom Fletcher, I'm just saying, like the way the BBC is crazy. Like is [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2881.44s)]
*  this, it must've happened just last night, right? Cause, cause otherwise why would the BBC not cover [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2888.08s)]
*  all of the preceding events, all of the preceding events that, that must've been quite similar [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2894.7999999999997s)]
*  to this starvation campaign. Interesting. I'm not, I'm not, this is not about Tom Fletcher chat. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2900.72s)]
*  The reason why I'm saying this is because I still value the permission structure that opens up when [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2907.2s)]
*  brave people tell the fucking truth. People in positions of power demonstrating bravery is still [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2917.36s)]
*  important. This is why, because the impact of this, the impact of this is your nan, your da [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2923.36s)]
*  watching fucking this coverage and, and becoming more radical and in their understanding [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2933.28s)]
*  of the situation. If that wasn't important, Israel wouldn't spend a fuck ton of money [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2941.84s)]
*  and, and advocacy groups that they've designed specifically to stop people from learning the [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2948.2400000000002s)]
*  truth and saying the truth to, to make it impossible for people without any punishments whatsoever [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2954.1600000000003s)]
*  to say Israel's doing a fucking genocide. Okay. That kind of permission matters because once [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2962.1600000000003s)]
*  politicians say it, then the media feels the media feels less fearful about covering it truthfully. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2968.4s)]
*  And then when the media covers it more truthfully, the numbers that are on the side of the Palestinian [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2975.92s)]
*  population grows. People no longer feel a sense of fear in supporting Israel. Oh, in supporting [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2982.32s)]
*  Israel. They never felt a sense of fear in supporting Palestine to reach. And, you know, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2987.92s)]
*  let me describe what is on those trucks. This is baby food, baby nutrition. There are 14,000 [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2992.56s)]
*  babies that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them. This is not food that Hamas [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=2998.16s)]
*  are going to steal. Now we run the risk of looting. We run the risks of being hit as part of the [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3003.8399999999997s)]
*  Israeli military offensive. We run all sorts of risks trying to get that baby food through [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3011.12s)]
*  to those mothers who cannot feed their children right now because they're malnourished. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3016.0s)]
*  Tom Fletcher, well, let's speak to our diplomatic correspondent, Paul, from these three allies of [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3020.7999999999997s)]
*  Israel. Paul, I mean, how significant are they? It feels pretty significant. I mean, that some [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3026.88s)]
*  of that language that was used in the statement issued last night was almost unprecedented. You [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3032.96s)]
*  know, the level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable, they said. They described the Hamas [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3038.08s)]
*  attacks of October the 7th as heinous and said that Israel had the right to respond. But they [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3043.76s)]
*  of course, they described the escalation as, in their words, wholly disproportionate. And the [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3048.7200000000003s)]
*  fact that the long statement included a warning towards the end of further concrete steps [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3053.76s)]
*  certainly will have the Israelis wondering. Yeah, you got to do your 10m Israel highs before you [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3060.2400000000002s)]
*  ever dare criticize the beautiful state. How can I talk to someone that wants to support Palestine [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3066.0s)]
*  but does not support Hamas? I mean, the question is simple. First of all, you don't have to support [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3070.2400000000002s)]
*  Hamas. Like, what the fuck do you mean support Hamas? You're an American or you're in London, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3074.88s)]
*  in England, like, we are not capable of supporting Hamas. Okay, it's not a real thing. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3080.96s)]
*  But in terms of like, like, talking to people that are like, well, I like Palestinians, but I don't [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3088.08s)]
*  like Hamas or whatever. The easiest question is, what the fuck would you do? What would you do? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3096.2400000000002s)]
*  What would you do if your family is being murdered by this invisible force that's bombing your fucking [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3103.36s)]
*  home? What would you do? And it's not a stretch to say it's not a stretch to say that like, of [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3108.56s)]
*  course you would rise up and fucking arms against that. It's a reality that Israeli politicians [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3114.56s)]
*  have also recognized members of the Shin Bet like leaders of Shin Bet have openly stated, as has [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3120.32s)]
*  as a former prime ministers have stated that if they were on the other side of that fucking border [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3128.64s)]
*  fence, they would join Hamas or whatever terrorist group existed at the time that Israel considers to [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3134.16s)]
*  be a terrorist group. That's it. The entire notion of like, these guys are scary brown terrorists, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3139.52s)]
*  like we have to fucking remember October 7 all day every day is fucking ridiculous. Look at what [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3144.48s)]
*  Israel's doing, dude. Get the fuck out of here with October 7, October 7, October 7 Hamas, Hamas, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3148.64s)]
*  Hamas, Hamas. The average person fancies themselves to be like a radical individual who wants to [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3153.04s)]
*  engage in self-defense when their fucking taco order is busted, when they get a shitty taco order. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3159.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're talking about like genocide and actually recognizing that a genocide is happening, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3166.48s)]
*  but then you're not supposed to do anything about it. Like, what are we talking about? What the fuck [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3173.12s)]
*  does this? This doesn't make any sense. You don't have to fucking ride or die for Hamas. It doesn't [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3176.4s)]
*  matter. There is nothing you can do in terms of like defending Hamas or supporting Hamas anyway. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3181.04s)]
*  It's literally fucking illegal in most parts of the world and even in America [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3186.24s)]
*  where it is legal, you can legally say you support Hamas. They're still trying to make it illegal. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3192.08s)]
*  Okay. Just literally say, who do you think is the more responsible party? Do you think it's Hamas [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3198.56s)]
*  or do you think it's the fucking settler colonial state that is doing death and destruction to all [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3204.4s)]
*  Palestinians? Whether some of Israel's closest allies are now beginning to think about things [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3209.2s)]
*  like recognize. Okay, but ignoring October 7 is just stupid. You are erasing a tragedy that [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3216.48s)]
*  killed children. Yeah, so did the Nat Turner rebellion. How much do you talk about how fucked [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3223.68s)]
*  up that was when covering the horrifying crime of chattel slavery? October 7 was a tragic event. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3229.52s)]
*  Okay. I've said already by my estimation, no one else's by my estimation when you target civilians, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3238.48s)]
*  that is appropriate to consider an act of terror. Okay. Having said that, what I'm not saying it's [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3247.2s)]
*  perfect, but ignoring it is just as crazy. What do you mean? I've never no dumb ass. I've never [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3254.0s)]
*  ignored October 7. I'm saying that October 7 is virtually nothing in comparison to what Israel has [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3259.6s)]
*  done. Israel has done a million October 7s. What are you talking about? Israel has done an October [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3266.4s)]
*  7 basically every two days for the past 19 months. This is not ignoring October 7. I'm saying you [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3272.56s)]
*  sound like a fucking moron if you keep talking about October 7 right now. Even before October 7, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3279.52s)]
*  Israel has done an October 7 to Palestinians once every couple fucking years. How do you think [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3285.76s)]
*  October 7 happened? Yeah, when I'm dismissive of motherfuckers bringing up October 7 right now, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3291.92s)]
*  you're doing that to defend genocide. I don't give a fuck. Fuck you. Okay. That's it. For me, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3296.56s)]
*  if you're bringing up October 7 at this point, you're a fucking freak. Like you're a psycho. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3302.64s)]
*  Straight up. You're just basically telling me that you don't think, you only think Israelis are human [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3307.92s)]
*  and you don't think Palestinians are. It's that simple. Because there's no way you have the same [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3313.2s)]
*  fucking metric, dude. There's no way. There is no way you have the same metric for pain and violence. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3318.24s)]
*  It's both sides in the Holocaust. Literally standing terroristas. Yes, people that fucking [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3324.8s)]
*  bring up October 7 at this point are de facto standing terroristas as in the terrorist state [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3330.5600000000004s)]
*  of Israel. Okay. Yeah, it's like mentioning 9-11 in comparison to millions of people killed in the [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3336.32s)]
*  Middle East. Fucking ridiculous. What is this? I can't, the link is busted. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3341.6000000000004s)]
*  ... recognizing the state of Palestine, something that the French have indicated they might do at [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3350.4s)]
*  a conference in New York next month. Possibly, Britain has already had a partial suspension of [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3354.72s)]
*  licenses since late last year. Possibly revisiting the kind of trade deals that countries have with [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3363.52s)]
*  Israel. There are many, many measures that would be available if countries decided that a red line [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3370.88s)]
*  has finally been crossed and that it is time not just to issue harsh words of condemnation, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3378.24s)]
*  but to actually show Israel through action that enough is enough. Paul, there's already [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3384.24s)]
*  an international criminal court warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu. So he politically, surely, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3392.3999999999996s)]
*  is having to weigh up his options very carefully considering the makeup of his government. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3399.52s)]
*  Yes. I mean, look, that's been a reality now since, what, the middle of last year. He knows [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3404.08s)]
*  perfectly well that there are countries, including Britain, where he cannot safely travel without [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3411.6s)]
*  the possibility, a theoretical possibility perhaps, but a possibility nonetheless of being [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3416.64s)]
*  arrested. I think the point that some of Israel's, actually some former Israeli leaders, including [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3423.92s)]
*  Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister, make is that this prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3432.96s)]
*  has led Israel into territory that the country has simply never been in before. And that territory [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3437.36s)]
*  is that of an international pariah. And what you see in the comments over the last few days, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3444.0s)]
*  and particularly that statement last night, is the very real aspect of Israel plunging further and [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3450.6400000000003s)]
*  further into that kind of territory, which if you consider the level of horror and outrage [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3458.0s)]
*  and international goodwill towards Israel that accompanied the attacks by Hamas on October the [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3465.52s)]
*  7th, is an astonishing reality. These people are so gross, dude. Oh, we must acknowledge the [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3471.12s)]
*  atrocities. Acknowledge that it is a genocide and advocate to invade Tel Aviv right now with the [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3482.8s)]
*  coalition of the willing. That's what must be done. You either fucking stop Israel dead in his [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3488.88s)]
*  track through the diplomatic options readily available, and if they refuse, you invade Tel Aviv. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3495.28s)]
*  That's it. That's it. There's no other way at this point. I'm sorry. There is no other fucking way. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3500.88s)]
*  A coalition of the willing, if the diplomatic option is not there, if Israel does not respond [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3507.04s)]
*  to the diplomatic option, then you have to have a coalition of the willing get together and stop [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3513.28s)]
*  Israel militarily through a military invasion. The fuck? What is this appeasement shit? What do [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3518.64s)]
*  we have to do? Wait for them to invade Turkey or something? Like what? What is it? Because the [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3524.32s)]
*  reality of the matter is, despite British surveillance and despite like suspicions that [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3528.56s)]
*  the concentration camps were actually death camps, the Holocaust wasn't fucking live streamed in [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3533.04s)]
*  broad daylight. Okay. This is precisely the reason why the allied forces only got into the battle [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3537.92s)]
*  to fight against Nazi Germany because they were acquiring territory. Okay. It was not like a lot [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3546.64s)]
*  of people, obviously and understandably think about the Holocaust as the most insane thing that took [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3554.0s)]
*  place, the most violent thing that took place because it's true. That is the most violent thing [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3561.36s)]
*  that took place during World War II. Having said that, having said that, people didn't fucking know [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3565.2000000000003s)]
*  that it was going on or at least had no scope of understanding of what was taking place at the time. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3570.96s)]
*  They only fucking went to war because Germany was belligerent and was fucking invading every [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3578.2400000000002s)]
*  other goddamn country. That's the reason why the Western force actually fucking invaded. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3582.48s)]
*  Now we know what is going on. We see it. It's like having a fucking, having a live stream camera [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3592.32s)]
*  inside of basically every day babies that are fucking decapitated. Every day there is another [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3597.6s)]
*  toddler whose head has been blown off by a fucking missile. How do you look at that and say we have [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3603.92s)]
*  to put a, like we can't put an end to this. October 7, October 7, October 7. What the fuck do you mean [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3610.2400000000002s)]
*  October 7? Jesus Christ. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3615.52s)]
*  Oh my God. This person is so fucking gross. I'm glad you actually clapped this dumb fuck. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3634.24s)]
*  Lovely official. Fucking, you know, follow your leader. Okay. Follow your leader. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3639.84s)]
*  Aye yi yi. We're talking about the fucking atrocities that are unfolding. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3645.6800000000003s)]
*  And this dumb fuck posts an Israeli Hasbara account with dead bodies on it to be like Hamas [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3652.7200000000003s)]
*  sniped people, steal Hamas sniped people. Like look, Hamas is actually killing its own people [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3658.88s)]
*  for taking flour aid from trucks to make bread. Follow your fucking leader, bitch. You are a Nazi. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3665.6s)]
*  Okay. And your end will come. Your end will come just like every other fucking Nazi's end came. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3672.56s)]
*  Okay. Remember that. Have that fear in the back of your mind every single fucking day of your [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3678.56s)]
*  existence going on from, from this point onward. Remember that one day you will find yourself in [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3684.24s)]
*  that fucking bunker. Okay. Disgusting filth. The NASA hospital is the largest in the city. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3690.64s)]
*  It is also one of the only hospitals still functioning. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3698.56s)]
*  A team of British doctors and surgeons is now working there. They are specialists in plastic [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3702.72s)]
*  surgery. Delusional. You flipping out going to make this worse and worse. Lema fail, but you [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3708.16s)]
*  are freaking out. What are you saying? 55 month subscriber. What the fuck are you saying, bro? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3713.52s)]
*  Rip? What do you mean rip? I don't understand. I don't even understand the point you're trying [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3719.44s)]
*  to make. You're saying my anger at a time when the rest of the world is at least aware enough [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3723.28s)]
*  to admit that Israel is doing some fuck shit. My anger is going to make Israel do a harder genocide. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3732.64s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? Israel is getting their notes on its exterminationist policies from [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3739.04s)]
*  a fucking Twitch streamer. Please clarify your position. Yeah. The angrier one gets over Israel [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3744.8s)]
*  doing a genocide, the more Israel has to do genocide. You're making it worse. You really [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3752.96s)]
*  don't believe you're pushing so much people away from the masses? Convince the masses. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3757.76s)]
*  If there was a democratic process, the masses would have already decided long ago for Israel [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3763.04s)]
*  to stop this death and destruction. There is no democratic process here. That is precisely the [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3768.88s)]
*  reason why after 19 months of genocide, there are at least like government officials that are [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3774.32s)]
*  finally saying enough is enough. It's not the fucking masses that I must convince. It's the [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3779.28s)]
*  notion of democracy itself that you need to drop. What the fuck 55 month subscriber being like, wow, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3785.6000000000004s)]
*  I can't believe how uncivil you are. You have given me five fucking dollars or six dollars [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3793.28s)]
*  for 55 months following since March 6th in 2019. That means you heard me say America [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3799.12s)]
*  deserved 9 11. That means you were there when I got banned for saying for calling a chatter, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3804.8s)]
*  a cracker bitch. That means you were through, you were through thick and thin. You watched me [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3811.04s)]
*  day in, day out. What the fuck are you talking about? Your expectation is that I remain civil [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3817.04s)]
*  in the face of a live streamed baby Holocaust. Are you fucking stupid? What happened? Hey man, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3824.32s)]
*  you're the one freaking out, not me. Yes, you are a fucking worm like individual. If you don't [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3832.7200000000003s)]
*  actually freak out at the sight of dead children every fucking day, that's my point. You didn't [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3839.44s)]
*  learn a single damn thing. What the fuck? That is crazy. Also, there is nothing in here. This is [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3845.92s)]
*  such a cowardly way to try and criticize me. Like there is no, there is no like your statement is [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3853.6s)]
*  something that I disagree with. It's just simply assuming that people will hear what I'm saying [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3861.2799999999997s)]
*  and actually continue to fucking defend Israel's genocide. Is that what you mean? The rest of the [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3866.7999999999997s)]
*  global south was already on that fuck Israel tip in perpetuity. Now the Western world, especially [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3872.96s)]
*  younger generations of the Western world have arrived at that justifiable conclusion. Okay. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3881.28s)]
*  Wake the fuck up. Wake up. Smell the fucking roses. Or maybe you got stroked out like John [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3888.0800000000004s)]
*  Fetterman or something and you're now running on this like a weird pro-Israel slant after 55 months. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3894.2400000000002s)]
*  Mind boggling. Go ahead, dude. Explain to me what you have an issue with. Yes, I agree with that. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3902.0s)]
*  I'm saying the older generations, fuck the older generations. And even the older generations are [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3907.92s)]
*  not on board with this. 80% of the democratic parties base people over the age of 65 say fuck [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3912.16s)]
*  Israel. Okay. They say Israel must commit to a fucking ceasefire. And they've been saying that [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3918.08s)]
*  for months. It's not even just the older generations. There are very few places where you can see a [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3924.32s)]
*  majority support for Israel. Israel is one of those places, obviously, where there is a majority [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3929.6s)]
*  support for Israel in its actions. And the other place is Congress and parliaments in the Western [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3934.88s)]
*  world. That's it. And unfortunately, those two are the power players here. If you are to analyze [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3942.56s)]
*  public sentiment on Israel, in spite of the censorious regime, in spite of the constant [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3948.8s)]
*  contextualization of unlimited violence that Israel subjects people to, Israel suggests [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3959.12s)]
*  Palestinians to, look at this fucking poll, dude. 18 to 24 year olds, whom do you support more? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3964.8s)]
*  Israel at 54%, Hamas at 46%. Just wait. This is precisely what I've been talking about. This is [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3972.88s)]
*  what I've been talking about. If the only two options are Israel versus Hamas, and people start [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3981.68s)]
*  recognizing what Israel is actually doing, they're going to be like, yeah, Hamas is awesome. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3987.76s)]
*  Fuck you mean? That's not going down. There's only going up. In chatters logs, Amazon abuses [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3991.44s)]
*  way more people than kick with gambling. Keck W. Oh, he's just a dumb fuck, like a perma-dumb [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=3997.2000000000003s)]
*  fuck, perma-contrarian. I am not pro-Israel, never been, but okay. Yes. The very fact that you have [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4002.0800000000004s)]
*  to maintain a permanently contrarian position in here and adopt idiotic framing over the course of [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4009.2000000000003s)]
*  the past fucking seemingly six years, right? And even you, a dumb fuck, can't admit that you like [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4015.28s)]
*  Israel means that the public sentiment has shifted dramatically. That's my point. Even enlightened [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4023.84s)]
*  centrist such as yourself go, ha, optically, I don't really like what you're saying about Israel's [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4030.2400000000002s)]
*  genocide. Suck my dick. Israel can suck my dick too. And you can also suck my dick. Fuck you. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4034.4s)]
*  And fuck Israel. Dumbass. Hamas wants to kill civilians? Hamas wants to kill civilians? Hamas [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4040.0s)]
*  wants to kill civilians? I think you meant Israel, right? Once again, another point that I love when [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4044.8s)]
*  Fox News uses is that Hamas is a more moral, okay, a more moral organization than the Israeli [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4050.1600000000003s)]
*  government is. This is an undeniable fact. Hamas and the Al Qassam Brigade and its military actions, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4058.5600000000004s)]
*  Hamas and its military actions were significantly, significantly more moral than Israel's [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4066.8s)]
*  genocide after October 7. Why do I say that? Look at the civilian targeting metrics and you will [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4074.32s)]
*  realize that reality. This is before, this is before we factor in the obvious reality that Israel [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4082.5600000000004s)]
*  is a settler colonial state. It is a belligerent occupier. It doesn't have a legal right to fucking [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4091.2000000000003s)]
*  even blow up the Gaza Strip, which it is a, which it is created an enclosure around, all of this [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4095.92s)]
*  stuff. It's not. Israel is a mistake. It was a 77 year long mistake. That's the mistake you have to [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4103.12s)]
*  fucking turn around and say is the mistake. Not the fact that Israel sometimes mistakenly, oops, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4112.08s)]
*  does a genocide. Israel is a settler colonial apparatus. Israel is a settler colonial fascist [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4117.52s)]
*  country. It is doing a genocide and when it wasn't doing a genocide, it was still a fucking apartheid. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4127.200000000001s)]
*  Okay. That's it. So if you have condemnations for people who actually fucking kill civilians, as I do, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4132.88s)]
*  your condemnation should be overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly against Israel because Israel [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4140.64s)]
*  is the power player in this dynamic. Hamas's very existence and Hamas's methods evolving since 1978 [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4147.92s)]
*  when it fucking started off as a goddamn Islamic charity is directly because of Israel's violence [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4155.84s)]
*  increasing. That's it. That's it. Do you think if Israel did not do the Nakba that there would be [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4162.240000000001s)]
*  this much resistance against Israel? Do you think Hamas would exist if it wasn't for fucking Israel [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4169.12s)]
*  destroying Palestinians lives? Of course not. The fuck you have to literally unironically [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4173.599999999999s)]
*  subscribe to the notion that like every Palestinian is just a barbaric rapist, anti-Semitic fucking [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4180.639999999999s)]
*  monster to actually entertain this idiotic idea. It's just pure racism. It doesn't work in any [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4185.28s)]
*  other capacity. You have to literally think every Muslim is like a barbaric rapist horde that wants [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4191.36s)]
*  to just kill all Jews and fucking cut their boobs off and play soccer with them or some shit. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4196.96s)]
*  That's it. You calling a chatter a dumb fuck after 55 months is why it's hard to support anyone on [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4201.6s)]
*  the left. Not a good look gang. Oh shit, man. You know what's not a good look? Being a 55 month [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4206.4s)]
*  subscriber and being such a dumb fuck that you still actually try to make an argument that like [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4213.28s)]
*  Israel is actually doing a genocide because people like myself are actually calling it correctly [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4216.96s)]
*  a genocide. Attributing Israel's violent actions in the Gaza Strip to someone like myself is [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4221.759999999999s)]
*  unironically dumber than anything you could have ever fucking come up with or anything that you've [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4227.679999999999s)]
*  ever heard from my mouth. Me calling that dumb fuck ass take a dumb fuck ass take regardless of [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4232.16s)]
*  the fact that he's given me 330 fucking dollars over the course of the past six years should help [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4237.92s)]
*  you recognize that I'm a fucking honest person. I don't suck up to chatters just because they've [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4243.2s)]
*  been in here for an extended period of time because when you're in here for an extended [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4248.8s)]
*  period of time your support financially is meaningless if you don't learn anything. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4252.08s)]
*  If you are in here for six fucking years constantly giving me five dollars a month to avoid the top of [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4257.76s)]
*  the hour ad breaks or whatever the fuck okay or because you love what I have to do you have to [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4262.56s)]
*  learn something. You have to learn something. Notice how I'm not actually attacking you as [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4267.4400000000005s)]
*  aggressively as I did to that guy because he's been in here for six fucking years. You only have [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4273.12s)]
*  been in here I guess sporadically for one year so obviously my smoke for you is significantly less [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4278.08s)]
*  so please don't assume that the customer is always right. This is one area where if you want me to [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4285.92s)]
*  treat you like a fucking human being if you want me to treat you like a goddamn human being you [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4290.72s)]
*  have to behave like a goddamn human being. You can't just turn around and be like I don't really [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4295.28s)]
*  like that you're being mean to a chatter okay. You are once again also exhibiting the same exact [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4299.76s)]
*  tendency that that other chatter you talk after 55 months is why it's hard for people to support [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4307.04s)]
*  anyone on the left. You are drawing a conclusion about the broader left from a fucking twitch [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4311.6s)]
*  streamer and how he is yelling at a fucking chatter who said something incredibly stupid. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4317.04s)]
*  Your expectation is what that when a 55-month chatter comes in here and says something stupid [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4323.5199999999995s)]
*  I say yes sir please sir thank you more no please give me more of your brilliant enlightened [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4328.08s)]
*  perspective after all you give me 330 dollars so whatever you say go sir is that what I should be [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4333.36s)]
*  doing is that how we build a broader leftist coalition that's what it hinges on a dumb fuck [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4338.719999999999s)]
*  twitch streamer and the resentment that he feels not only towards that chatter but the resentment [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4345.599999999999s)]
*  towards myself I feel disgusting when I have someone who has been in here for 55 fucking months [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4351.04s)]
*  and it didn't learn anything I feel like I'm a fucking failure okay motherfuckers will come [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4357.6s)]

*  radical things because you're worried your audience is going to call you out for it and then when I [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4368.320000000001s)]
*  fucking yell at a dumb ass in here they go oh he's so mean to his audience have you seen that [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQMyPq5k2s&t=4372.56s)]
