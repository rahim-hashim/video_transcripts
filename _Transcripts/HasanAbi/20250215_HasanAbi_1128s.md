# The Truth Behind Bodybuilding | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4)
*  Look at this. It's genuinely insane how much more like he had to lean out for competition from this point. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=0.0s)]
*  Like look at how he looks like here, which is already insanely low body fat percentage. He's look at his [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=18.68s)]
*  vascularity. And then in order to Sam Stulig won his first bodybuilding show. Oh my God, really? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=24.48s)]
*  It's crazy. Like [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=43.04s)]
*  dude, he is insane. Am I wild or his legs a little lacking? Maybe it's the angle and the colors. I mean, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=46.4s)]
*  not for not like I'm not comparing myself. I'm nothing. I'm nothing. I'm just saying like for the for the standards of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  of like professional competition. His upper body is insane though. Like it could literally be because his upper body [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  so crazy that his legs look kind of weaker in comparison. Jesus Christ. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=93.52s)]
*  He just didn't activate his glutes well with his poses. I think that could also [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=110.56s)]
*  process your standards are generally up. No, no, no, no, no, I'm talking about. No, you're [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=114.32s)]
*  misunderstanding. This is about like who he will face in terms of competition and like classic physique [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=119.76s)]
*  on the professional level. This is like first ever competition for the record. Yeah. This is like, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=127.84s)]
*  this is like talking about an NBA player chat. Like we're not comparing a NBA player to the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=134.4s)]
*  average person or to me. Okay. Where you would compare an NBA player to other figures in the NBA. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=141.6s)]
*  Because Sam still like at the incredibly young age of 23 is now basically an NBA like almost not, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=149.92s)]
*  not an NBA player level, but like, like a Euro league player in terms of basketball, like [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=158.64s)]
*  his legs do look better from this angle. Has Sam always been on gear? Yes. Yeah. It was definitely [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=180.32s)]
*  the lighting. Could you, could I look like this a year on creatine? Yeah, for sure. If you kept up [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  with Sam's stories, he did like three cardio sessions a day in order to get this lean. Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  The fact that he looks nowhere near Olympia level shows how insane the competition is. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. The number one in the world. Okay. This is not, this is Nick Walker. Okay. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=209.76s)]
*  That's you're talking about the mutant. All right. That's different. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=216.48s)]
*  That's you're talking about the mutant Nick Walker. That is a, he is a mutant. Okay. But you're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=221.28s)]
*  like the number one body. So was it two eggs? Pimpy is true. He is literally two eggs, Pimpy, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  the human, but the number one bodybuilder on the planet for the Arnold is, is Chris Bumstead. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=236.8s)]
*  He is now officially retired. Okay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  Auto was very own. He's the mr. Olympia classic physique winner, 2019 to 2024. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=249.68s)]
*  And the years that he was active was 2014 to 2024. And you need to know, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=257.68s)]
*  like you need to understand what he looked like when he won, what he, when he won the mr. Olympia [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=263.44s)]
*  classics. Okay. Wait, see bum retired from classic to go to open. No, no way. Really? He is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  he is. Look at this. It's genuinely insane. How much more like he had to lean out for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=279.04s)]
*  competition from this point. Like look at how he looks like here, which is already insanely low [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=294.24s)]
*  body fat percentage. He's look at his vascularity and then in order to compete, he has to go beyond [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=302.64s)]
*  that. He even has the death. What is it called? Like the skull look. That's why you know you've [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=309.36s)]
*  chat. You want to know, you want to know one of the, one of the, the classic stages of being [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=314.88s)]
*  perfectly dehydrated. That means you are ready for your, you've actually perfectly leaned out [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=322.96s)]
*  for competition is when you get this gaunt death look where they can, you get is called, I think [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=329.2s)]
*  it's called a death phase where you can see your skull. Okay. When you are, yeah. When your cheeks [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=335.12s)]
*  are completely sunken in and you can literally see the outline of your skull, this should [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=342.4s)]
*  can't be healthy yet. No shit. Of course it's not healthy. What are you talking about? This is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=350.64s)]
*  C bum. Okay. This is the, the winner, the six time winner of the classic. So there's a difference [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=354.96s)]
*  in bodybuilding. I'm not like the most well versed on this stuff, by the way, but in the professional [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=364.96s)]
*  bodybuilding competitions, there's, there's multiple different competitions. Mr. Olympia classic physique [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=372.0s)]
*  is weirdly enough, the closest that you can achieve an Arnold like physique. And then there's the open [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=377.2s)]
*  which is, which is when you just look like, you know, as much of a mutant as possible [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=385.12s)]
*  skull face talk. Oh, yeah. I used to scare people. My face was like a walking skull, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  which you don't really see on the competitors these days. You know, we used to turn it up a contest [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=399.2s)]
*  and then have a competitors meeting where you draw your numbers and you listen to the rules and all [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  that stuff. And you'll all have tracksuits on and everyone be looking around like looking at the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  faces because you can tell from the face what the body's gonna look like. The guy's a bit puffing [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=412.32s)]
*  when I used to turn up, I usually literally used to have sinews like in my jaw that you could see. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=417.84s)]
*  You could only see the muscles in my face. I was that late when you can see this shit, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  not even just this, not even your cheekbones, but like this shit, dude. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=426.64s)]
*  That is when you have dehydrated adequately and the eyes and sunken the head a little bit. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Anyway, it's not it's not a it's not healthy. But yeah, as I was saying, so this is like the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=439.52s)]
*  number one for the classic, right? Like he is the this is what the peak physique for for Mr. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=446.96s)]
*  Olympia classic looks like in comparison to where Sam Suleik is just so you have a better understanding. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=454.56s)]
*  So that's what you're comparing him to. Like look at his look at Sam's legs versus [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=460.64s)]
*  Seabombs legs and ass. So peak. Yeah, that's peak. Dr. Mike compares bodybuilding to obesity is the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=465.36s)]
*  same level of unhealthiness. I would go so far as to say bodybuilding is more unhealthy than obesity, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=472.48s)]
*  I think, depending on what level of because like obesity doesn't mean automatically obesity is not [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=476.88s)]
*  an automatic death sentence at like 40. Okay. I think steroids are probably depending on the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  severity of your obesity. Obviously, if you're like 600 pounds, then yeah, you're more unhealthy [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=492.4s)]
*  than a fucking bodybuilder. But what is exercise? Sciences critiques, RFKs, controversial health [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=500.23999999999995s)]
*  claims. Oh yeah. Dr. Mike came after RFK. Why do you follow this and not a sport like arm wrestling? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=507.84s)]
*  What I don't really I don't really follow it that much. I just know a little bit about it [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=513.52s)]
*  because it's fascinating. And because I work out that's it. I don't I don't actively follow it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=519.44s)]
*  I mean, look, I think these guys are artists. Okay. They are self-sacrificing for something for a [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=526.08s)]
*  cause greater than themselves. Look at this man. Look at what he's done to his life. Look at what [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  he's done to his body. Why? In order to prove a fucking point. Okay. This man is 23 goddamn years [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=539.7600000000001s)]
*  old. That is insane. One more muscle. What's the point? Are you kidding me? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=547.84s)]
*  To die for a cause bigger than yourself. That's the point. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  Let's get out of here. Not getting in trouble. What's the cause to be fucking brought? This is [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=577.84s)]
*  the cause you're looking at it, dude. What do you mean? What's the cause? Look at him. The point is [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=592.0s)]
*  to be unimaginably, unfathomably jacked to push this vessel that you have on God's green earth [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=597.28s)]
*  to its maximum potential. That's it. That's it. And nothing but that pushing humanity beyond [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  what we previously thought we were capable of. Look at this thing. I don't even want to call [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=619.04s)]
*  him a human being. Look at him. Two X pimpy in real life. A man who has actually peaked so hard [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=626.88s)]
*  that it is physically impossible for him to shave his face. Think about that. This is peak body. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  This is more of this shit is like thin spore for dudes. First of all, thin spoke and B for dudes too. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=651.28s)]
*  Imagine using that time and energy towards something actually purposeful. It takes a lot [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=655.76s)]
*  of time and energy to get to this point. Yeah, that's not peak performance though. This guy's [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=659.12s)]
*  not fast. Has no stamina. Isn't as strong as he could be. I'm sorry, but far beyond peak. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  You guys are such goddamn losers, dude. Oh my God. You're such nerds. Shut up. Yes, I know. I know. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=667.36s)]
*  He's not like, he's not an athlete. Okay. We're talking about dudes who literally look like pugs. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=674.96s)]
*  Okay. We're talking about dudes who look like fucking experimental dog breeds. Why do left this [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=681.52s)]
*  angry and nerdy about body fitness law? Yeah. You're talking about a dude who literally stands [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=690.72s)]
*  up for like four and a half minutes and is winded. This is sculpting your body to look a certain way. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=697.36s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Jesus Christ. Good. Fuck. Five plates. I mean, that's not that crazy. Just still. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=705.76s)]
*  Come on. Good. Five days. Good. Come on. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=722.56s)]
*  Look at his fucking calves, dude. We're creating a brand new human shapes out here. And nerds are [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=735.92s)]
*  talking about arm. Your mobility will be severely limited like that. I know. Repping 485 is not [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=740.08s)]
*  crazy. Yeah. For someone of his size and his strength. It's not that crazy. Dude. What do you [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=745.28s)]
*  mean repping four or five Bradley Martin can do this? What are you talking about? Look at how [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=750.0s)]
*  much stronger he is than Bradley Martin. Oh, just so you understand it's four 95 and I can [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=753.76s)]
*  rep, you know, I can rep 90 pounds lighter than this. Finish good. No, you can't. I literally go [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=765.6s)]
*  to my fucking Instagram. Oh, wait, was he doing? Oh, I thought he was doing regular deadlifts. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. I'm so sorry. Was he doing RDLs? Oh, that's why he was doing 485. Oh my God. I [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=779.84s)]
*  was not paying attention. Oh my God. Oh my God. Okay. I was, I didn't understand. Oh my God. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=785.84s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. That is insane. Oh my God. Oh my God. Bro. I fucking thought he [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  was deadlifting. I was like, that's not that impressive. What the fuck for a guy his size. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=812.56s)]
*  Oh my Lord. I wasn't even paying attention. Oh, he's doing full motion, stiff leg RDLs with 495. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=817.28s)]
*  No fucking belt. Jesus Christ. Bro's headed spine day. Okay. This is an insane lift. I was so wrong. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=831.76s)]
*  I apologize. When you deadlift, your knees are supposed to buckle. Okay. A stiff legged Romanian [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  deadlift means that your legs basically stay straight the entire time. As in he's doing, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=854.24s)]
*  he's doing a much more restricted hamstring activation. And I didn't even notice. Bro, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=862.8s)]
*  Hasan is turned on right now. Yeah. That is an insane, insane weight to put up. That is an [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=872.08s)]
*  insane weight to pull at 495. It is actually not an insane weight to pull at all for a man of his [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=879.84s)]
*  size and his level of experience in terms of deadlifting, which is why I was shocked, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=886.24s)]
*  not realizing that he was doing a straight up RDL. His body is so misshaped that you couldn't [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  even tell where his waist began and his knees ended. Like, look, do you see this? This is a [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  full blown Romanian deadlift completely controlled on the eccentrics at 495. Is he on steroids? Come [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=902.96s)]
*  on, chatter. The fuck? There is as crazy. His legs are out of control. It is actually insane. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=912.64s)]
*  Holy, listening to chatters discuss lifting might actually annoy me more than some of the EU chatters [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=920.32s)]
*  discuss Euro politics. Y'all got to start hitting the gym. You really do have to start hitting the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=923.9200000000001s)]
*  gym chat. Seriously. Obviously you're never going to get to this level. So don't worry about that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=927.52s)]
*  Okay. That's always funny when people are like, Oh, but if I, I'll start looking like this. Yes. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=932.08s)]

*  I can give you a 100% certainty that you will never, ever, ever look like this. Okay. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=948.0s)]
*  Never. This man has dedicated his entire life and has taken years and years of experimental [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=955.68s)]
*  cocktails to be able to look like this. Don't worry. If that's a fear you have, you will never [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=965.28s)]
*  look like him. You're the same as any other. Wow. Chatter talking about raid stats. I did 10, 10 [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=970.56s)]
*  sets of reading feminist literature and 20 reps of listening, not talking. Thank you very much. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=975.76s)]
*  You just caused one person in here to do it. Just despite you, you will never do it. You will never [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=979.76s)]
*  look like him. It's okay. It's probably not. It's probably for the best. It's so funny to think like, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=984.48s)]
*  dude, looking at this guy and thinking like, Oh, I could be just like that. If I worked hard enough [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=990.8000000000001s)]
*  is like thinking you will play basketball. Like LeBron. Okay. You watched a basketball game and [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=996.32s)]
*  you were like, yeah, yeah, I can shoot like Steph Curry. Anyway, but yeah, he is the fucking mutant [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1000.72s)]
*  for a reason. Yeah. It's like looking at faker and being like, I could play league of legends like [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1010.24s)]
*  that. I will just commit elaborate fraud to achieve this goal. No, no amount of, this is the thing. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1014.64s)]
*  You can't fake this. That's the problem. Okay. You can't fucking fake this. There's just nothing [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1021.04s)]
*  you can do about it. Sam Stulig has done a horrifying amount of steroids to get to the level. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1027.6s)]
*  And he is like, obviously nowhere near the level of Nick Walker, the mutant. And he's, he's competing [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1033.1200000000001s)]
*  on a different thing anyway, but still, what do you mean? He faked it too. He ain't Natty. Absolutely [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1039.28s)]
*  zero people think that this person was ever Natty. What are you talking about? This is one of the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1045.84s)]
*  funniest things. Like you have to be, you have to be existing on a different plane of existence. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1051.76s)]
*  If you were to ever even suggest that Nick Walker is Natty, what are you talking about guys? Like [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1057.28s)]
*  90% of Hollywood celebrities to achieve the physiques that they achieve all the way from [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1065.04s)]
*  fucking what's his face? A Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine two to four. Like they are not Natty. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  Okay. Wake up. Most of the physiques that you see on television, most of the physiques that you see [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1081.04s)]
*  on, you know, on, on men's health magazines and shit like that. And especially also on [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1089.2s)]
*  Tik TOK, none of them are Natty. There are varying degrees. Stop making fun of me for saying [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1095.76s)]
*  Wolverine. Okay. Yes. Fuck. It's the one thing. It's the one thing that I sometimes fuck up. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1101.52s)]
*  You know, this W's and N V's. Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Yes. Oh, it's my one ESL thing. Come on. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1106.96s)]
*  Obviously love and thunder. Hemsworth isn't Natty, but in general, none of them are because [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1116.56s)]
*  they get jacked in like four months. Yeah. That's part of it too, for sure. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcibMsraz4&t=1119.68s)]
