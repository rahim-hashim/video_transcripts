# UCLA Hospital Needs To Improve Service Quality | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E)
*  even in a private facility in a private healthcare structure where you're supposed to get immediate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=0.0s)]
*  service at ease and in an expeditious manner as opposed to the Canadian healthcare structure [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=5.2s)]
*  that is treacherous and slow and gruesome and people die waiting in the hospital beds or [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=10.72s)]
*  whatever. Yeah. Guess what? I had to go see my grandmother because she fell. So my grandmother, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=16.4s)]
*  uh, my grandmother fell. Unfortunately, it happens, you know, and she slipped and she fell and she [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=28.24s)]
*  might have fractured or broke her wrist. And it was a tumultuous process in, of course, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=34.24s)]
*  one of the wealthiest cities on the planet in a private hospital to get her like immediate access [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=41.44s)]
*  in the emergency room. I found out that the UCLA hospital, apparently according to Moran, who gave [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=46.0s)]
*  me some reporting from some field reporting UCLA hospital still applies triage in the emergency [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=51.04s)]
*  rooms. They left the COVID level, uh, triage facilities in place. So they actually expanded, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=58.24s)]
*  I guess like technically not expanded, but they just kept the emergency room tents in place. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=65.6s)]
*  All emergency rooms use triage, uh, not I've been to that emergency room. I don't remember it having [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  triage facilities. I don't remember it having triage facilities on, on a normal time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=78.16s)]
*  I know triage is a normal part of ER chat. No, no, you're missing. Okay. Emergency rooms, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=84.48s)]
*  when there's like a lot happening, of course have to do triage. It's not like it's a method. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=90.8s)]
*  It's something that you need to do when you have, uh, an additional amount of need for healthcare. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=96.48s)]
*  Okay. Normally under like a regular, in the middle of the day, when you go to the ER [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=102.96s)]
*  in a massive city, in one of the, in one of the local hospitals, like I didn't realize that the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  UCLA, I didn't realize the UCLA ER still has like tents that were hold over from, uh, the COVID [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  structure. Okay. And apparently that's what they do. And apparently my grandma had to still wait [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=122.72s)]
*  like a long time, even though she had fallen, she's, you know, old and she might've even hit [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=129.12s)]
*  her head and it still took like, um, you know, it still took them like a long ass time to finally [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=134.96s)]
*  get to her. And it's only after, and it's only after my, uh, my brother would like pull the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=139.84s)]
*  doctor aside and was like, my grandmother is literally 80 and she fell and she hit her head. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=146.32s)]
*  Can you please like, what, what more do we need to do for her to get seen? Um, and they finally did [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=150.96s)]
*  but yeah, it just reminded me once again, that isn't what triage is bro. I know what triage is [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=159.28s)]
*  triage is when you have a limited amount of resources and an overwhelming amount of patients [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=164.56s)]
*  happening, a overwhelming amount of patients coming in. So you have to go by risk priority. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=170.56s)]
*  You have to prioritize by who needs immediate medical attention. I understand that the problem [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=175.36s)]
*  is that I think UCLA and I will talk to my friends who work at these hospitals because there's like [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=180.4s)]
*  I mean, I know people that work in these hospitals, but I used to go to UCLA as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=189.12s)]
*  It was in the UCLA network, but basically my point is there's not enough nurses and there's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  not enough doctors. Okay. That's it. And it seems like the facilities are overloaded. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  The seems like the facilities are overloaded and instead of additional making additional hires, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=206.08s)]
*  they've decided to exhaust the existing staff with understaffing as is the case with every [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=212.88s)]
*  single hospital network in the United States of America. And the point I'm trying to make is that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=218.56s)]
*  even in a private facility in a private healthcare structure where you're supposed to get immediate [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=223.2s)]
*  service at ease and in an expeditious manner, as opposed to the Canadian healthcare structure [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=228.4s)]
*  that is treacherous and slow and gruesome and people die waiting in the hospital beds or whatever. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Guess what? It's happening in private facilities as well. And that's the issue that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  I was trying to address here. They will never increase the staff and they will literally [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=245.6s)]
*  consistently they'll utilize like existing COVID era, like COVID era structures, COVID era facilities [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  to, you know, to continue, I guess, overloading their, their healthcare staff. Anyway, regardless, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=259.52s)]
*  yeah, it's, it's so slow and expensive. I know you, you pay so much of premiums and you pay out the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=266.96s)]
*  wazoo and you still get cooked in the process is my point. Why are your ears so pale? It's because [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=273.2s)]
*  I got a haircut and you're seeing my big old ears. Regardless, regardless. So yeah, both, all the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=278.4s)]
*  healthcare professionals get overloaded in general by hospitals when you have a for-profit [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=286.24s)]
*  incentivization structure. That's it. So that was one aspect of this, but no, she's doing well. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=291.2s)]
*  She was a little zuded, had to go, had to go get her drugs, had to go get her Oxy. And my brother's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=297.76s)]
*  like asking the pharmacist, like we were so sus me and my brother, we're in this like random CVS, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=306.64s)]
*  get it, picking up an Oxy script while also simultaneous. My brother's like asking about [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=314.08s)]
*  Nyquil versus Z equal, which, which one has like a ingredient that's different. And I'm like, dude, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=319.76s)]
*  I'm like trying to tell them like, be cool, bro. What the fuck? We look like we're going to, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=325.44s)]
*  we're going to eat the Oxy's ourselves and then also make meth or something like, and I mean, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=329.52s)]
*  it was fine. They didn't stress this out because it's America. God damn it. And you should be able [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=336.0s)]
*  to, you, we have the freedom to, to eat as many Oxy's as we can and also make meth amphetamine [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=341.84s)]
*  off of Nyquil. If we want to many UCM medical centers, the opportunity doctors live in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  Palisades extra bad over there. Now my partner's a UCM employee in our health care is from UCLA. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYid9btU7E&t=352.0s)]
