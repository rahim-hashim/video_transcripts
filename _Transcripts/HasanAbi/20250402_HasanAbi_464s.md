# Biden Cares More About NATO Than America? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis)
*  Biden is right. Like there hasn't been a single photo of him after leaving office. Even his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=0.0s)]
*  St. Patrick's day photo was just a photo from a rally three years ago. Yeah. I think he's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=3.88s)]
*  probably not alive. I suspect he's he's most likely he's in a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=7.96s)]
*  little bit off topic where your joke became true that Biden only cared about NATO. Oh [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=18.46s)]
*  my god. Shut the f**k up. This is vindication that I never wanted. And I and I oh no. Ron [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=22.24s)]
*  Kline on Biden debate prep. I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=30.88s)]
*  was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with NATO leaders. Wait in NATO. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=34.32s)]
*  Oh no. At his first meeting with Biden and Aspen large the president's cabin Whipple [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=52.24s)]
*  writes claim was startled. He'd never seen him so exhausted and out of it. Biden was [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=73.0s)]
*  unaware of what was happening in his own campaign halfway through the session. The president [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=77.04s)]
*  to sit by the pool that evening. Biden met again with Kline and his team Biden aides [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=80.96s)]
*  Mike Donilon, Steve Ricchetti and Bruce Reed. Once again, right. But too early. I said in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=86.08s)]
*  July 11th NATO is Biden's bread and butter and I'm not convinced the American public [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  cares about foreign policy all that much. Jake Christman says actually yes we do care [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=94.52s)]
*  about it. Anyway that evening by the men again with Kline and his team we sat around the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  table Biden had answers on cars and he was just extremely exhausted and I was shocked [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  his interactions with NATO leaders. NATO. I did NATOization of Finland. I did NATO. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=111.72s)]
*  Aukus Jack look alive. I got my man out there. His name is Ryan Ruth. He's got 5000 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=120.4s)]
*  strong Afghan NATO trade soldiers ready to add his command. We're going to send him to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=128.96s)]
*  Kirk's. We're going to do NATO. We're going to bring Russia into NATO too. I did. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=135.04s)]
*  Watch me. Watch me. Kline Wibble writes wondered half serious you. Biden thought he was president [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=145.92s)]
*  of NATO instead of the US. He just became very enraptured with being the head of NATO. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=150.88s)]
*  He said that wouldn't help him on Capitol Hill because as Kline noted domestic political [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=154.88s)]
*  leaders don't really care what Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Schultz think. I mean Trump's version [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=159.28s)]
*  of this was constantly talking about Victor Arban. Victor Arban loves me. Kline fellow [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=164.4s)]
*  aides and visitors including Phil Mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg. Oh my God. Jeffrey Katzenberg. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=172.72s)]
*  Mr. Kweeby to mock the base were organized focusing on domestic policy. The first was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=178.16s)]
*  scheduled the last 90 minutes but Kline called it off after 45. The president's voice was shot [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=182.4s)]
*  and so was his grasp of the subject. All you could really talk about was infrastructure [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=186.56s)]
*  plan and how he was rebuilding America and 60 million jobs. He had nothing to say about [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=190.0s)]
*  his agenda for a second term. Kline says Biden grew irritable saying he would not make promises [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=192.8s)]
*  he would be criticized for failing to deliver. Biden is dead right. Like there hasn't been a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  single photo of him after leaving office even a St. Patrick's Day photo was just a photo from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=203.12s)]
*  a rally three years ago. Yeah I think he's probably not alive. I suspect he's he's most likely dead. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=206.56s)]
*  He's in a vat. They put him in a vat where he goes hubbub of the all day every day. Man [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  man this is why you pay me the big bucks because my analysis is sound and often [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=218.96s)]
*  vindicated of course far too late far too late and the resentment that people feel [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=226.08s)]
*  in that very moment sets in. OK this is why you pay me the big bucks in the form of six dollars [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  a month in the form of subscriptions or a free one in the form of a twitch prime by connecting [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=239.44s)]
*  your Amazon Prime account to your church. You get one free prime subscription a month use it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=243.36s)]
*  on your favorite prophetic streamer or you can get gifted a sub. I wish you were wrong more often [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=246.32s)]
*  to be honest. I wish I was wrong more often too. Trust me. But unfortunately my my predictions come [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  true or my analysis in that moment is sound. It's just in the direction that pisses people off. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=258.48s)]
*  Liberals were very upset at me saying exactly this. It should not take for many liberals [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=264.08s)]
*  to come to this conclusion after months and months and months a year after it's even important to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=271.28s)]
*  acknowledge these things. This is it. This is the problem. I tell you this shit at the time [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=277.36s)]
*  liberals get mad at me. Their resentment stays in their hearts and even if they encounter this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  information later down they don't go oh yeah. OK well I guess this was right. They still hate me [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=288.0s)]
*  in that process and they'll move on to the new thing that I'm saying right now and they'll get [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  mad at that like the Cory Booker stuff. OK. Right now Cory Booker is hot. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=297.2s)]
*  Cory Booker is hot right now. OK. Liberals love his ass. And I told you even then when we were [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=303.84s)]
*  watching Cory Booker's speech yesterday that this was squishy lip shit and it was going to be [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  regarded as like completely irrelevant later down the line. And if liberals learn the wrong lessons [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=316.8s)]
*  from this like oh Cory Booker is dominating the media space by by doing this like show of force. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=321.28s)]
*  But it's not really a it's not a real filibuster against like a bill that's being passed or [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=326.56s)]
*  anything like that. If liberals get the wrong lessons from this they will keep doing like weak [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=331.12s)]
*  optics over and over again beyond the weak optics of Cory Booker's filibuster. Cory Booker himself [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=337.04s)]
*  also doesn't track as like an honest broker. That's just the reality. He soft pedals. He does the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=342.96s)]
*  baby shit like emotional appeals. That's not especially when you're not [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=349.44s)]
*  you're not charismatic enough. And also on top of that you don't have any policies that you are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=356.8s)]
*  policies that people care about that will truly improve their lives. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=362.08s)]
*  And you're not passionate about said policies. No one is going to you're going to have no motion. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=367.04s)]
*  You're just not going to have any motion. So while he's hot right now all the liberal moms [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=372.72s)]
*  including my mom will say oh my god look at how brave Cory Booker is. Look how wonderful [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=376.88s)]
*  Cory Booker is. He's not going to win an election. OK. Outside of a New Jersey state race. It's just [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=381.28s)]
*  not not happening. Yes. Status quo centrist liberalism will be again and again a result [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=389.2s)]
*  will deliver a resounding defeat to the Democrats over and over again. OK. And not only that but [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=396.88s)]
*  also in terms of young voters Cory Booker is young enough and vibrant enough. Having said that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=403.36s)]
*  there's one issue that young voters do care about a lot. OK. Gaza is one of those issues. Cost of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  living and affordability crisis is another one of those issues. Cory Booker has either a bad answer [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=418.0s)]
*  for one with Gaza. He is super pro Israel. He is a friend to Rabbi Shmueli and he has gotten [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=423.2s)]
*  you know nine hundred thousand dollars from a pack. And in terms of the affordability crisis [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=432.4s)]
*  he has no answer because he's doing third way neoliberalism. So for that reason he's both not [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  charismatic enough not telegenic enough in the ways that like the public would appreciate the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=444.88s)]
*  broader public would appreciate. But on top of that he's also got no motion on the policy side. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=451.28s)]
*  What. No answer. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhok34__zis&t=457.36s)]
