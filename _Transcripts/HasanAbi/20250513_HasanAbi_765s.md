# The “Hasan Piker Problem” is Bigger Than You Think | HasanAbi Reacts to Philip DeFranco
**HasanAbi:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U)
*  for us on a react to that intro Lamont, big bodied, small headed, Phil Rosen, his son [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=0.0s)]
*  is hilarious. I skipped the intro. No, we watched it earlier. We watched it earlier. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  We watched it earlier because I saw the shorter version of this, cause he released it as a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=10.32s)]
*  short catching strays. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=15.8s)]
*  Oh, Philly D Thumbo [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=18.8s)]
*  Hassan piker at O'Hare international airport in Chicago. And I don't care if you love them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=23.8s)]
*  You don't know who the hell this is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=28.92s)]
*  We saw, we saw [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=31.32s)]
*  that everything was going to go smoothly since he was accepted into the government's global [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=32.32s)]
*  entry program. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  This is a longer, it's a longer piece about it. Okay. The actions of the U S some goober [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  called into it against Sam to talk to loaner box so we can refute what Jeremy scale says. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  I wish I was kidding. This is what I mean. This is the intersection of drama and like [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=45.52s)]
*  real journalism. That is insane, dude. That is insane. That was unironically my wake up [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  moment. Old heads know that the reason why I pulled out of like the toxicity of debate [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=59.2s)]
*  spaces wasn't because I was bad at it. Okay. Which I readily admit I'm not the best debater. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=65.44s)]
*  Right. But the reason why I pulled out of the debate spaces was specifically because [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  when I was having an conversation with Ryan Grim on a book that he wrote about the progressive [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=78.88s)]
*  movement within the Democratic Party, I believe that was what it was about. And and chatters [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=87.28s)]
*  in my community at that because at that time I was like collaborating with destiny a lot [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=94.88s)]
*  and chatters like crossover chatters were coming in to try and debate Ryan Grim in an [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=98.4s)]
*  informational setting. That was insane. It's like you're a random online commentator. This [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=107.28s)]
*  person is a primary source on the issue that he's speaking on. He is incredibly well read on this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=113.32s)]
*  He's a profile journalist. The idea that you are going to get loner box to debate Jeremy [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=118.08s)]
*  Scahill, an award winning investigative reporter that has poured his entire life into covering [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  issues in the Middle East, like spent most of his adult life doing this. The idea that like some [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=132.56s)]
*  random YouTuber is going to go in and debate this person is ridiculous, almost as ridiculous as sex [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=140.12s)]
*  pestiny. It's almost, oh, it was this the one. This is new. This is when Ryan was at my house [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=146.12s)]
*  recently. I'm talking all the way back in like 2018. I actually think this is the other way around. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=153.8s)]
*  Your disagreement with Ethan is based on his Zionism. He cloaks it in personal drama so we can fool his [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=158.12s)]
*  parasocial fans into thinking you are attacking him and therefore the issues you support are also bad. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  He is not fighting with you because you guys don't get along personally. He's fighting with [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=166.6s)]
*  you because of his Zionism. I think his Zionism contributes to it. But if you think that it's not [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=169.4s)]
*  because of his own personal distaste for me, come on, dude. I think he is not intelligent and well [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=174.12s)]
*  thought out enough. I don't think he's intelligent enough to recognize that he's like being a soldier [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=179.4s)]
*  for a Hawesboro. Anyway, it's certainly both, but I think it's more so his personal distaste, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=186.44s)]
*  his personal distaste of being, uh, his personal decision of feeling like a fool. Anyway, I don't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=198.36s)]
*  want to talk about Ethan. Who cares? Let's continue. With what just happened, you have him claiming [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  that his detention and interrogation were not random. Hassan going public and saying that he [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=207.0s)]
*  was questioned about his political views, including whether he supports Trump and whether he's connected [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  to Hamas or affiliated groups in the region and ultimately accusing the administration trying to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  silence dissent with intimidation. Right. One of the things that we need to note here because we're [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=219.24s)]
*  talking about someone trying to enter the country, we've seen a number of instances is that Hassan [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  was born in New Jersey and he's a U S citizen. He had him saying here that he was coming back into [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=226.04s)]
*  the country on Sunday after traveling to France with his family to celebrate mother's day. And [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=230.04s)]
*  with coming back to the country, he had hopes though, not expectations that everything was [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=233.32s)]
*  going to go smoothly since he was accepted into the government's global entry program, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=236.76s)]
*  which normally speeds up security checks for pre-approved low risk travelers returning to the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=239.72s)]
*  States. But instead he said what happened was that he was stopped for additional questioning [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=243.32s)]
*  and saying that it wasn't that bad, but that it was a very strange experience overall. But [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=246.92s)]
*  Hassan then later expanding on the experience in detail on his stream. They knew who I was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=250.44s)]
*  and they were ready to, they were ready to receive me. Let's just say, and it wasn't a very warm [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=254.84s)]
*  welcome. I get to the global entry line and they're processing everybody expeditiously. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  You walk up, boom, you walk up immediately. They take your photo of your face and you walk in gets [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=266.04s)]
*  to me, take a photo, boom, walk in instantly, instantly. The customs and border patrol agent [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=274.6s)]
*  goes step aside, sir. And from there, Hassan says that he was taken to a detention area to wait and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=282.84s)]
*  saying that the others that he saw there, it included terrified families and an old lady in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  a wheelchair. And that none of those that he spoke to were U.S. citizens. And then eventually being [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=291.0s)]
*  called in for questioning. And with that, Hassan then describing the conversation is surprisingly [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  cordial, but also claiming that the feeling was kind of undermined by the fact that the entire [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=298.76s)]
*  process is supposed to be intimidating. But you also had him saying that he wanted to see exactly [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=302.44s)]
*  how far CBP was going to go and noting that he was in a position of privilege to be able to do so. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  So with that saying, rather than pleading the fifth is maybe would normally be a good idea, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  he was very candid about some things, including his views on Donald Trump. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  There were definitely areas where I was was very revealing about my position, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=316.44s)]
*  knowing full well that they know exactly what they're looking for. I saw no reason to hold [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  back on certain things. So I said, I don't like Trump. I was like, what are you going to do? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=328.44s)]
*  It's it's protected by the First Amendment. I don't like Trump. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=333.64s)]
*  Hassan there saying that the interrogator seems sympathetic. And he also noted that the agent [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=336.35999999999996s)]
*  identified himself as Iraqi, which Hassan said might have been part of it and saying he might [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=340.28s)]
*  have lucked out in that regard. But that said, when he asked why he was being detained, the agent [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  reportedly told Hassan that it was routine. Hassan then claiming that rather than questions about [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=347.64s)]
*  Trump, there were Israel. They're asking me about Trump. They're asking me about like Hamas. And [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=351.4s)]
*  he kept saying stuff. He kept saying stuff like, do you like Hamas? Like, do you support Hamas? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=357.0s)]
*  Do you think Hamas is a resistance group? I kept saying a couple of different things. One, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=363.48s)]
*  in terms of like Israel and all the wars, I was like, I'm on the side of civilians. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=367.24s)]
*  I want the endless to end. I am a pacifist. I want wars to end. I just kept repeating that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=370.68s)]
*  over and over again. Every single time he asked me a question, I just kept repeating that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=376.44s)]
*  And every single time he asked me a question leading a leading question about Hamas, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  I kept saying the United States State Department recognizes Hamas as a organization. The United [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  States State Department recognizes Hamas as a terrorist organization. And from there, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=389.72s)]
*  he had Hassan saying that the questions went from being about his views to asking if he had any [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  contact or involvement with Hamas as well as the hoop. Why not record your interview with them and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  make bite-sized clips on TikTok? Could have made 500 K to donate to the PCRF. Okay. These are Hezbollah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=401.32000000000005s)]
*  Straight up. That's literally what this conversation was about. And it's not even a joke. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=409.56s)]
*  Like they literally, they straight up tried to get something out of me that I think they could [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=415.56s)]
*  use to basically detain me permanently, which is insane because there is no direct connection or [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=423.4s)]
*  direct involvement. But ultimately with all that, while Hassan speculated they were looking for a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=431.4s)]
*  reason to hold him, he said, you know, what it was really all about was intimidation. I think they [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=435.0s)]
*  did it because they know who the I am. And they wanted to, they wanted to, to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=438.52s)]
*  put the fear of God into me. Obviously the reason for why they're doing that is I think to try to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  create an environment of fear to try to get people like myself, or at least like others that would be [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=452.76s)]
*  in my shoes that don't have that same level of security to shut up. And for me, I'm going to use [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  the privilege that I have in that moment to try and see what they're doing. Okay. Because every [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=465.96s)]
*  single thing that they asked me trying to get me to say something like, oh, I support Hamas or [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=472.84s)]
*  whatever is literally not allowed. Like they are not, what do you mean? Like why is this denying me [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=476.76s)]
*  entry into the country of my birth? Like this is my birthright. This is, I'm an American citizen. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=483.88s)]
*  You can't just stop me at the border and be like, what's your opinion on Donald Trump? You're not [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=489.24s)]
*  allowed to enter the nation. The goal here is to put fear into people's hearts, to have a chilling [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=493.72s)]
*  effect on speech that like the government is unafraid of intimidating. Do you think Al Qaeda [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=500.44000000000005s)]
*  and the Taliban are based? No, I do not. In illegal ways. Okay. The government is now officially [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  willing and able to intimidate you for speech, for your speech. That is a direct violation of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=513.1600000000001s)]
*  the first amendment. Now with all of that said on the other side, you had officials denying that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=519.4s)]
*  Hassan was targeted over his beliefs during what they called a routine and lawful inspection. With [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=522.76s)]
*  notably DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, accusing the streamer of quote, lying for likes [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  and going on to say claims that his political beliefs triggered the inspection are baseless. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=531.08s)]
*  Our CBP officers are following the law, not agendas. And adding upon entering the country, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=535.0s)]
*  this individual was referred for further inspection. A routine lawful process that occurs daily and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=539.3199999999999s)]
*  can apply for any traveler. Once his inspection was complete, he was promptly released. So then you [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=543.56s)]
*  had Hassan responding to the Trump administration's defense in a statement to NBC saying, well, part [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=547.72s)]
*  of a lawful routine inspection requires DHS to question me about my political views, my opinions [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=551.8s)]
*  on Donald Trump and my stance on Israel and Palestine. Which, you know, were thoughts and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=556.52s)]
*  questions with people like Alex Peter, for example, known as Lolo, who's an attorney who's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=559.64s)]
*  popular online. And he wrote DHS flagging and detaining one of the U S's largest left-wing [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=563.16s)]
*  voices for their political opinions. While the Trump admin suggests they might suspend habeas [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=567.56s)]
*  corpus does not portend well for the future. But then also Hassan's uncle, the co-founder of the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=571.24s)]
*  young Turks, where Hassan briefly worked, also chiming in saying border agents detaining and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=575.4799999999999s)]
*  interrogating Hassan proves two things. They are targeting U S citizens as well. And adding, they [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=579.24s)]
*  asked him about his policy positions on Israel and Trump. This is a frontal attack on freedom [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=583.32s)]
*  of speech. This is when you show if you have principles or not. But ultimately with all this, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=587.32s)]
*  again, just to reiterate, I don't care if you love or you hate Hassan piker, especially because it [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=590.92s)]
*  seems like this is not an outlier in a bubble situation. We started seeing claims and stories [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=594.6s)]
*  pop up from people that were from outside the country, visiting the U S getting detained, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=599.08s)]
*  questioned, deported. And we've talked about a number of those troubling situations, but also [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=603.08s)]
*  like with what happened with Hassan, it happened as we're seeing an increase in reports from people [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=607.08s)]
*  about U S citizens being detained. Yeah, I heard about this Oxford union standing committee, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=611.1600000000001s)]
*  uh, could face criminal liability and make ongoing counter-terror investigation. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=617.24s)]
*  I know this, uh, police have been conducting increases. The union's hosting of a debate [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=623.32s)]
*  title. This house believes that Israel's an apartheid state responsible for genocide. Last term, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=629.64s)]
*  they're fucking freaks in the UK. Do you understand? They're absolute fucking freaks. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=634.28s)]
*  Now, uh, I think that this could potentially be the reason why they're not releasing my, uh, speech. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=639.48s)]
*  Ironically enough, I did actually talk about, um, I did actually talk about this, like specifically, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=646.1999999999999s)]
*  uh, this kind of, uh, government enforcement over people saying true things, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=655.9599999999999s)]
*  uh, and, and how ridiculous that is and how that actually, uh, leans into creating, uh, more [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=662.9200000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitic tendencies amongst the broader population, how dangerous that is. But yeah, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=669.08s)]
*  I saw Kid Starver's last speech. I saw pieces of it where he said, we're becoming, we're becoming [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=674.36s)]
*  a nation of, uh, of, of strangers. Tamed at the border and at airports. And we're also seeing it [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  as just socially, we're seeing an escalation with situations popping up like big mega Republican [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  accounts calling on Pam Bondi to arrest Aaron Parnas reporting news. There appears to be an [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=689.88s)]
*  escalation happening. And if you don't care about it because there's no like perfect victim for you, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=694.28s)]
*  there's not going to be. And unfortunately, as history has shown us time and time again, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=698.84s)]
*  when this is allowed to happen uncontested, eventually you and or the people that you love [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  and you care about may find yourselves in the crosshairs. Just a question of where it lands on [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=708.68s)]
*  the range of harassing to, to chill free speech to the incredibly scary, scary, darker shit. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=713.16s)]
*  For now, that is the news and then separately my opinion. And in the meantime, as we wait to see [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=719.56s)]
*  how everything plays out, I'd love to know your thoughts in those comments down below. And then [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=723.7199999999999s)]
*  I've got more news for you in just 60 seconds, but first, you know, when was the last? Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=727.4s)]
*  I mean, dude, Philly D is ringing the alarm bells on this shit. Cannot wait for us on to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  react to that intro Lamont, big bodied, small headed, Phil Rosing, as honest, hilarious. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=736.1199999999999s)]
*  I skipped the intro. No, we watched it earlier. We watched it early. We watched it earlier because [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=741.16s)]
*  I saw the shorter version of this, cause he released it as a short catching strays, dude, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=746.76s)]
*  small headed bastard who every picture it looks like he wants to make out with himself is, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=752.6s)]
*  but the situation and this new is at the very least it should make [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYIbJzUGC3U&t=756.52s)]
