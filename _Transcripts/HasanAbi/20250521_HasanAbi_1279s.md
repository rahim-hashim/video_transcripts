*  Still, that's what all of those like rich white guys were also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=0.0s)]

*  victims, which would be the black South Africans who are still in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=6.96s)]

*  the president's staff playing out a video showing these claims [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=77.28s)]
*  of in South Africa, which its leader has refuted an amazing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=81.64s)]
*  moment trace and welcome everybody. I'm Sandra Smith in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=87.32s)]
*  New York to watch this in real time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=90.16s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm trace Gallagher in Los Angeles. John Roberts has [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=93.44s)]
*  the day off. This is America reports. It really was [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=96.48s)]

*  it was very fun. And then they played the video. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=113.44s)]
*  Sandra, of these, these allegations, the video of these [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=119.0s)]
*  groups, including groups that Elon Musk has pointed out, like [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=123.44s)]
*  the economic freedom fighters that believe that there is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=126.96s)]
*  aside that have called for in South Africa, this time against [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=131.44s)]
*  white farmers, President Trump has given those farmers refugee [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=134.76s)]
*  status. He was asked a question about whether he believes there [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=138.28s)]
*  is. And he said he didn't know, but he clearly is concerned that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  some white farmers in South Africa are being targeted [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=145.16s)]
*  because he has he has done many things to try and alleviate [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=149.44s)]
*  those harms. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=152.8s)]
*  Another moment of transparency from this White House, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=153.36s)]
*  promise transparency. This went for about an hour and six [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  minutes trace. Let's bring in Peter Doocy. Our White House [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=161.24s)]
*  correspondent is standing by. Not only did they play out the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  video, Peter, but also talking about the G 20 President Trump [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=166.6s)]
*  saying he feels it's important to them for South Africa to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=170.0s)]
*  look good at the G 20. He at one point held up copies of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=173.32s)]
*  articles about South Africans saying these are deaths, deaths. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  What is the reaction so far there? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  Sandra and trace I didn't even know that you could dim the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=186.56s)]
*  lights in gates old seems like a place that would just have an [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=189.64s)]
*  on or off switch. But President Trump called for the lights to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=192.84s)]
*  be dimmed so that he could show this multimedia presentation to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=196.28s)]
*  basically call the call the visiting South African [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=200.72s)]
*  presidents bluff. The South African president came here to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=204.08s)]
*  say there is no happening in South Africa. President Trump [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  basically said, Okay, well, then what's all of this? And he [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=210.08s)]
*  showed political leaders and opposition leaders in South [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=213.8s)]
*  Africa, saying some very heinous and violent thing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=218.04s)]
*  Incredible man. Thank you. Wow, they have light dimmers in the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=221.4s)]
*  oval. That's crazy. Incredible technological developments [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=224.56s)]
*  happening. Peter do she all the words douchebags are winning, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=228.88s)]
*  and I genuinely despise it. One of the worst aspects of this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  government aside from like the metric ton of evil they're [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  contributing to is also how galvanized the stupid have [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=239.68s)]
*  gotten in the process. I hate it. I can't stand it. According to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=243.28s)]
*  their standards, wouldn't be no there would be a different if [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=248.04s)]
*  what's happening to white farmers in South Africa causes, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=251.44s)]
*  then you need a different name for what's going on in Gaza. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=254.52s)]
*  Like you can't call those two things the same thing. Like a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=259.2s)]
*  Megadr or like a super cost or something. You know what I mean? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=262.6s)]
*  Like that's crazy. Even though the house itself would have to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=266.68s)]
*  be named something different. Like it's just not you know, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  it's not comparable. It's ridiculous. You have to rewrite [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=274.84s)]
*  all the rules. The stupidest thing to me is how much credit [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=277.56s)]
*  these people give to a leader like Malema. Yes, he has a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=279.88s)]
*  following. And the EFF are nowhere near as influential as [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=281.76s)]
*  these people say they are. I think the irony is that the EFF [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=284.4s)]
*  will become more influential if the ANC government doesn't take [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=287.64s)]
*  any action in terms of offering economic restitution. Like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=291.56s)]
*  that's it. Like the the the resentment is understandable [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  because like you have to remember you have to remember [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=301.4s)]
*  something. The EFF is not arriving at this position that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=303.88s)]
*  we look at as like crazy and violent out of nowhere or [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=308.44s)]
*  because they just like racially despise white people. Their [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=312.52s)]
*  anger is born out of the false promises made by the South [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=317.04s)]
*  African government in the aftermath of the apartheid. South [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=322.92s)]
*  Africa broadly is really dubstile. That's what all of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=325.96s)]
*  those like rich white guys were also addressing as well. Some of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=330.32s)]
*  them refused to talk about the real victims, which would be the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=334.44s)]
*  black South Africans who are still in in horrifying material [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=337.6s)]
*  conditions. But that's it. There's a reason why Malema is [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=342.76000000000005s)]
*  has has gotten any popularity whatsoever. There's a couple [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=347.48s)]
*  chatters in here that are just like they have their stories. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  And they just keep spamming it like one chatter wants me to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  cover St. Louis the other one wants me to cover Adriana Smith. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  I haven't looked into it. Okay, please stop spamming the stories [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  over and over again. I know Adriana Smith is on life support. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=364.6s)]
*  So the government can forcibly extract a child out of her. It's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  a baby incubator situation. I know. It's not like I am [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=372.16s)]
*  currently covering nothing. I am doing something right now. Do [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  you see that? Do you hear that? And then the other chatters like [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  dude, cover St. Louis. I did I already did. The lack of funding [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  contributed to the the disaster the disastrous tornadoes [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  becoming even more disastrous than they normally would have [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=393.88s)]
*  for several minutes. And he just made the funniest things I [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=398.23999999999995s)]
*  have to mention here, by the way, is the metric ton of Asmongold [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=401.0s)]
*  fans who have come in here to be like, I hear Asmongold is in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  your mind. I haven't brought up his name even once today. He on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=407.2s)]
*  the other hand, I know has covered me multiple times today. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  And his dumb fans keep coming in here to bring up his name for [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=415.64s)]
*  some reason. You guys come in here and talk about how [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=418.52s)]
*  showerless you are, and how rotted you are both inside and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=421.52s)]
*  out. And and demand drama take place. Leave me the lone man. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=425.84s)]
*  Holy shit. And then the moment that I cover mold, man, they go [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=430.44s)]
*  up see, rent free, dude. It's like, no, you're the one who is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=434.44s)]
*  bringing him up. I haven't talked about it. I'm talking [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=439.0s)]
*  about the news. What would I care about what he has to say [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  about anything. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=442.88s)]
*  And the rest of the South African delegation, sit there in [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  the half dark room and watch it. And afterwards, President Trump [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=447.28s)]
*  did want to talk a little bit about trade and his visiting [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=452.08s)]
*  famous call for friends from South Africa got to speak as [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  well. He said he has not made up his mind. Despite the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  presentation that he had the staff cut and put forward, he's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=462.64s)]
*  not made up his mind yet about whether or not there's happening. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=466.32s)]
*  That is something the South African team strenuously [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  denies. And it's worth pointing out that is definitely the most [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=473.88s)]
*  awkward of all of us meeting since Zelensky was here. It ended [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=477.56s)]
*  a little bit better because I can see the vehicle. It is not [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=482.16s)]
*  leaving that the South African delegation is not leaving early. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=486.04s)]
*  They will be sticking around for lunch. But really, when you [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  watch that, it seems like the the Trump foreign policy doctrine [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  is a lot like the old slogan for the MTV show The Real World, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=496.20000000000005s)]
*  where people stop being polite and start getting real. And [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=500.84s)]
*  that's what we just saw from President Trump. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=503.88s)]
*  A couple of things there. One was a good question from South [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=506.48s)]
*  African reporter. She was asking about the G20 summit in South [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=508.6s)]
*  Africa coming up in November. President Trump said it was [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=511.48s)]
*  important that the United States be present at that didn't really [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=514.36s)]
*  commit to actually going to the G20 summit. So that's something [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=518.92s)]
*  yet to be seen. But I'm wondering about Elon Musk's hand [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=522.4s)]
*  in all of this. We know that he is South African. Elon Musk has [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=526.28s)]
*  complained again and again about that his Starlink satellite [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=529.36s)]
*  provider was not allowed to operate in South Africa, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=532.6s)]
*  primarily because he is white. I'm wondering what the reaction [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=535.96s)]
*  there was and how much that played into the videotape playing [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=540.52s)]
*  as you will in the lights being dimmed in the Oval Office. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=545.36s)]
*  Yes, so the two things in order there, President Trump saying [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  that the United States should be at the G20 doesn't necessarily [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=555.24s)]
*  mean that he is going to go just that they should have a [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=559.28s)]
*  presence and there's been some talk. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=562.4s)]
*  Where's this fucking chatter who's like, you should cover [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=565.32s)]
*  Asmongold in the same way that you should be covering you should [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  cover Theo Vaughn with the same disdain to you for Asmongold. No, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=572.72s)]
*  and it's simple. Theo Vaughn, regardless of his allegiance or [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=577.2s)]
*  sympathy for the Trump administration. And there's [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  plenty of that. Okay, he's quite literally, he went to Qatar with [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=585.24s)]
*  the Trump administration to speak to the to do a comedy show to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=590.32s)]
*  the troops there. Theo Vaughn still has an open mind, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=594.88s)]
*  especially when it comes to what is going on in fucking Gaza. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=600.9200000000001s)]
*  Okay, I'm not going to cast aside a valuable ally like that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  knowing full well that that's not the knowing full well that he [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=610.04s)]
*  is presenting a position to an audience that must hear it more [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=616.52s)]
*  than anybody else. Okay, that's it. That's my that's my [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=620.28s)]
*  strategic focus here. And anyone who doesn't understand that is [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=624.12s)]
*  being ridiculous. That's some 2004 Bush admin shit. I don't [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=629.2s)]
*  know why you're keeping a comedian so close other than [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=632.84s)]
*  careerism. What bad taking my opinion terrible opinion. He's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=634.68s)]
*  literally gesturing for Adolf Hitler. If you guys can't [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=638.8s)]
*  understand, I think it's because Zach Foster post. No, it's Zach [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=643.3599999999999s)]
*  Fox, who is right, who's right in his fucking analysis where [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=646.4399999999999s)]
*  he's like, what are we doing, bro? How about you ask the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=649.76s)]
*  fucking friends that you hang out with? He's not wrong about [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=651.76s)]
*  that. Okay. He's not. But the reason why I hype it up is [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=654.52s)]
*  because there are plenty of people who fucking love Donald [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=659.3599999999999s)]
*  Trump, who love the O'Vaughn. And those are the people who [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=663.4s)]
*  need to more than anyone else see what the O'Vaughn is saying. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=668.52s)]
*  That's it. No, you're diluted by the proximity. No, I am not [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=673.4s)]
*  diluted by the proximity. I understand how these things [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=678.36s)]
*  fucking work. This is my take. Happy to see you speaking out, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=682.56s)]
*  but it's truly bizarre watching someone who's helped Trump get [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=686.8s)]
*  elected and continues to die when Trump's family expressed [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=688.68s)]
*  confusion over something Trump has vocally supported the entire [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=690.52s)]
*  time. Yeah, no, I understand it. I do. I get it. But I don't [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=692.64s)]
*  care. Because at the end of the day, friend or not to the Trump [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=697.48s)]
*  administration, he's still a fucking comedian. If he is able [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  to demonstrate moral clarity on this issue, then that's a good [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=705.36s)]
*  thing, especially when he has a shit ton of influence and a shit [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=708.64s)]
*  ton of prominence. I would probably have less smoke for [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=711.84s)]
*  Asmongold if he did this as well. I would have less smoke [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=715.08s)]
*  for Ethan Klein if he did this as well. I'm sorry when I'm fucking [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=718.92s)]
*  in the midst of having to deal with slop tubers who in the most [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=723.0s)]
*  pathetic cowardly ways possible defend Israel's actions, yell at [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=727.8s)]

*  administration on the issue of Israel, and you're a Democratic [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=739.52s)]
*  Party politician, you should really take a cold hard look at [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=743.28s)]
*  yourself. Okay, everything else is just bullshit. That's it. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-UajLZuYM&t=746.44s)]
