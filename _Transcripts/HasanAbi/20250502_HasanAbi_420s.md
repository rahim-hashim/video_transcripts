# The Real-Life X-Files Conspiracy Is INSANE | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI)
*  Like Christian evangelical Zionists specifically that have this, this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=0.0s)]
*  exterminationist Armageddon theological justification. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=6.16s)]
*  This is real. The Red Heifer. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=9.84s)]
*  Like they're trying to... [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=11.68s)]
*  It's so... It sounds insane when you think about it, but like that is real. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=14.56s)]
*  That is a real thing. Ironically also in Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=18.16s)]
*  But I saw like something that they posted that I actually bookmarked because [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  I thought that was really interesting. It was in response. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=30.0s)]
*  It was in response to Ryan Coogler potentially doing X-Files, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=34.08s)]
*  Really wonder what Coogler's angle is here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=41.04s)]
*  Obviously you can do a fun monster of the week thing with some mythology elements [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=43.44s)]
*  in your sleep, but the core themes of the new X-Files or the core elements of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=46.32s)]
*  X-Files revolve around conspiracy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=50.72s)]
*  And that means something different now than it did in the 90s, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=52.24s)]
*  Because Ryan Coogler, for those of you who don't know, is maybe potentially [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=55.92s)]
*  thinking about doing a new X-Files. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=60.72s)]
*  But in the 90s, conspiracy theories surrounding aliens were very different [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=64.0s)]
*  than the types of conspiracy theories that exist now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=68.48s)]
*  Okay. Get Coogler on the streamer pussy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=72.32s)]
*  I love Ryan Coogler. I would love to have him on the stream. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=74.8s)]
*  That'd be sick. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=77.12s)]
*  I mean, he's been on with my queen, Amy Goodman. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=77.92s)]
*  So it's not that big of a stretch. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=80.72s)]
*  And he works with boots. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=82.48s)]
*  So it's not a stretch at all. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  As a matter of fact, considering that he works with Boos Riley and also Amy, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=86.32s)]
*  I literally have two avenues of entry into having Ryan on the broadcast. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=92.0s)]
*  Like that would be sick. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=99.52s)]
*  That would be sick. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Wait, have you had Boos Riley on? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=104.88s)]
*  I've never had Boos Riley on, but like we're moots on Twitter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=106.24s)]
*  I watched an interview where he struggled so hard not to admit he's a communist. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=110.56s)]
*  You mean Ryan Coogler? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=113.36s)]
*  You mean boots boots. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=114.32s)]
*  Riley is out and about communist. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=115.36s)]
*  I don't know about Ryan Coogler. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=117.6s)]
*  Did you see centers? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=119.2s)]
*  Yeah. I saw it early. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=119.92s)]
*  Shouts out to the RDC boys. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=121.44s)]
*  Shouts out to Mark Phillips, supreme dreams. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=122.56s)]
*  They invited me to watch an early screening of it and it was awesome. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=125.76s)]
*  And I loved it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=129.76s)]
*  Chris Konsler said he wants to come on the stream. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=131.52s)]
*  By the way, he DMed you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=132.96s)]
*  I don't respond to British. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=135.12s)]
*  I have a no British policy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Now I'm kidding. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=139.12s)]
*  I would love to have Chris on at some point. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=139.76s)]
*  Yeah. I am a big fan of his work. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  I think he's doing great. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=145.52s)]
*  He's doing great work. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  Playlist for later. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. We'll, we'll get to it in a second. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=150.08s)]
*  What was I talking about? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=152.96s)]
*  Oh, conspiracy theories, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Conspiracy theories that currently exist. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  Conspiracy theories that you can't call conspiracy theories because this is real, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  but at least like maybe covered from a perspective that's a little bit embellished. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Robert Skvarla responds. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=170.0s)]
*  The US is controlled by a cabal of UFO obsessed defense contractors who believe AI will enslave [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  society and are trying to usher in its arrival. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=175.52s)]
*  One of them might be a vampire who survives on the blood of young people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=177.84s)]
*  That is Peter Thiel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  The government has spent eight years trying to convince us Cuba, Russia, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  and China are hiding secret brain rays that they've been using the zap diplomats and CIA [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=185.76s)]
*  officers Havana syndrome. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=190.32s)]
*  Congress held hearings about a UFO crash retrieval program. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  The year ended with people freaking out over a secret government drone program [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=195.12s)]
*  and or UFO sightings over New Jersey. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=198.4s)]
*  Remember that was in December. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  I was just thinking about that as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  By the way, there was just a story in the news about a tech adjacent rationalist cult. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  The, the, what was it? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  The Zizian cult for those of you who don't know the Zizian cult didn't get a lot of motion [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=208.4s)]
*  overall, but it was very weird, but that literally is a thing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=213.52s)]
*  Tech adjacent rationalist cult that may have been involved in cross-country murder spree. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  The defense contractors that control society own or have a stake in companies with business [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=220.56s)]
*  models built around skit. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=224.72s)]
*  So algorithms in our phones, they profit off of every subset of congresspeople are motivated [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=225.84s)]
*  by a messianic cult that is running a breeding program program designed to birth a red [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=231.84s)]
*  hyper because they will think it will bring about a rapture. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=236.0s)]
*  He's talking about evangelical Zionists like Christian evangelical Zionists specifically [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=238.88s)]
*  that have this, this exterminationist Armageddon theological justification. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=244.72s)]
*  This is real. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=251.12s)]
*  The red heifer, like they're trying to, it's so, it sounds insane when you think about it, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  but like that is real. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=258.48s)]
*  That is a real thing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=259.44s)]
*  Ironically also in Israel, you have one of the members of the cabal's a rich pervert who [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=260.72s)]
*  believes only he can repopulate society. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=265.68s)]
*  So he's running a private breeding program, Elon Musk. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=268.0s)]
*  He may have as many as 50 children. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=270.88s)]
*  Oh, and he knew a notorious who was trying to do the same thing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=272.8s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein, the cabal's spirit, the influencers of propaganda is the lull the public [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  into a false consciousness so they can carry out their eugenicist technocratic agenda. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=279.04s)]
*  This also goes along with what like the conversation I had with, with Nathan tank is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  it dovetails nicely into that where Nathan was like, you don't understand. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  I've been around these people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  He and they only care about birth rates like that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=295.04s)]
*  Unironically is what they are obsessed with. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  Like I sometimes, I sometimes find myself feeling like there's no way these guys are that stupid [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=302.48s)]
*  or that insane. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=314.72s)]
*  And then lo and behold, they prove me wrong, you know, because on principle, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=316.48s)]
*  for those of you who don't know on principle, I have a policy of never assuming. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=323.36s)]
*  I have a policy of never assuming that someone I'm covering is behaving in an irrational manner. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=330.88s)]
*  Right. Because you can't do commentary or an analysis if you just assume that the person [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  that you're talking about is too stupid or too irrational or too erratic. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  Like you have to always try to figure out the rationale. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=348.72s)]
*  Even an irrational person can have like a logical through line. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=353.92s)]
*  And that's what I try to identify. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=359.12s)]
*  Usually action and reaction. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=360.88s)]
*  That's what I do in my commentary. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=362.64s)]
*  Right. But some of these are crazy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=364.08s)]
*  Okay. Some of these guys are that stupid and they are that crazy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  And I don't know what to do about it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=372.72s)]
*  I used to be a big Ethan Klein follower and immediately jumped ship here after October 7. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=374.16s)]
*  One of the leftover stream. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=377.36s)]
*  I wish you could see that so many people left this community. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=378.08s)]
*  Not because we are anti-Semitic, but we are all anti-Sinist. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=379.6s)]
*  Okay. Well, we'll get to that stuff later. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=381.76s)]
*  Okay. You save that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=384.4s)]
*  Save that for the future. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=385.6s)]
*  Weren't there Texan evangelicals breeding red heifers to send Israel? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=387.68s)]
*  Yes. Also, come on. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=390.56s)]
*  You can't tell me these guys in an alien is so funny egghead. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=392.48s)]
*  Those Christians are called accelerationists. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's a belief that you can bring about the second coming of Christ through a major [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=396.8s)]
*  world event or some other apocalyptic means. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Mike Johnson is currently living with an accelerationist pastor, by the way. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=401.12s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjX2OwFzcI&t=404.32s)]
