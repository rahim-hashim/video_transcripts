# Eric Adams Is In Trouble | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw)
*  Henry Quay are the most right-wing Democrat in the caucus. And now he's under a federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=0.0s)]
*  investigation. Bob Menendez is under federal investigation. Eric Adams is under federal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=6.96s)]
*  investigation. One must ask the question, are the Democrats this stupid? The answer is yes, they are. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=13.44s)]
*  Okay. Hey, are you going to explain this? Okay, bro. Are you kidding? Okay. Calm down, bro. This is okay. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=19.84s)]
*  Yo, yo, yo, calm down, dude. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, what? Hold up. It's okay when I joke. Okay, it's not. Yo, I'm about to get, I'm about to actually get a phone call from the feds, dude. Stop making jokes like this. It's not illegal to befriend and have hot polycule sex. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=36.16s)]
*  With the mayor of New York. Okay. It's not illegal. And if it's a crime, then arrest me, officer. Arrest me. Put me in, put me in jail. Put me behind bars. Lolo, you son of a specifically Adams in a private meeting in Manhattan, met with the aforementioned [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=66.08s)]
*  Twitch streamer at a luxury hotel in Midtown during this meeting. Adams knowingly and willfully accepted a large bribe in the form of a pallet of Zen nicotine pouches, an in-kind gift with an estimated value exceeding $50,000 delivered in exchange for Adams's commitment to grant preferential treatment in future city licensing regulations affecting the gaming industry. The bribe, the bribe took the form of an unusually large shipment of Zen nicotine pouches. Like it could, it could be anyone. It could, it's not why, why would anybody [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=84.96s)]
*  even make the, why would anybody put two and two together here? It could be anybody. Okay. Honor by the morning of August 15th, 2014, a pallet containing approximately 50,000 units of Zen, a popular smoke was nic nicotine product was delivered to a secured warehouse in Brooklyn, New York. The delivery was directly connected to the legal agreement broker between Adams and the Twitch streamer. There is not, it could be literally anyone with that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=114.96s)]
*  Anyone in every, anyone in everyone could be responsible for this. Okay. This is calm down. I'm dude from gold bars. The Zen shipments. I love it. Stop trying to distract us with your arms. Not going to work. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not trying to distract you from anything. This could be anybody. Okay. Can you guys calm down? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=144.96s)]
*  that that this indictment could be mentioning anyone. Okay. It could be mentioning anyone like literally anyone at all. Okay. I know it sounds weird when you look at that page 38 and touting the benefits. He provided the Turkish official message to the Adam staffer. Don't let the airline manager and others confuse Adams. We are the state. We are all trying to find out who did this in thing. Okay. It's just silliness. Anyway, we're going to get to the Eric Adam stuff and I'm going to go ahead and get to the Zen thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=170.0s)]
*  That's a lot of fun. I'm going to have a lot of fun with that. That was literally one of my locks for the year was that Eric Adams would get indicted and it's pretty funny. It is pretty funny to consider that. Like, you know, I, again, even before, even before this year, I told you guys like Eric Adams, so much mean potential, like one of the best, one of the greatest memes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=200.0s)]
*  like I was long on Eric Adams. Okay. Very, very bullish. Love [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=224.0s)]
*  the stock love the meme stock from the jump. Been a big [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=230.4s)]
*  proponent of it. And it's paying off so spectacularly. I would [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=234.12s)]
*  say it's paying off more spectacularly than even I [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=239.6s)]
*  assumed it would. And we have barely scratched the surface. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=242.76s)]
*  Okay, so that is what's so funny about it because he's such a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=247.8s)]
*  and he's so he's so insane overall and so shameless in his [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  pure graft. It's great. New York City mayors. I mean, the mayoral [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=258.36s)]
*  seat is just like cursed to begin with. Like I can't [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=264.56s)]
*  remember any good mayors really from this goddamn city. And [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=267.8s)]
*  Eric Adams city and Eric Adams somehow was able to push the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  needle even further. I mean, the last guy like it's got to be [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=281.52s)]
*  weird when Bill de Blasio is considered to be like better than [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=285.52s)]
*  the last sequence of mayors like Bill goddamn de Blasio. You [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=290.0s)]
*  have straight up Rudy Giuliani, America's mayor post 911 like [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  think about like all the okay, you have Michael Bloomberg, you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=301.44s)]
*  have Bill de Blasio. And now you have Eric Adams. It is so [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=306.76s)]
*  bad. It is so bad. Like every single one of these are they're [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=311.16s)]
*  all such dog monsters. For the most part. Oh, anyway, and now [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=315.64000000000004s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo wants to get back in the mantle, which is so crazy [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  cancel culture. Am I right? It's actually insane that he's the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  first sitting New York City mayor to be indicted. Yeah, it [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=330.56s)]
*  is. It is. Well, it's insane that Eric Adams is the first [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  sitting New York City mayor to be indicted on criminal charges [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  like being the first sitting mayor of Mouse City to eat [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=339.32s)]
*  cheese. Yeah, New York City mayors have always like, they've [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  always been grifters. A lot of graph there. But like, never to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=345.32s)]
*  the degree of Eric Adams, like the transparent, the transparent [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=349.8s)]
*  nature in which like Eric Adams operated was like it was like [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=354.68s)]
*  mafia style. And I think it was partially because of his police [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=357.84s)]
*  background, which I'm going to get to in a second. I OB is the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=361.48s)]
*  order of the British Empire. Oh, Robert E. Lee's birth name was [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  raga a Lola. So we're going to talk about Eric Adams on this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=368.28s)]
*  Turkish telenovela. Okay. But before we do that, let's let's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=372.64s)]
*  start. New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, the the mayor of the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=376.96s)]
*  greatest city on the planet, responsible basically for a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=383.64s)]
*  standing military that I believe is like the what seventh largest [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  army on the planet, like the NYPD, with its own submarines, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  Mayor Adams is in trouble. He's been in trouble for quite a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  while. He has had a litany of scandals throughout his entire [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=401.56s)]
*  three year tenure so far. And one of those scandals is now [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=407.24s)]
*  finally coming to fruition. The Merrick Adams did what was that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=411.48s)]
*  loving Turkey too much and I do not mean the deli meat. I mean [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=415.76s)]
*  the country to key it okay. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=421.32s)]
*  Mayor Eric Adams is facing federal charges after being [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=423.64s)]
*  indicted by a grand jury. Those charges have just been [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=426.48s)]
*  unsealed including and accepting improper campaign contributions [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  for nearly a decade. I want to bring in senior investigative [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=433.24s)]
*  correspondent Aaron Kieturski who's there at City Hall. Aaron, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=435.6s)]
*  what's the latest on these charges? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=438.36s)]
*  Well, they are as you outlined, Diane, they include your [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=439.8s)]
*  commitment soliciting improper foreign campaign donations. And [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=442.68s)]
*  importantly, these involve not only his time as mayor and while [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=446.92s)]
*  he was running for mayor, but the charges predate even that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  and stretch back nearly a decade to conduct that's alleged while [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=455.8s)]
*  he was the borough president in Brooklyn. And it had long been [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=460.36s)]
*  rumored that there was alleged corruption at the time Adams was [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  the Brooklyn borough president, but he has never been charged [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  until now. The indictment contains images of hotel suites [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  and other benefits that the mayor allegedly took as he was [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=477.12s)]
*  soliciting some of these donations. And the charges all [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  if it's wrong to love the nation of Turkey, then put me in jail. I [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=484.32s)]
*  don't want to be right. Okay, then I'm wrong. And guess what? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  Eric Adams is also in the writing the story free my [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=495.04s)]
*  mans. This is this is this is the long of the law. Okay, I'm [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=498.12s)]
*  sorry that baklava all of a sudden is a big problem. Okay, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=504.8s)]
*  he just simply said don't add is a Turkish invention and so is [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=509.8s)]
*  baklava and they came down hard. Because guess what chat, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=514.1600000000001s)]
*  everybody knows everybody knows that the FBI has been overtaken [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  by both the Greeks and the Armenians simultaneously. And [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=524.32s)]
*  they came after him because he loved Turkey too much. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=527.96s)]
*  Also say that he accepted donations from Turkey in exchange [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=532.76s)]
*  for taking an official step and that is trying to get the fire [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  department to speed up its inspection of the new Turkish [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=541.2800000000001s)]
*  consulate across the United Nations on the east side of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=545.5200000000001s)]
*  Manhattan. Wow. Wow. Oh, I'm sorry. He wanted to be [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=548.2800000000001s)]
*  efficient. He wanted to be efficient, dude. Perhaps. Oh, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  yeah, he got, which was pretty funny. Like, of course he did. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=557.84s)]
*  Because of course he did. Okay, we're going to talk about the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=562.1600000000001s)]
*  serious stuff in a second. That had long been understood to be [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  part of the investigation. But these charges make clear the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=568.52s)]
*  conduct as alleged is much broader than that. And Mayor [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=571.92s)]
*  Adams has denied all wrongdoing. How is he responding now that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=575.56s)]
*  this indictments unsealed? We haven't heard from the mayor [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=579.24s)]
*  since the indictment was unsealed mere minutes ago. But [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  we do expect the mayor to make remarks outside Gracie Mansion [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=585.12s)]
*  where he's been huddled with advisors, attorneys and aids. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  The mayor in remarks before the indictment was unsealed called [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=592.44s)]
*  these charges entirely false. He insisted he's innocent and he [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=597.12s)]
*  suggested that this is political because he was critical of the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=601.04s)]
*  Biden administration over the way it handled the migrant crisis. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=605.32s)]
*  There's no evidence of that. And the U.S. Attorney Damian Williams [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=610.08s)]
*  is expected to address the charges himself a short time [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=614.08s)]
*  from now. And I want to bring in ABC News legal contributor [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=617.72s)]
*  Brian Buckmeyer to Brian, how significant are the are these [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=620.48s)]
*  charges for one? And what do you make of what the mayor has said [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  about the allegations in general? So you pre watching [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=627.48s)]
*  this event, Eric Adams polyamory argus revealed alongside his [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  case because he was using one of his concubines for Marjorie [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=634.0s)]
*  Taylor Green, normal arc, normal politician arc, or rather, the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=637.8800000000001s)]
*  party becomes more like her. Those are two back to back [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=645.36s)]
*  boulders, by the way, straight up. Now, this is why I am [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=651.08s)]
*  better than the likes than the likes of people who are bad at [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=656.36s)]

*  once again how bad the political instincts are of the liberal [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=797.9599999999999s)]

*  and he's conservative. That's all it takes for mainstream media [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=844.68s)]
*  to immediately hype you up. Okay, no analysis, no serious [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=849.64s)]

*  Yeah, he's like, I don't. It's not that New Yorkers are mad at [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1221.9199999999998s)]

*  could put the candy crush brigade in every metro station, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1257.08s)]

*  simply don't understand that these moves were for the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1265.24s)]

*  But Aaron, let's go back to some of the backstory here, because [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1279.76s)]
*  this comes after a string of searches, and even resignations [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1283.68s)]
*  of top city officials. Are you seeing anything in the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1287.72s)]
*  indictment that indicates more charges could come down? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1290.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm still going through it. It's 57 pages, but Mayor Adams [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1293.24s)]
*  is the only defendant named in this indictment. So for all of [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1297.16s)]
*  the searches and seizures involving other top city [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1301.76s)]
*  officials of late, the federal prosecutors have chosen to [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1305.3200000000002s)]
*  indict only Mayor [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1309.64s)]
*  Yeah, increased overtime for subway duty from $4 million to [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1311.44s)]
*  $155 million. And what did you what did you have to show for [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1315.0s)]
*  that? In revenue recovery? I believe it was $100,000 in [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1319.5200000000002s)]
*  revenue recovery from fare evasion $100,000. Now explain to [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1324.92s)]
*  me if this is how you, you know, actively do good governing. Okay. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1332.88s)]
*  Also, these freaks recently recently shot a bunch of people [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1340.36s)]
*  including themselves. Remember, or maybe he just wanted to give [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1344.52s)]
*  his buddies more money. Eric Adams stole $10 million of [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1348.84s)]
*  public funds. So according to NYPD's math, that means he [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1352.2s)]
*  deserves to be shot 3, what 3,448,275.862 times. Yeah, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1354.3999999999999s)]
*  that's like, yeah, that's 3 million, almost 4 million times [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1362.84s)]
*  the fare evasion that he did with the $10 million of public [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1366.88s)]
*  funds that he stole. Why can't a politician in an amazing job [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1371.44s)]
*  just be happy like a great public servant making a few [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1374.48s)]
*  hundred thousands of dollars a year and live in a dope house [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1376.64s)]
*  for free? Why do they immediately need to try to become [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  corrupt, multi bajillionaires? Because you don't get to that, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1381.3600000000001s)]
*  dude, it's the mayor of New York, the position itself is [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1384.88s)]
*  literally for you is designed so that you are hyper militant [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  against like any poor person, your job is to basically [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1394.48s)]
*  maintain your you're completely captured by real estate [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1398.4s)]
*  developers. You're completely captured by by corporate [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1402.3600000000001s)]
*  landlords. And your job is to basically punish any non white [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1406.44s)]
*  person or any poor person as aggressively as you possibly can [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1411.56s)]
*  and purge Manhattan from the unwashed masses. That is like [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1416.28s)]
*  that is the only type of person you're Yeah, you're a Wall [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1421.92s)]
*  Street puppet. That is the only type of person who can ever get [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1425.0800000000002s)]
*  to that position of power in New York. He sounds like a normal [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1428.4s)]
*  New York mayor. That's the beautiful part about this. He [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1431.0400000000002s)]
*  is and this is a very Trumpian phenomenon. He is a very normal [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1433.96s)]
*  New York mayor. It's just that he didn't do the proper [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1438.2800000000002s)]
*  paperwork number one, and he also went above and beyond in [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1441.68s)]
*  his corruption. And he did it in a very way. That's what's [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1444.88s)]
*  funny about this entire process. I also do personally, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1448.0400000000002s)]
*  I also do personally believe that, you know, this is a [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1451.92s)]
*  byproduct of, of capitalism withering away, like the [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1455.3200000000002s)]
*  institutions, and and even like creating people, creating [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1459.68s)]
*  people that are not even interested in hiding their [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1466.48s)]
*  graft, right? hiding the obvious theft of public resources, like [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  they're just becoming more obvious with the with the ways [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1478.16s)]
*  in which they steal. That's all it is. And it's it's very I [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1482.92s)]
*  mean, it's Trumpian Trump did it very out in the open too. And [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1486.48s)]
*  what are the consequences for it? Basically nothing. As long [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1490.6200000000001s)]
*  as you are buttering the bread of those wealthy people in [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1494.3200000000002s)]
*  positions of power. Most people usually turn a fucking blind eye [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1501.0800000000002s)]
*  to this as long as you also follow the proper protocols. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1505.32s)]
*  That's why I always laughed about the Bob Menendez stuff [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1509.3999999999999s)]
*  too. Like he is like, historically corrupt. And he [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1511.9199999999998s)]
*  still got elevated by the Democratic Party. Even before [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1515.6399999999999s)]
*  this second indictment in federal investigation into Bob [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1519.9199999999998s)]
*  Menendez. He already had that exact same investigation once [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1523.32s)]
*  Henry quay are we knew that the FBI had raided his compound. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1527.2s)]
*  And Nancy Pelosi still went out there and defended him alongside [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1532.56s)]
*  Jim Clyburn, Henry quay are the most right wing Democrat in the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1538.88s)]
*  caucus. And now he's under federal investigation. Bob [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1544.44s)]
*  Menendez is under federal investigation. Eric Adams is [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1548.64s)]
*  under federal investigation. One was asked the question, are the [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1552.3600000000001s)]
*  Democrats this stupid? The answer is yes, they are very [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1557.3600000000001s)]
*  stupid. For the record, they are very, very stupid. And the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1560.36s)]
*  way in which the ways in which the our politicians like grift [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1563.9199999999998s)]
*  this way, gets dumber and dumber and more transparent every day [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1569.1999999999998s)]
*  because they don't even feel the need to hide that they're there. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1572.8s)]
*  These vultures monsters are basically eating away the corpse [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1576.1999999999998s)]
*  of American Empire. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1580.24s)]
*  Adams at least for now, that doesn't mean charges couldn't be [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1581.36s)]
*  superseded, there could be additional defendants. But for [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1584.6s)]
*  now, the mayor is the only one we should say that even before the [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1587.36s)]
*  indictment was unsealed, federal agents arrived at Gracie Mansion [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1591.6799999999998s)]
*  to give the mayor a summons to appear in court. We still don't [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1595.96s)]
*  know when that date will be, but we believe it'll be early next [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1600.36s)]
*  week. He was also searched again at Gracie Mansion. And there was a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1603.28s)]
*  subpoena for his electronic devices. So now twice in less than [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1608.6799999999998s)]
*  a year, Mayor Adams has had his devices seized by federal agents [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1613.28s)]
*  in India. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1618.16s)]
*  One of the funniest aspects of this is that there is like a [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1618.68s)]
*  legal way of doing this, like the American government, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1621.2s)]
*  American governance, the American, the American structure [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1624.48s)]
*  has basically serialized and processed. Okay, as long as you [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1629.24s)]
*  do the proper paperwork. That's why it's so funny. When these [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1634.24s)]
*  guys are like, man, I really want to just like get outside of [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1638.96s)]
*  the realm of lobbying. Like the difference between what Bob [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1642.84s)]
*  Menendez does and what every other politician does is that he [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1645.8s)]
*  doesn't have the proper paperwork from like a, like a [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1649.04s)]
*  fair registered lobbyists. You know what I mean? That's the [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1652.48s)]
*  difference. They just, they didn't fill the proper forms in [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1655.32s)]
*  this circumstance, you know, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1658.1999999999998s)]
*  indication that perhaps they think some of the conduct may be [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1660.12s)]
*  ongoing. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1663.36s)]
*  Aaron, what do you make of that timing them issuing that search [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1664.3999999999999s)]
*  and seizing his phone, for example, on the same day that [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1667.8799999999999s)]
*  their issue appear in court? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1671.8s)]
*  The mayor is not happy about it. I've heard from a number of his [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1673.36s)]
*  aides who said, including his lawyer who said, if they had just [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1676.12s)]
*  asked us, we would have given over the phones, the mayor has [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1680.08s)]
*  been cooperative. He has said he would cooperate. But federal [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1682.28s)]
*  agents don't really roll that way. If they're going to arrive [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1686.72s)]
*  at a location expecting to seize evidence, they're going to go in [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1689.8799999999999s)]
*  with a with a search warrant, a subpoena and not necessarily [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1693.6s)]
*  wait for a defendant to cooperate. So I think it's fairly [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1697.28s)]
*  common practice, even though the mayor is taking it as an [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1702.2s)]
*  aggressive step. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1705.48s)]
*  Aaron, put this into context. How significant is this from a [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1706.48s)]
*  history standpoint for this city? The first time we're now [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1709.92s)]
*  seeing a sitting mayor indicted. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1713.08s)]
*  There have been 110 men who have served as mayor of New York City. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1714.48s)]
*  Until now, none of them had been accused of a crime, let alone a [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1718.64s)]
*  federal crime while in office. So this is an unprecedented case. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1724.44s)]
*  Mayor Adams is the first sitting mayor to face criminal charges. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1729.88s)]
*  He is going to fight them. But he has been under investigation [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1734.04s)]
*  for about a third of his tenure. He's three years into a four [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1737.3200000000002s)]
*  year term. And he is facing a number of calls from within his [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1740.92s)]
*  own party for his resignation. So far, the mayor says he is [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1744.56s)]
*  going to continue to lead the city he was elected to lead. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1748.24s)]
*  Here's some really funny moments from the indictment. Okay, one, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1751.84s)]
*  Eric Adams got a voluntary meeting with the FBI, excused [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1755.72s)]
*  himself to go to the bathroom and deleted messages and [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1759.08s)]
*  communications that they were asking him about in the bathroom [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1761.36s)]
*  break. Adam Staffer also agreed to speak with FBI agents and [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1764.1999999999998s)]
*  falsely denied the criminal conduct of herself and Adams [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1767.52s)]
*  among others. At one point during her voluntary interview, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1769.8s)]
*  the Adam Staffer excused herself to a bathroom and while there [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1772.3999999999999s)]
*  deleted the encrypted messaging application she had used to [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1775.12s)]
*  communicate with Adams, the promoter, the Turkish official, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1778.08s)]
*  the airline manager and others. Incredible stuff. More more on [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1781.28s)]
*  that front. The indictment claims that Adams campaign [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1787.52s)]
*  staffer told a potential donor that Adams probably wouldn't [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1790.0s)]
*  want to accept illegal donations, but then checked with [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1792.3999999999999s)]
*  Adams and learned that he was actually totally cool with it. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  On June 22, 2018, the same day as the fundraising event just [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1798.6799999999998s)]
*  described the Adam Staffer and the promoter discussed by text [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1802.8799999999999s)]
*  message a possible trip for trip by Adams to Turkey. The promoter [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1805.04s)]
*  stated in part fundraising in Turkey is not legal, but I think [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1809.2s)]
*  I can raise money for your campaign off the record. The [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1812.88s)]
*  Adam Staffer inquired how will Adams declare that money here? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1815.64s)]
*  The promoter responded he won't declare it or will make the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1818.48s)]
*  donation through an American citizen in the US a Turk. I'll [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1822.68s)]
*  give cash to him in Turkey or I'll send it to an American. He [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1825.72s)]
*  will make a donation to you. The Adam Staffer replied I think [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1829.12s)]
*  he wouldn't want to get involved in such games that might cause a [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1832.28s)]
*  big stink later on, but I'll ask anyways, the Adam Staffer then [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1835.48s)]
*  asked how much do you think you would come? How much do you [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1839.3600000000001s)]
*  think would come from you? The promoter responded maximum 100K [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1842.64s)]
*  the Adam Staffer wrote 100K. Do you have a chance to transfer [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  that here? We can't do it while Eric is in Turkey to which the [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1850.24s)]

*  conversation, Adam Staffer asked Adams, Eric Adams, whether the [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1856.88s)]
*  Adam Staffer should pursue the unlawful foreign contributions [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1861.08s)]
*  offered by the promoter and contrary to Adam Staffer's [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1864.4399999999998s)]
*  expectations. Eric Adams directed that the Adam Staffer [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1866.48s)]
*  pursue the promoter's illegal scheme. He was like, yeah, no, I [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1871.3999999999999s)]
*  would like that very much. Please. Can you prove that this [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=1876.1599999999999s)]

*  joining us now action seeing the way this indictment has been [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2410.3199999999997s)]
*  handed up and the charges that prosecutors are listing here [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2414.3599999999997s)]
*  yeah Diane so I am still combing through these some 57 page [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2417.2s)]
*  indictment with five counts I'm somewhat shocked when I when I [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2420.72s)]
*  start reading the first pages and I see that this [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2424.52s)]
*  investigation spans back to I believe 2014 back when Eric [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2426.48s)]
*  Adams was a Brooklyn Borough president then giving us some [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2432.28s)]
*  updates from 2018 and then following into the 2021 election [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2434.88s)]
*  this seems as as as Aaron was was alluding to an investigation [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2438.28s)]
*  and activity that allegedly spans back about a decade now [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2442.48s)]
*  and so to look and see how he's being charged what he's being [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2446.52s)]
*  charged with and just the volume of information again I'm still [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2449.4s)]
*  working through it but 57 pages this is somewhat shocking to me [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2453.0800000000004s)]
*  and I'm interested to really get into the details of it and Brian [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2456.48s)]
*  we haven't said it is too soon he's done so much it's hard to [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2460.2000000000003s)]
*  read all of the things that he has done so excuse me I need some [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2465.36s)]
*  more time or get from the mayor since the indictment was [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2470.4s)]
*  unsealed I got a but he has talked in general responding to [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2474.64s)]
*  the allegations that have come out of these investigations and [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2478.2s)]
*  essentially denied all allegations up until this point [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2481.3199999999997s)]
*  so how do you expect his attorneys to mount a defense to [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2484.56s)]
*  what's in that indictment or at least the part of it I've [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2487.88s)]
*  allowed you to read so far I know you guys are going through [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2490.12s)]
*  this while we're literally on the air but but what do you how [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2492.24s)]
*  do you think he's going to defend against this difficult and [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2495.2s)]
*  my quick scan of the indictment I'm seeing that there are photos [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2497.88s)]
*  of the lavish lifestyle that that the allegedly the Turkish [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2501.68s)]
*  government gave to Eric Adams I'm also seeing some [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2504.8799999999997s)]
*  correspondence that look like text messages between [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2508.56s)]
*  individuals and we know that a number of cell phones a number [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2511.52s)]
*  of electronics were taken so correspondence and [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2516.3599999999997s)]
*  communications between people are going to be at the heart of [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2518.3599999999997s)]
*  a case like this the only thing I can think about arguing in a [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2520.72s)]
*  case that has conspiracy to commit to commit fraud wire [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2524.2799999999997s)]
*  fraud solicitation by of contribution by by a foreign [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2528.56s)]
*  agent and bribery is lack of knowledge that mayor Adams was [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2532.44s)]
*  doing his job wasn't aware of where the money was coming from [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2536.52s)]
*  or where it was going to or for the purpose of it that he [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2540.24s)]
*  thought this was all above board but as I read these [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2542.96s)]
*  allegations as I look at what they're investigating I think [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2545.12s)]

*  not a defense for Eric Adams who definitely knew what he was [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh4uRZ1Kmuw&t=2584.16s)]
