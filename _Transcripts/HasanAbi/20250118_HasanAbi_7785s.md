# Exciting Fundraising Match for Wildfire Relief
**HasanAbi:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA)
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3.0s)]
*  Okay, I like it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=6.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=8.0s)]
*  Come on, come on, finish. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=11.0s)]
*  So big. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=13.0s)]
*  It's so much bigger than me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=14.0s)]
*  I don't want to do an eye. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=16.0s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, MBs. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=17.0s)]
*  We are currently on our way to an undisclosed location to play basketball, to play pickup basketball 2v2 in an effort to fundraise wildfires that have happened all over Los Angeles, California. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=25.0s)]
*  We're going to be fundraising for wildfire recovery and relief efforts for the firefighters and for numerous organizations. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=43.0s)]
*  Shout out to Josh Richards, who is spearheading these efforts on his stream and in an effort to cross pollinate and collaborate. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=50.0s)]
*  I told Josh, listen, TikTok is getting banned. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=61.0s)]
*  You're a TikToker first and foremost, even though you're now like a Barstool podcast host as well. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=63.0s)]
*  But Josh, I'm down. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=68.0s)]
*  I'll be there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=70.0s)]
*  Now that the American government is taking away one source of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=71.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=74.0s)]
*  Now that the American government is taking away one source of your income, I will also take away your pride by destroying you in the marketplace of basketball. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=76.0s)]
*  That's what I told him, except I didn't tell him any of this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=85.0s)]
*  And I don't even know if he's good or not. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=88.0s)]
*  He might actually be a baller, like straight up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=89.0s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=92.0s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=93.0s)]
*  I'm going there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=97.0s)]
*  And my partner in crime today is going to be face swag. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=99.0s)]
*  Face up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=102.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=103.0s)]
*  Face swag, for those of you don't know, plays COD, plays a bunch of different games. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=104.0s)]
*  He is dope. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=108.0s)]
*  I'm supposed to be on his podcast at a certain point as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=110.0s)]
*  But it's going to be a Twitch V TikToker Twitch streamer versus TikToker 2v2. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=112.0s)]
*  We're going to be playing horse and we're going to be doing two on twos. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=120.0s)]
*  Now, I'll be honest. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=124.0s)]
*  Swag is going to carry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=129.0s)]
*  Swag is going to absolutely carry. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=131.0s)]
*  And the reason why I say that is because he played college ball. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=133.0s)]
*  The NAIA, I think. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=138.0s)]
*  Not NCAA, but it doesn't matter. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=141.0s)]
*  He still played college ball. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=143.0s)]
*  So he played. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=144.0s)]
*  He's a real one. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=146.0s)]
*  I've heard great things about his prowess, his acumen, his skill, his game IQ, all of that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=148.0s)]
*  His competitive nature. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=155.0s)]
*  These are things that I've heard about face swag. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=157.0s)]
*  But most importantly, we have that phase connection, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=160.0s)]
*  He's face swag. I'm face Hossie. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=166.0s)]
*  And together, we are going to not only defend the honor of Twitch, the video game streaming platform, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=169.0s)]
*  but we're also going to be defending the honor of phase. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=178.0s)]
*  We're going to be phasing up and never really phasing down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=181.0s)]
*  So get excited for that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=185.0s)]
*  I hope you guys are excited for that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=187.0s)]
*  And on that note, March, you can flip the camera back to yourself for a second really quickly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=189.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=197.0s)]
*  I just want to... [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=198.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was a really inspiring speech. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=199.0s)]
*  I'm really hyped for basketball right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=200.0s)]
*  How long until we get there? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=202.0s)]
*  It's going to be 30 minutes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=204.0s)]
*  We have 30 extra minutes to get there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=205.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, the reason for why it's going to take 30 extra minutes for us to get there is because of the wildfires. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=209.0s)]
*  So yeah, you can't get mad at me on that one. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=215.0s)]
*  I did not realize, I did not foresee this trek taking this much, this much time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=218.0s)]
*  Hi, chat. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=230.0s)]
*  We can, we don't have to play it again. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=232.0s)]
*  I think we do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=234.0s)]
*  Oh, no, we won't play it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=236.0s)]
*  Oh, we play it for 36 minutes straight? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=241.0s)]
*  Same song? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=242.0s)]
*  This is going to be... OK, we'll play something else then. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=243.0s)]
*  So, I wasn't expecting to be on camera today. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=251.0s)]
*  I just woke up. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=255.0s)]
*  What the fuck? So what are you, are you claiming that you're not? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=257.0s)]
*  I didn't shower. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=259.0s)]
*  I just woke up. I'm violently hungover if I'm being real with you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=261.0s)]
*  I can't believe you said yes to this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=265.0s)]
*  It's Friday. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=267.0s)]
*  I asked you knowing... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=268.0s)]
*  Because I'm a down-ass B. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=269.0s)]
*  I know it's Friday. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=271.0s)]
*  And I know this is going to be a Saturday morning for you, early morning for you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=273.0s)]
*  And that's the reason why I was like, are you sure you want to do this? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=278.0s)]
*  What's plan B? You're going to carry the camera yourself? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=281.0s)]
*  You're going to replace me? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=284.0s)]
*  I would have planted it or I would have gotten someone else to... [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=286.0s)]
*  Oh, so there are other people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=288.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, there's other people who would be down to, you know, roll up. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=290.0s)]
*  It's devastating, no. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=296.0s)]
*  Okay, you won't allow it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=299.0s)]
*  I won't allow it, yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=301.0s)]
*  Well, you know... [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=303.0s)]
*  I'm a down-ass B. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=304.0s)]
*  You're the reason why I'm not going to the inauguration because you're selfishly going to Japan already. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=305.0s)]
*  First of all, you don't want to go to the inauguration. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=309.0s)]
*  That shit would be lame and it's freezing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=312.0s)]
*  I know, but it's... [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=316.0s)]
*  You would hate it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=318.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about how funny the content would be to interview like cold Trump supporters out in the cold being like, oh man. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=320.0s)]
*  That would be good. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=327.0s)]
*  That would be really good, actually. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=329.0s)]
*  I was excited to see my Lord and Savior, Donald Trump. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=330.0s)]
*  He would have... He's the best man. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=334.0s)]
*  He's the best possible man for me. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=337.0s)]
*  I love him. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=340.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=342.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=346.0s)]
*  Another banger, by the way, just for the record. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=347.0s)]
*  Another Grimes banger. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=351.0s)]
*  Just saying. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=353.0s)]
*  Would you not agree? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=357.0s)]
*  No, this is a good one, too. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=358.0s)]
*  For a while, I forgot they were two different songs when being real with you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=360.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=363.0s)]
*  And you just reminded me they are, so I will acknowledge this is another one. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=366.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=371.0s)]
*  Look, I'm going to say yes to live streaming. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=372.0s)]
*  Like, I enjoy it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=375.0s)]
*  It's what I'm here to do. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=377.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a little hungover. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=380.0s)]
*  What? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=382.0s)]
*  You never pulled up to the stream a little hungover before? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=383.0s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=386.0s)]
*  It's not going to stop me. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=388.0s)]
*  Not really. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=390.0s)]
*  Never, actually. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=393.0s)]
*  Because I take my job seriously. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=395.0s)]
*  Unlike other people. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=397.0s)]
*  I would argue I take my job even more seriously because I do that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=399.0s)]
*  And Chad's definitely with me on that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=405.0s)]
*  Here, suck on a six milligram Zim. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=411.0s)]
*  That would be amazing, actually. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=413.0s)]
*  Lock in. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=415.0s)]
*  Lock in, dude. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=417.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=419.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm back. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=420.0s)]
*  Hassan drugs his employees to push for. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=424.0s)]
*  For better efficiency. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=429.0s)]
*  For maximum efficiency, Hassan drugs his employees with crippling addiction drugs. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=431.0s)]
*  Oh, we also have Kaya with us as well. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=439.0s)]
*  She's just in the back, in the backpack. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=441.0s)]
*  I don't know if you guys can see her from here, but... [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=445.0s)]
*  I've been trying to get an angle of her. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=447.0s)]
*  She's... [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=449.0s)]
*  There she is. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=451.0s)]
*  Kaya! [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=453.0s)]
*  Hi. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=455.0s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to play the next song. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=461.0s)]
*  This one is... This is the actual Banger Banger one. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=463.0s)]
*  I think this is my favorite. It's better than Oblivion, I think. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=466.0s)]
*  It's kind of like playing with fire, listening to so much rhymes. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=470.0s)]
*  Given the current situation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=473.0s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=475.0s)]
*  I feel like, you know... [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=476.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=478.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=480.0s)]
*  Just like... [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=482.0s)]
*  Why make the target on your back big? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=483.0s)]
*  Given her... [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=486.0s)]
*  Extensive... Oh, with Elon? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=488.0s)]
*  Yeah, our new president. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=490.0s)]
*  Where's the banger? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=495.0s)]
*  I've never heard this one before. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=503.0s)]
*  Wait, really? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=505.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=507.0s)]
*  I listen to music. I know music. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=533.0s)]
*  Man, it's just so weird. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=535.0s)]
*  Sick and tired of the haters claiming I don't know music and listen to music. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=537.0s)]
*  It's like a specifically... [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=545.0s)]
*  surreal experience for me. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=547.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a fan of music. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=549.0s)]

*  I'm not a fan of music. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=559.0s)]
*  It's a surreal experience for me. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=561.0s)]
*  Just profoundly hungover with a splitting headache. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=563.0s)]
*  You never listen to music. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=565.0s)]
*  And the one time you do, you're blasting rhymes at 11 in the morning. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=567.0s)]
*  Okay, first of all, it's 12. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=571.0s)]
*  We're officially in the afternoon, okay? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=573.0s)]
*  It's after noon. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=575.0s)]
*  And secondly... [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=577.0s)]
*  I mean, what do you want to play? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=579.0s)]
*  No, this is great. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=581.0s)]
*  What do you want to play, DJ? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=583.0s)]
*  I just wasn't ready for it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=585.0s)]
*  It just caught me off guard. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=587.0s)]
*  This is good. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=589.0s)]
*  This is like video game music. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=595.0s)]
*  This is like grinding Path of Exile music? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=599.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=601.0s)]
*  This is what Elon listens to when he's definitely playing Path of Exile 2 on his account. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=603.0s)]
*  And not the Chinese bot farmer that's, you know, playing on his account. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=611.0s)]

*  Marge is not showing himself on camera, but he's literally going like this. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=669.0s)]
*  It's good, it's good, look, I like it, it's good. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=673.0s)]
*  We'll play something that's not Grimes for once. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=679.54s)]
*  Give it up for sister realness. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=682.36s)]
*  ["Sister Realness"] [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=685.36s)]
*  I wonder if this entire portion is gonna be DMCA and muted. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=696.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=700.56s)]
*  Probably, right? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=701.48s)]
*  I don't know how that works, like on IRL streams, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=702.8800000000001s)]
*  like if it's like low and in the background, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=705.32s)]
*  does that still catch on? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=707.48s)]
*  I don't know why I'm asking this question [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=709.96s)]
*  because like even if chat responds to me, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=711.24s)]
*  how am I gonna see it? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=713.08s)]

*  Play Ethel Cain. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=732.72s)]
*  I don't think I've ever listened [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=735.1600000000001s)]
*  to a single Ethel Cain song. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=736.5200000000001s)]
*  I have no idea what she sounds like. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=737.7600000000001s)]
*  I'm down, I'm down to listen to her music. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=740.32s)]
*  No, I don't, I've never listened to her either. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=742.84s)]
*  March, can you pull it up on YouTube on my phone? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=745.0s)]
*  What, Ethel Cain? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  This is good, I'm vibing to this. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=749.12s)]
*  Play the jungle. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=751.84s)]
*  Oh, come on, after this. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=754.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=755.08s)]
*  Can you field me some questions from chat at least? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=763.64s)]
*  So we can. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=765.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to, but they're just all dancing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=766.36s)]
*  Chat, stop dancing. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=770.5200000000001s)]
*  Normally there would be some contentious ass chatters [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=775.0s)]
*  being annoying, you know what I mean? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=777.1600000000001s)]
*  Will this car get turned into a streamer car [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=779.4000000000001s)]
*  like NMPs escalate? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=781.2s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=783.64s)]
*  I'm working on potentially getting Starlink as well. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=794.24s)]
*  So. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=799.68s)]
*  Hitting it from both angles, huh? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=800.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=802.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=804.68s)]
*  You don't choose sides in the divorce. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=805.52s)]
*  I'm telling you, I'm a dude, JD Pandon. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=806.96s)]
*  He is saving TikTok. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=809.92s)]
*  He's gonna extend it 90 days, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=811.52s)]
*  and then after that he's gonna save it permanently. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=813.08s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=815.76s)]
*  Number two, he is saving Palestine. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=817.36s)]
*  He did the ceasefire, okay? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=822.6s)]
*  He did the ceasefire so hard [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=824.9200000000001s)]
*  that Itamar Ben-Gavir actually had to quit. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=826.36s)]
*  You know, he's making the f**ks quit [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=829.48s)]
*  because he loves being a third-worldist. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=830.9200000000001s)]
*  In my mind, Donald Trump loves being a Maoist third-worldist. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=834.4s)]
*  MAGA, more like MAOGA, okay? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=839.8s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  Maoists Against Government Acquisition. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=849.48s)]
*  That's what MAGA stands for, truly, in my heart. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=854.28s)]
*  So. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=857.9599999999999s)]
*  All I'm saying is, JD Pandon, he's doing the damn thing. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=861.9599999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk, also good in my book [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=866.24s)]
*  because he's the shadow president. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=870.32s)]
*  Elon Musk, that's literally Shanghai Elon, okay? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=871.16s)]
*  Tesla factories in China obviously cut a side deal [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=876.08s)]
*  to ensure that the budget reconciliation clean resolution [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=882.48s)]
*  did not pass specifically [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=886.88s)]
*  because he didn't want additional scrutiny [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=888.88s)]
*  for those who dare to do trade [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=890.8000000000001s)]
*  with our foreign adversary, China, right? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=893.52s)]
*  Elon Musk being one of the main people [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=896.8s)]
*  who trades with China, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=899.84s)]
*  sidestepped in the last second [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=902.72s)]
*  and basically tanked that part of the bill. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=906.56s)]
*  It was bipartisan, too. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=909.8s)]
*  Why did he do that? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=912.16s)]
*  Because he wants to continue good relations with China. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=914.52s)]
*  Donald Trump hung out with Xi Jinping. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=918.4s)]
*  We got it, oops. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=923.16s)]
*  Ah, I love St. Angeles highways. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=925.36s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=927.5600000000001s)]

*  seeking to address [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1011.68s)]
*  regardless of world chances or anything like that? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1014.8s)]
*  Because I think that they're, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1018.5999999999999s)]
*  you know, they're decent. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1021.28s)]

*  They're not necessarily, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1024.48s)]
*  I mean, I can't, living in the United States of America, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1025.3999999999999s)]

*  I don't have much room to be like, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1029.28s)]
*  oh, they have no shot at like winning, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1030.56s)]
*  especially considering that they're at least more, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1033.32s)]
*  I mean, they at least have a functioning, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1037.24s)]
*  historically relevant [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1040.24s)]
*  socialist communist party. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1045.76s)]
*  So we don't have any of that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1047.76s)]
*  here in the United States of America, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1050.28s)]
*  at least in like contemporary American politics. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1051.64s)]
*  So I wonder what they, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1057.24s)]
*  what their day to day looks like, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1060.28s)]

*  I want to also understand the demographic makeup [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1084.6799999999998s)]
*  of the party as well. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1086.48s)]
*  Is it like the youth, the Japanese youth, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1087.3999999999999s)]
*  or is it mostly just like old commies? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1089.04s)]
*  Do they get government repression? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1092.08s)]

*  in a country like Japan [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1105.52s)]
*  that has been so thoroughly eviscerated by American politics, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1107.1599999999999s)]
*  considering that the United States of America [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1110.84s)]
*  literally wrote their constitution? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1112.68s)]
*  Like, what does that look like? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1116.9199999999998s)]

*  I mean, we can, we haven't actually fully fleshed out, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1146.24s)]

*  in the prior Japanese trips that I've done [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1241.4s)]
*  is wake up super early in the morning, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1244.16s)]
*  probably around 12 p.m. Pacific time, and go live, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1246.24s)]
*  which would be like around five, six a.m. my time. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1250.4s)]
*  Go live, do a couple hours of news coverage, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1254.4s)]
*  and then try to hit something early [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1258.68s)]
*  that is like somewhat politically relevant, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1261.68s)]
*  like do an IRL that is like politically relevant, you know? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1266.04s)]
*  And then after that, we swap over to Will [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1272.76s)]
*  and we continue with the fun [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1276.3600000000001s)]
*  because that hits his hour, his time slot perfectly as well. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1281.76s)]

*  The camera, like hook it onto it or something. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1300.28s)]
*  Potentially. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1304.4399999999998s)]
*  And then you can turn it to yourself for now anyway. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=1306.04s)]

*  Oh no worries. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2548.84s)]
*  We can play out there. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2549.84s)]
*  So what does your guys' remote setup look like? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2550.84s)]
*  Yeah we'll have... [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2553.84s)]
*  This is your guy right? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2554.84s)]
*  Yeah yeah this is March. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2555.84s)]
*  March is my producer. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2556.84s)]
*  We're already live right now. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2557.84s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2558.84s)]
*  We can figure out a way to like beam it to your stream too potentially. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2559.84s)]
*  This is live right now by the way. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2570.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2571.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2572.84s)]
*  We're going to take a break and reset it right now. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2573.84s)]
*  Oh for sure. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2576.84s)]
*  So we'll read for the 49 hours. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2577.84s)]
*  So then I think it's the perfect time for us to transition in. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2578.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2581.84s)]
*  So does that mean like are we going to end on both platforms? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2582.84s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2587.84s)]
*  Will we end on both platforms? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2588.84s)]
*  Just tell people to come back kind of thing? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2589.84s)]
*  Yeah I think you guys can still be streaming but we're going to end on both platforms. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2591.84s)]
*  On our side? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2594.84s)]

*  Yeah my husky. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2630.84s)]
*  I just put her in the room with my girlfriend so she can chill. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2631.84s)]
*  Look at this big boy. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2635.84s)]
*  What's up? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2637.84s)]
*  Hey man. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2638.84s)]
*  So we're running out of stream link and I just said that you might not like him. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2639.84s)]
*  Oh I was gonna stream his POV off this backpack if that works. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2664.84s)]
*  But I think we're gonna have your feed on our channels. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2668.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2671.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2672.84s)]
*  How do you want to do that? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2673.84s)]
*  You tell us. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2676.84s)]
*  I'm counting on you. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2677.84s)]
*  I mean it would be a situation where I'm not sure how you want to display it but it could [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2678.84s)]
*  really be as simple as you guys capturing the stream from his stream. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2682.34s)]
*  That's what I was thinking too. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2686.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2689.84s)]
*  So like this way I just take your Twitch link right? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2690.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2691.84s)]
*  That's probably the easiest way to set it up. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2692.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2695.84s)]
*  Okay cool. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2696.84s)]
*  And if you run into any issues with that we can figure it out. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2697.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2698.84s)]

*  I don't want to point the camera at anybody that doesn't want to be on stream right now [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2721.84s)]

*  You guys did you ball? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2800.84s)]
*  I haven't balled in a while. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2801.84s)]
*  I haven't balled in a long while. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2802.84s)]
*  Do you guys ball? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2804.84s)]
*  I mean I play basketball every so often. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2805.84s)]
*  I think you guys we were talking about it. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2808.84s)]
*  Our strategy was like maybe we're just going to have to take the charge over. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2811.84s)]
*  That was on the concrete. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2814.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2816.84s)]
*  I was going to look on the line. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2817.84s)]
*  I was going to thought so I can stream from anywhere but I was going to look up if there's [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2818.84s)]
*  like an actual basketball court around here somewhere we can go to like a public one. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2822.84s)]
*  But I don't know if you guys are down to do that. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2826.84s)]
*  Is it better here? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2828.84s)]
*  Is it better here just because of. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2829.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2831.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2832.84s)]
*  I think just because we have so many people coming through they want us to stay close [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2833.84s)]
*  by. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2835.84s)]
*  No there is one literally like like walking distance. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2836.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2840.84s)]
*  That is where the pickleball courts are. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2841.84s)]
*  I haven't seen it but I know exactly which one. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2843.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2845.84s)]
*  There is a long way right here. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2846.84s)]
*  Like there's one walking distance from here. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2847.84s)]
*  It is like it's like actually a maybe five minute walk. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2848.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2852.84s)]
*  In the parking lot with all the people right here. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2853.84s)]
*  No it's like. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2854.84s)]
*  It's a community park. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2856.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2858.84s)]

*  I'm open to it if you guys are cool with it. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2864.84s)]
*  As long as we can transition. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2866.84s)]
*  I think it's a matter of transitioning because I know you guys are on time as well. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2867.84s)]

*  I'm good with that. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2875.84s)]
*  So then if we move people just come in here to us. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2876.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2880.84s)]

*  Right. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2882.84s)]
*  So before we do let's just make sure that works and then go with that. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2883.84s)]
*  It's such a different beast. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2886.84s)]
*  Last year. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2887.84s)]
*  Then like anything I've ever done. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2888.84s)]
*  Oh for sure. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2889.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2891.84s)]
*  I don't go 24 7. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2892.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2893.84s)]
*  And like we've done you know like we had a sketch show that we did last year that's like [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2894.84s)]
*  you know you've got to do the pre-production. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2898.44s)]
*  You know there's a writing that you're doing. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2899.44s)]
*  There's the cat like there's a lot of steps to it. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2901.44s)]
*  It's a lot of setup but it's still just not even close to the same like anything live. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2903.44s)]
*  There's a little technical difficulty can wreck the entire 100 percent. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2908.6000000000004s)]
*  And the setup you have to do to just make sure that you're like 72 hours is going to [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2913.84s)]
*  go wrong. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2917.84s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2918.84s)]
*  I can't I can't imagine what like Kai's got to set up for when he's going for his. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2919.84s)]
*  No it's a whole that's a whole. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2923.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2925.84s)]
*  That's a whole different piece. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2926.84s)]
*  That's all it ever. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2927.84s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2928.84s)]
*  What's the longest you do you ever do like long kind of streams or you more like continuous. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2929.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2932.84s)]
*  Days or you just more like I go for no I think so. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2933.84s)]
*  I don't like sleep on stream basically. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2938.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2941.84s)]
*  But I haven't really stopped streaming continuously. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2942.84s)]
*  Like I stream eight to ten hours every single day. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2945.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2947.84s)]
*  And I've been doing that for like the past seven days a week for the past five years [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2948.84s)]
*  at this point. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2952.84s)]
*  You never take the day off. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2953.84s)]
*  Sometimes like for travel I have to. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2954.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2958.84s)]
*  But outside of that. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2959.84s)]
*  Like Christmas you're not taking off. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=2960.84s)]

*  It's like right on the street. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3124.12s)]
*  It's like yeah. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3125.12s)]
*  Oh I think it's probably less than half a mile. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3126.12s)]
*  Like he's super super useful. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3127.64s)]
*  We'll go like that we'll go play like pickleball and stuff over there. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3130.16s)]
*  Oh okay. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3132.9199999999996s)]
*  Fire. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3133.9199999999996s)]
*  But yeah it's a nice little public court. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3134.9199999999996s)]
*  How you feel about Tik Tok in shut down? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3136.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3138.6s)]
*  I don't think it's. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3139.6s)]
*  The last thing I saw was Trump's gonna push it 90 days. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3140.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3144.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3145.24s)]
*  Don. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3146.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3147.24s)]
*  The Don. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3148.24s)]
*  JD pond Don baby. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3149.24s)]
*  He's gonna fix it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3150.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3151.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3152.24s)]
*  So that's the last thing I saw. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3153.24s)]
*  I mean what do you think about what do you think about the fact that like every single [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3154.24s)]
*  person that you know is voting and saying like Tik Tok should be banned Tik Tok should [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3156.92s)]
*  be banned having all their money into metal. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3160.2799999999997s)]
*  Like have you seen that? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3164.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3165.2s)]
*  I mean for sure. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3166.2s)]
*  That's a glaring the obvious conflict of interest. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3167.2s)]
*  What's really funny to me is that this administration the Democratic Party basically pushed for [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3169.12s)]
*  this they push it over the finish line. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3174.08s)]
*  Trump originally wanted to ban it too. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3176.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3178.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3179.64s)]
*  President and then he was like I'm not gonna do it. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3180.64s)]
*  And then Democrats were like let's do it and they got real gung ho about it. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3181.64s)]
*  They got like bipartisan consensus even though most Americans don't want to ban 170 million [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3184.92s)]
*  people in the United States of America on Tik Tok. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3191.96s)]
*  Seven million small businesses on Tik Tok. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3195.04s)]
*  That's what I was. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3197.08s)]
*  How many small businesses and people's livelihoods like yeah is completely wiped off. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3198.3199999999997s)]
*  It's insane to think about and that's like before you think of the content creators too [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3203.48s)]
*  like that's just straight just small business. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3208.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3210.2799999999997s)]
*  Content creators can find ways to you know transition to a different platform. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3211.2799999999997s)]
*  You know if they were smart with their money they should be set up. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3214.36s)]
*  But people that like you said are doing you know like they're running their small business [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3217.68s)]
*  off of Tik Tok. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3222.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3223.04s)]
*  So you got that. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3224.04s)]
*  I think it generates like 11 billion dollars in revenue or something. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3225.24s)]
*  And what's funny about it is also the reality that it's actually owned by American businesses [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3228.64s)]
*  like ByteDance has institutional investors. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3235.4s)]
*  So you got American wealthy people who have ownership over the company as well. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3238.72s)]
*  You got Tik Tok employees that have ownership stake in the in the company as well. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3243.7599999999998s)]
*  And you know there's a bunch of American people like American citizens that work at Tik Tok [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3248.72s)]
*  that have ownership over Tik Tok too. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3253.7599999999998s)]
*  So it was just like insane thing that they just kind of pushed across the finish line [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3256.3199999999997s)]
*  out of nowhere. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3261.2s)]
*  And then why are they banning like what they say the reason why I mean the reasons is because [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3263.08s)]
*  it's like yeah they were like oh it's a Chinese company and it's like you're giving your data [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3267.24s)]
*  the Chinese Communist Party or whatever. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3272.6s)]
*  But it's like one they already claimed like oh they don't actually do anything with it [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3274.9199999999996s)]
*  but one day they might. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3280.64s)]
*  Two our data is bought and sold by every company. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3282.72s)]
*  So that's what I always meant to me it felt like it was just like I feel like Zuck wants [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3286.6s)]
*  to be the one that can sell my data instead of Tik Tok. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3290.2s)]
*  I feel like that's what this battle is all about. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3293.56s)]
*  It's just they want to make the money off of selling my. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3295.12s)]
*  Yeah Suckerberg wants everybody to be stuck watching Instagram Reels basically. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3297.04s)]
*  That's what it is like because they stand to benefit because they see Tik Tok as a market [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3301.7999999999997s)]
*  competitor and they don't like it. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3306.12s)]
*  Of course there are definitely people though that don't like that. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3307.52s)]
*  Tik Tok has like less restrictions on what you can and can't say specifically around [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3310.8s)]
*  like Israel Palestine for example. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3316.0400000000004s)]
*  OK OK. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3317.7200000000003s)]
*  So that was like a big deal for a lot of people they like a lot of like the ADL and all these [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3318.7200000000003s)]
*  other like groups that were pro-Israel pushed Congress to be like the kids they're saying [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3324.6400000000003s)]
*  stuff about Palestine on there like we have to stop it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3330.8s)]
*  They're not educated on it. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3333.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3334.5600000000004s)]
*  So that was like a big deal too because then technically if it's not owned by like an American [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3335.64s)]
*  or an ally I guess then you don't have like a lot of control over what kind of messages [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3341.48s)]
*  go viral on there. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3347.2s)]
*  So they don't like that either. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3349.6s)]
*  You know too much Luigi Mangione posting on there and people go right. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3350.84s)]
*  We need to deal with this. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3354.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3355.7999999999997s)]
*  The kids are the kids are getting a little too excited at the prospect of like wealthy [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3356.7999999999997s)]
*  people you know getting getting. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3359.68s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3361.68s)]
*  So then that was another reason why they wanted to ban it. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3363.02s)]
*  But yeah you're right. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3366.38s)]
*  It's it's mostly like Meta Google like all these guys have competitive products like [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3367.38s)]
*  YouTube has YouTube shorts. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3372.18s)]
*  Meta has Instagram reels and like they don't like the Tiktok has eaten up so much of that [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3373.66s)]
*  market share and because they can't beat it with a better competitive product. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3378.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3382.54s)]
*  They're just like let's ban it all together. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3383.54s)]
*  So all those forces came together. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3384.96s)]
*  The Democratic Party pushed for this bill and then it was obviously immediately brought [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3386.46s)]
*  into the courts went all the way up to the Supreme Court. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3392.1s)]
*  The Supreme Court unanimously 9-0 including the Democrats like the liberal justices said [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3394.62s)]
*  we're following on this ban. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3400.12s)]
*  And then yesterday the Democratic Party comes out and is like all right my bad we actually [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3402.4s)]
*  messed up a little bit. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3406.3399999999997s)]
*  Let's we're going to try to save Tiktok for 36 hours. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3407.3399999999997s)]
*  So they said they're going to give a stay of execution basically for 36 hours and then [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3410.42s)]
*  allow Trump to deal with it once he's president. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3414.5s)]
*  And it's like okay you literally already banned you pushed to ban the company and now you're [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3417.54s)]
*  saying oh we don't want to ban it actually my bad. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3422.34s)]
*  Oh also I'm hearing myself so I guess are you guys are you guys good on that front. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3425.3s)]
*  Audio is good or just got to get him locked back in. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3430.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3434.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3435.66s)]
*  Do you know me or are you good? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3436.66s)]
*  I mean I'm going to beat me in a second. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3437.66s)]
*  Okay let me know let me know. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3439.06s)]
*  So all of this they did all this and now they're like oops we fucked up. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3440.06s)]
*  Trump is saying he's going to he's going to give he's going to offer like a 90 day protection. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3445.5800000000004s)]
*  Problem is the way the legislation is written it's a five year period and the way they punish [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3450.6200000000003s)]
*  it the way they punish companies is it's actually not Tiktok that gets hit with a penalty. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3457.0200000000004s)]
*  It's actually YouTube I mean Google or Android and what's the other I mean Apple. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3462.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3470.26s)]
*  They get $5,000 like the Department of Justice can come in and say $5,000 in fines for every [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3471.6200000000003s)]
*  user. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3477.2200000000003s)]
*  So that's $5,000 times $170 million for simply hosting the app on your app store. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3478.2200000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3486.1000000000004s)]
*  So for that reason Tiktok is now in this like unique predicament where they're saying like [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3487.1000000000004s)]
*  they're going to shut it down on January 19th like they're going to shut up themselves [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3492.0200000000004s)]
*  are right. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3495.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah they've been saying like we're going to shut it down we're not selling it because [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3496.7400000000002s)]
*  why would they. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3499.34s)]
*  Like that's crazy. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3500.38s)]
*  Hey you have something that's like really valuable. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3502.1800000000003s)]
*  We want it now like we're going to brute force it out of your hands like it's banned. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3505.7000000000003s)]
*  It's all you get banned or sell to us. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3508.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3511.06s)]
*  It felt like the push was that's exactly what it is. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3512.06s)]
*  So so now Tiktok is saying like okay you're saying that like we're going to be in this [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3514.42s)]
*  legal limbo for 90 days. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3522.34s)]
*  But the legislation states clearly that they could just restore the ban at any moment. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3525.22s)]
*  And just fine us. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3532.2599999999998s)]
*  Like Trump could say I like Tiktok I love Tiktok right now but two weeks from now you [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3533.74s)]
*  could be like just kidding I hate Tiktok and just boom immediately hit Apple with this [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3537.9s)]
*  like crazy suit. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3542.94s)]
*  And then and then cause them a bunch of legal penalties or because the length of the ban [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3545.2599999999998s)]
*  the length of the legislation is five years even after Donald Trump gets out of office [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3552.5s)]
*  let's say he protected the government for four years the next administration come in [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3557.9s)]
*  and do it. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3561.1s)]
*  So for all of those different reasons there they're saying like we're probably still going [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3562.9s)]
*  to go black shut it down. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3568.02s)]
*  Yeah go dark. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3569.62s)]
*  Do you think they'll do it for five years. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3570.62s)]
*  Like do you think they'll just be this five year period where Tiktok won't exist and [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3572.38s)]
*  then it'll come back five years later. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3575.42s)]
*  No I think that they're just not going to I don't think they're going to sell it and [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3576.9s)]
*  I don't think that they're going to ban it either. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3580.02s)]
*  I've been saying that I don't think it's going to get banned. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3581.7s)]
*  Yeah I agree. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3583.7s)]
*  I think they have to like it's a weird it's a weird Mexican standoff where it's like basically [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3584.9s)]
*  it's a weird standoff where Tiktok is saying like we have this valuable product Americans [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3593.02s)]
*  like it if you want to cook yourself go ahead and the American government is like we're [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3598.18s)]
*  the American government like how dare you try to you know yeah enforce this thing on [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3604.42s)]
*  us like. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3609.66s)]
*  The American government is supposed to always be the enforcer. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3610.74s)]
*  Yeah they're like no we're the ones who make the rules. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3612.62s)]
*  So that's the situation. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3615.58s)]
*  Yeah you know. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3617.94s)]
*  Yeah would that be a Mexican standoff though. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3619.2599999999998s)]
*  Are there supposed to be three people in a Mexican standoff. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3621.46s)]
*  I thought isn't there. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3623.54s)]
*  I'm going to get me. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3624.8599999999997s)]
*  Why is he Mexican. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3626.18s)]
*  I think a Mexican standoff is three. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3628.7s)]
*  If I'm someone's a Guatemalan standoff in the chat. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3630.8599999999997s)]
*  OK. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3634.1s)]

*  The one that. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3650.7s)]
*  Of course. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3651.7s)]
*  No I get it. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3652.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3653.7s)]
*  It's always difficult. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3654.7s)]
*  Dude the hard part of the stream thing has been. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3655.7s)]
*  We've been trying to get the like obviously we don't want people to be like donating to [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3659.7s)]
*  the charity throughout like you know how like gifting is a big thing on Tiktok lives have [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3664.66s)]
*  you ever seen anything. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3668.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3670.7000000000003s)]
*  Because obviously you know 50 percent of it then goes to bite things like they take 50 [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3671.7000000000003s)]
*  percent of whatever people get. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3677.98s)]
*  That's crazy crazy push does that to the. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3679.5s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3682.34s)]
*  Like the subs and whatnot. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3683.34s)]
*  But do they do that with bits too. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3684.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3687.14s)]
*  It's like when you purchase it or automatically like you're giving money to the platform to [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3688.14s)]
*  purchase the bits. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3692.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3693.1800000000003s)]
*  So we've been trying to set it up where we get like we can put a sticker on the stream [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3694.1800000000003s)]
*  So then people can just donate to the charity and then they only do. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3698.6200000000003s)]
*  I think then it's like three percent gets taken instead of 50. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3701.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3705.26s)]
*  But it's the most tedious process of all time. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3706.26s)]
*  Like they just haven't built out there. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3708.42s)]
*  Their lives are well yet. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3711.0600000000004s)]
*  So that's why it's kind of taking a second. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3712.5s)]
*  So sorry. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3715.1000000000004s)]
*  No it's all good. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3716.1000000000004s)]
*  I understand how it works. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=3718.82s)]

*  Like damn [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7603.0s)]
*  What do you think about him selling the company and then buying it back for a dollar [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7608.64s)]
*  I'm not sure what happened. Like so what happened there? So I don't know the exact details [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7613.8s)]
*  I [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7618.08s)]
*  Don't quote me on this, but this is what I believe is what happened. They [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7619.88s)]
*  sold to Penn national [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7624.32s)]
*  Then [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7628.0s)]
*  he had a [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7629.84s)]
*  Like an aqua higher in the in the contract, right? Like he had to stay at the company for another [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7631.64s)]
*  Five or seven years after it was sold because they knew Dave was he's the key man [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7637.72s)]
*  He's the key man [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7642.28s)]
*  So they needed time to find out what the transition was gonna be and everything [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7643.24s)]
*  Then Penn national [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7646.76s)]
*  sold to Disney [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7649.48s)]
*  During this like five-year span where Dave was still at the company bar school. Yeah, Disney [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7651.8s)]
*  Didn't want anything to do with Dave [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7657.12s)]
*  They didn't want to be buying into Penn which owned bar still so Penn had to get rid of bar school [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7660.2s)]
*  That is so that actually worked in his favor [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7666.24s)]
*  Because he sold it for 500 million or a little bit over 500 million and then bought it back for one dollar [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7668.84s)]
*  I [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7677.16s)]
*  think it was I [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7679.04s)]

*  I think he took over 150 from and then yeah bought the company back [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7692.0s)]
*  For a dollar and then in the clause. I think it's something like Penn national will get [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7696.679999999999s)]
*  50% if they ever sell again, but he's never gonna sell it [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7703.64s)]
*  Why would he he already sold it made all this money and then now he has like this toy [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7707.0s)]
*  That's his company that he can just do [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7711.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah if I was in that position that'd be sweet [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5Ci_mwETA&t=7719.32s)]
