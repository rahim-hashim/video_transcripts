# Trump Collaborates With Netanyahu To Seize Control Of Gaza | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4)
*  Isn't it the right time to eat? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=0.0s)]
*  To eat the nuclear facilities once and for all. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4.8s)]
*  I appreciate you saying that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6.0s)]
*  They're not weak. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=8.0s)]
*  Bro, what the hell is this guy? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=9.0s)]
*  Journalists in the building are like, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=11.0s)]
*  why can't we hit Iran's nukes? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=13.0s)]
*  You know, I signed a very strong proclamation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=15.0s)]
*  That guy's not a journalist. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=17.0s)]
*  That's an insane person, dude. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=19.0s)]
*  They didn't have money for Hamas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=21.0s)]
*  And Trump is now live with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=23.0s)]
*  Mr. President, what would happen if you hear from the Israeli side today that they're not willing to go through with the deal to get all the hot s*** out and finish the war? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=53.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=72.0s)]
*  Whatever happens, we'll be prepared to handle the situation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=73.0s)]
*  Are the Saudis demanding a Palestinian state? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=76.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=81.0s)]
*  Are the Saudis demanding a Palestinian state? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=82.0s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=83.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=84.0s)]
*  Are they demanding a path towards a Palestinian state or any other recognition of that sort? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=85.0s)]
*  Everybody's demanding one thing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=88.0s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=89.0s)]
*  Peace. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=90.0s)]
*  We want peace. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=91.0s)]
*  We want people to stop being c***ed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=92.0s)]
*  But everybody's demanding one thing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=94.0s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=96.0s)]
*  Peace. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=97.0s)]
*  And he wants peace also. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=98.0s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think it's politically possible in Israel to get this deal done until the end? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=99.0s)]
*  To get the deal done? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=107.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=108.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't a deal get done? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=109.0s)]
*  A deal can get done. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=110.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=111.0s)]
*  We're dealing with very complicated people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=112.0s)]
*  But a deal can absolutely get done. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=115.0s)]
*  Mr. President, I just rarely strike on Iran. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=117.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=122.0s)]
*  President Trump, I welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=124.0s)]
*  We have heard Joe Biden and Donald Trump take credit for the hostage and ceasefire deal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=127.0s)]
*  Who do you think deserves more credit? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=134.0s)]
*  I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=138.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=146.0s)]
*  He sent a very good emissary. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=148.0s)]
*  He's helped it along. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=151.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'll just tell you, I'm happy that they're here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=153.0s)]
*  And I'm sure the President is happy that they're here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=157.0s)]
*  And I would think that's about enough. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=160.0s)]
*  Mr. President, what about the Israeli hostage hell in Iraq? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=162.0s)]
*  What about the Israeli press taking a press conference in Israel and not in Washington? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=166.0s)]
*  We would love to take a press conference in Israel to interview Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=170.0s)]
*  A few more questions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=175.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, do you support going forward with this deal and getting all the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=176.0s)]
*  hos-s-s-s out? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=181.0s)]
*  I support getting all the hos-s-s out and meeting all our war goals. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=182.0s)]
*  That include destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities and making sure that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=187.0s)]
*  Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=193.0s)]
*  All three. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=196.0s)]
*  And those things go together? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=197.0s)]
*  Can you promise to the families that you do have a use in getting the hostages out? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=200.0s)]
*  I think that I should talk to President Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=204.0s)]
*  I'll ask, do you agree with Trump's vision of getting all the hos-s-s-s back home, even [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=207.0s)]
*  if it means to end the war? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=212.0s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure that you articulate correctly what the President's vision is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=214.0s)]
*  You can ask. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=220.0s)]
*  He can speak for himself. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=221.0s)]
*  He does that very, very well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=222.0s)]
*  I have my own views, three goals. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=224.0s)]
*  Not one, not two, three goals, and I will meet all three goals. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=227.0s)]
*  I think the President can help enormously. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=232.0s)]
*  He brings fresh thinking. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=234.0s)]
*  Any address to the parties that have changed, who murdered hundreds of people, who listed [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=236.0s)]
*  their own or the part of the deal? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=240.0s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=242.0s)]
*  We can't forget it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=244.0s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=245.0s)]
*  And you can't forget it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=247.0s)]
*  They got the right wing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=248.0s)]
*  Some people want to put it out of their memory, but we're not going to ever let that happen. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=249.0s)]
*  Why are you using the del-east? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=253.0s)]
*  That was a horrible, that was a horrible period of time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=255.0s)]
*  And a lot of people like to pretend it didn't happen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=259.0s)]
*  It happened. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=262.0s)]
*  It's a big group of people that like to pretend it didn't happen, like the Holocaust didn't [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=263.0s)]
*  happen. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=267.0s)]
*  Same mindset. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=268.0s)]
*  And now we're going to, we're going to get this thing wrapped up and we're going to get [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=270.0s)]
*  it done. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=274.0s)]
*  We're also dealing, I think, very successfully with Russia, Ukraine. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=275.0s)]
*  We're going to hopefully get that one done at some point in the not too distant future. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=279.0s)]
*  That's a complex problem also. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=283.0s)]
*  But we, we solve problems. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=286.0s)]
*  We'll, you know, when I left, we had no problem. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=288.0s)]
*  There was no Ukraine and Russia fighting. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=290.0s)]
*  There was no October 7th. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=292.0s)]
*  There was nothing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=294.0s)]
*  And some very poor leadership led to a lot of problems and a lot of d-t. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=295.0s)]
*  And it's a shame, but we'll put it out. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=300.0s)]
*  We'll put out the fires. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=302.0s)]
*  A lot of fires, but we'll put them out. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=303.0s)]
*  Mr. President, why do you still support a Palestinian state like the peace plan you [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=305.0s)]
*  presented in January 2020? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=310.0s)]
*  Is this plan still on the table? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=313.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of plans change with time and a lot of d-t has occurred since I left and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=315.0s)]
*  now came back. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=320.0s)]
*  This d-t occurred not while I was here, but while somebody else was here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=322.0s)]
*  It shouldn't have happened. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=326.0s)]
*  They shouldn't have allowed it to happen. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=327.0s)]
*  It would have never happened. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=329.0s)]
*  And that includes Russia. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=330.0s)]
*  Ukraine would have never happened. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=331.0s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=333.0s)]
*  Not even a chance. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=334.0s)]
*  But now we are faced with a situation that's different, in some ways better, and in some [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=336.0s)]
*  ways worse. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=341.0s)]
*  But we're faced with a very complex and difficult situation, but we'll solve, we'll solve the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=342.0s)]
*  problem. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=348.0s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you expect? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=349.0s)]
*  Do you get from Gaza, out of Gaza, if not Jordan, Egypt, what other countries you think [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=351.0s)]
*  might accept Palestinians from Gaza? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=356.0s)]
*  Well, I think Jordan and Egypt will, I know they've spoken about it with you and they [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=358.0s)]
*  say they're not going to accept. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=363.0s)]
*  I say they will. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=364.0s)]
*  But I think other countries will accept also. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=365.0s)]
*  I think that Gaza maybe is a definition site right now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=368.0s)]
*  If you look at Gaza, it's all, I mean, it's hardly a building standing and the ones that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=372.0s)]
*  are are going to collapse. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=376.0s)]
*  You can't live in Gaza right now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=378.0s)]
*  And I think we need another location. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=380.0s)]
*  Yeah, the guy sitting next to you did it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=381.0s)]
*  That's going to make people happy. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=383.0s)]
*  You look over the over the decades, it's all in Gaza. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=385.0s)]
*  This has been happening for years. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=390.0s)]
*  It's all that if we can get a beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=391.0s)]
*  and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be not be knifed like what's happening [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=397.0s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=403.0s)]
*  And right now you have in Gaza, very dangerous explosives all over the place in terms of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=404.0s)]
*  tunnels that nobody knows who's in the tunnel. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=410.0s)]
*  The whole thing is a mess. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=412.0s)]
*  And I think that if we can resettle and I believe we can do it in areas where the leaders [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=414.0s)]
*  currently say no. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=420.0s)]
*  I mean, I've been saying that with Mexico having to do with the border and all of the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=421.0s)]
*  things. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=426.0s)]
*  And you saw what happened. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=427.0s)]
*  Ten thousand soldiers and they're going to do a good job. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=428.0s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=431.0s)]
*  And I believe Canada is going to do a good job also. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=432.0s)]
*  They said the same thing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=434.0s)]
*  And then they did something much different than what you were hearing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=436.0s)]
*  This is a very, very difficult situation, but we're going to get it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=440.0s)]
*  So I don't think people should be going back to Gaza. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=445.0s)]
*  I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=447.0s)]
*  They've lived like they lived like you're living in Gaza is not a place for people to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=451.0s)]
*  be living. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=456.0s)]
*  And the only reason they want to go back and I believe this strongly is because they [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=457.0s)]
*  have no alternative. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=460.0s)]
*  What's the alternative? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=461.0s)]
*  Go where? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=462.0s)]
*  There's no other alternative. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=463.0s)]
*  If they had an alternative, they'd much rather not go back to Gaza and live in a beautiful [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=464.0s)]
*  alternative that's safe. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=469.0s)]
*  Sir, but I think it would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=470.0s)]
*  good, where they wouldn't want to return. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=475.0s)]
*  Why would they want to return? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=476.0s)]
*  The place has been one of the meanest, one of the meanest, toughest places. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=478.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=481.0s)]
*  But I think the most important thing is that they have to be able to do something that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=484.0s)]
*  is not a place for people to live in Gaza. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=488.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=490.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=492.0s)]
*  It's been one of the meanest, one of the meanest, toughest places on earth. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=495.0s)]
*  That's I can't believe a journalist said that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=500.0s)]
*  I mean, it's true. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=502.0s)]
*  I've seen every picture from every angle better than if I were there and nobody can live there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=503.0s)]
*  You can't live there. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=509.0s)]
*  So we can build, we can build them through a massive amounts of money supplied by other [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=510.0s)]
*  people, very rich nations. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=516.0s)]
*  And they'll be, they're willing to supply it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=518.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=521.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=522.0s)]
*  We're just talking about like we're talking about Palestinians. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=523.0s)]
*  Like they're just not human, you know, they just, we'll just slap them into an ugly ass [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=527.0s)]
*  Trump building in the Sinai peninsula. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=535.0s)]
*  Like someplace where they can live and not die because Gaza is a guarantee that they're [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=539.0s)]
*  going to end up dying. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=545.0s)]
*  The same thing's going to happen again. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=546.0s)]
*  It's happened over and over again. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=548.0s)]
*  And it's going to happen again as sure as you're standing there, Peter. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=550.0s)]
*  So I hope that we could do something where they wouldn't want to go back. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=554.0s)]
*  Who wouldn't want to go back? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=559.0s)]
*  They've experienced nothing but death and destruction. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=561.0s)]
*  What would you do if you were to tell them no? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=564.0s)]
*  What would you do then? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=570.0s)]
*  Well, I don't think they're going to tell me no. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=571.0s)]
*  I don't think they're going to tell me no. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=573.0s)]
*  I think they're going to tell Biden no. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=577.0s)]
*  And I think they're going to tell other people no. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=578.0s)]
*  So you think it will happen at the end? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=581.0s)]
*  I think there's a good chance. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=583.0s)]
*  How many people are you thinking about? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=584.0s)]
*  All of them. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=586.0s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about probably a million seven people, maybe a million eight. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=587.0s)]
*  But I think all of them, I think they'll be resettled in areas where they can live a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=592.0s)]
*  beautiful life and not be worried about dying every day. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=596.0s)]
*  Mr. President, do you support? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=600.0s)]
*  Mr. President, do you support building settlements, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=604.0s)]
*  Jewish settlements back in Gaza in the next years? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=609.0s)]
*  Say it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=612.0s)]
*  Building settlements, Jewish settlements back in Gaza in the next year. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=613.0s)]
*  Do you support this idea? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=616.0s)]
*  I don't see it happening. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=617.0s)]
*  It's too dangerous for people. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=618.0s)]
*  Nobody can go there. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=620.0s)]
*  It's too dangerous. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=621.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to be there. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=622.0s)]
*  Warriors don't want to be there. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=623.0s)]
*  Soldiers don't want to be there. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=625.0s)]
*  They're like, no, nobody, not even no settlements. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=626.0s)]
*  We're just going to keep that space empty. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=629.0s)]
*  It'll only be the best way to do it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=631.0s)]
*  The best way to do it is you go out and you get beautiful, open areas with the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=633.0s)]
*  sunlight coming through and that's not what I meant. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=638.0s)]
*  Something that is not going to want to go back to Gaza. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=641.0s)]
*  Prime Minister, what is your message to the families of the look at this deal that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=646.0s)]
*  worried that this deal won't go through? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=651.0s)]
*  What do you say to them at this moment? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=653.0s)]
*  Same message I said from the beginning of the war. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=654.0s)]
*  Get them out. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=657.0s)]
*  Get them back. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=658.0s)]
*  We got over 70 percent, close to 75 percent of the people who everybody believed [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=659.0s)]
*  will not get out. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=664.0s)]
*  We got them in successive deals. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=665.0s)]
*  And most recently, with the help of President Trump, we're not going to give up on [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=667.0s)]
*  our other war aims. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=670.0s)]
*  Hamas is not going to be in Gaza and we're going to get everyone back. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=672.0s)]
*  Prime Minister, how optimistic are you about reaching phase two of the ceasefire? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=677.0s)]
*  How optimistic are you about that happening? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=682.0s)]
*  Well, we're going to try. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=684.0s)]
*  That's one of the reasons, one of the things we're going to talk about here. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=685.0s)]
*  And if we, you know, when Israel and the United States work together and President [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=688.0s)]
*  Trump and I work together, you know, the chances go up a lot. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=693.0s)]
*  It's when we don't work together, Israel and the United States don't work together, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=698.0s)]
*  that creates problems. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=703.0s)]
*  When the other side sees daylight between us and occasionally in the last few years, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=704.0s)]
*  to put it mildly, they saw daylight. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=709.0s)]
*  Then it's more difficult. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=712.0s)]
*  When we cooperate, chances are good. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=714.0s)]
*  Say it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=719.0s)]
*  Now that Iran is so weak, isn't it the right time to hit their nuclear facilities once [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=720.0s)]
*  and for all? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=725.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=726.0s)]
*  I appreciate you saying that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=727.0s)]
*  They're not weak. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=729.0s)]
*  Bro, what the hell is this guy? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=730.0s)]
*  Journalists in the building are like, why can't we hit Iran's nukes? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=732.0s)]
*  You know, I signed a very strong proclamation. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=736.0s)]
*  That guy's not a journalist. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=738.0s)]
*  That's an insane person. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=740.0s)]
*  That's an insane person, dude. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=742.0s)]
*  They didn't have money for Hamas. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=744.0s)]
*  They didn't have any money for Hezbollah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=746.0s)]
*  You had no problem. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=748.0s)]
*  October 7th could have never happened. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=749.0s)]
*  When I left October 7th could have never happened. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=751.0s)]
*  And frankly, Russia and Ukraine, as I said, could never have happened. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=754.0s)]
*  They became very strong, very fast. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=758.0s)]
*  They sold massive amounts of oil to China and everybody else who would not buy the oil [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=760.0s)]
*  when I was pregnant because we said don't buy the oil. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=765.0s)]
*  And they became very rich very quickly. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=768.0s)]
*  But they're not weak. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=771.0s)]
*  They're not weak. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=772.0s)]
*  They're strong. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=773.0s)]
*  Doesn't mean they won't be weak. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=774.0s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=776.0s)]
*  We just don't want them to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=777.0s)]
*  They can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=779.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister wants you to strike Iran. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=781.0s)]
*  That's what he wants. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=785.0s)]
*  You don't know what he wants. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=787.0s)]
*  What do you know about anything? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=788.0s)]
*  But is that option on the table? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=790.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=792.0s)]
*  President Trump, is that option on the table? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=793.0s)]
*  You're not just talking about Jordan and Egypt. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=795.0s)]
*  No, it could be other places too. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=798.0s)]
*  There are many people that have reached out, many countries, many leaders of countries [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=800.0s)]
*  that have reached out that would like to participate in that. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=804.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be Jordan and Egypt, but I think it would be also them. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=807.0s)]
*  Mr. President, your relationship with Mr. Netanyahu knew ups and downs. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=811.0s)]
*  How do you describe it right now? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=818.0s)]
*  No, I think it's mostly ups. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=819.0s)]
*  Mr. President, what about the Palestinian Authority? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=821.0s)]
*  Should we rule Gaza because Gaza will be empty? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=823.0s)]
*  What? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=825.0s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=826.0s)]
*  Can it rule Gaza? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=828.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=829.0s)]
*  Well, it's had a pretty hard time, wouldn't you say? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=830.0s)]
*  I'd say it's had a pretty bad time of it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=832.0s)]
*  Mr. President, Qatar has criticized in the past as a funder of terrorism, so has the Prime Minister. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=834.0s)]
*  Do you think they're part of the solution or part of a problem moving forward? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=840.0s)]
*  I think they're trying to help. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=843.0s)]
*  Qatar is absolutely trying to help. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=844.0s)]
*  I know them very well and they're doing everything they can. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=847.0s)]
*  Very tough situation, but they're absolutely trying to help. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=851.0s)]
*  Okay, thank you very much, everybody. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=854.0s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=886.0s)]
*  I'm going to be a little bit of a [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=887.0s)]
*  demon's always winded. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=891.16s)]
*  Let's talk about systemic racism, but can apply it globally. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=900.36s)]
*  All right, let's get back to our two demons in the white house. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=903.92s)]
*  And thank you very much with your staff. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=908.96s)]
*  I'm going to introduce the first foreign head of state to visit during our administration. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=913.48s)]
*  And Bibi, I want to say it's an honor to have you with us. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=916.52s)]
*  Over the past four years, the U.S. and the Israeli alliance has been tested more than [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=922.0s)]
*  any time in history. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=928.28s)]
*  But the bonds of friendship and affection between the American and Israeli people have [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=931.6s)]
*  endured for generations, and they are absolutely unbreakable. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=936.4s)]
*  They are unbreakable. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=940.2s)]
*  I'm confident that under our leadership, the cherished alliance between our two countries [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=942.6800000000001s)]
*  will soon be stronger than ever before. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=947.5600000000001s)]
*  Unbreakable. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=949.6s)]
*  We had a great relationship. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=950.6s)]
*  We had great victories together four years ago. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=951.6s)]
*  Not so many victories over the past four years, however. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=955.24s)]
*  In my first term, Prime Minister and I forged a tremendously successful partnership that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=959.08s)]
*  brought peace and stability to the Middle East like it hadn't seen in decades. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=964.48s)]
*  After we defeated ISIS, we ended the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, one of the worst deals [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=971.16s)]
*  ever made, by the way, and imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=975.84s)]
*  We starved Hamas and Iran's other terrorist proxies, and we starved them like they had [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=982.6s)]
*  never seen before. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=989.64s)]
*  Resources and support disappeared for them. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=990.92s)]
*  I recognized Israel's capital, opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and got it [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=994.72s)]
*  built, by the way. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1000.26s)]
*  Built it, too. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1001.26s)]
*  Just not only designated it, but got it built at a price that nobody's seen for 40 years. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1002.26s)]
*  We got all Jerusalem stone right from nearby, and it's something that's very special. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1010.06s)]
*  And recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something that they talked [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1016.3s)]
*  about for 70 years, and they weren't able to get it, and I got it. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1022.02s)]
*  And with the historic Abraham, it's something that was really... [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1027.26s)]
*  an achievement that was, I think, going to become more and more important because we [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1031.18s)]
*  achieved the most significant Middle East peace agreements in half a century, but the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1036.14s)]
*  Abraham Accords in particular. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1041.38s)]
*  And I really believe that many countries will soon be joining this amazing peace and economic [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1043.38s)]
*  development transaction. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1048.82s)]
*  It really is a big economic development transaction. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1050.46s)]
*  I think we're going to have a lot of people signing up very quickly. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1055.14s)]
*  Unfortunately, for four years, nobody signed up. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1057.66s)]
*  Nobody did anything for four years except in the negative. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1060.98s)]
*  Unfortunately, the weakness and incompetence of those years, those past four years, the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1063.98s)]
*  grave damage around the globe that was done, including in the Middle East, grave damage [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1069.82s)]
*  all over the globe. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  The horrors of October 7th would never have happened if I were president. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1077.4599999999998s)]
*  The Ukraine and Russia disaster would never have happened if I were president. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1083.1s)]
*  Over the past 16 months, Israel has endured a sustained, aggressive, and murderous assault [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1089.24s)]
*  on every front, but they fought back bravely. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1095.2s)]
*  You see that and you know that. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1098.0800000000002s)]
*  What we have witnessed is an all-out attack on the very existence of a Jewish state in [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1099.48s)]
*  the Jewish homeland. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1105.88s)]
*  The Israelis have stood strong and united in the face of an enemy that has kidnapped, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1108.04s)]
*  tortured, raped, and slaughtered innocent men, women, children, and even little babies. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1113.72s)]
*  I want to salute the Israeli people for meeting with courage and determination and unflinching [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1120.52s)]
*  resolve. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1127.6000000000001s)]
*  They have been strong. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  In our meetings today, the Prime Minister and I focused on the future, discussing how [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1130.88s)]
*  we can work together to ensure Hamas is eliminated and ultimately restore peace to a very troubled [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1135.6000000000001s)]

*  It's been troubled, but what's happened in the last four years has not been good. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1144.04s)]
*  I want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for working closely with my transition team, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1149.48s)]

*  It's right now a demolition site. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1312.02s)]
*  This is just a demolition site. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1313.66s)]
*  Virtually every building is down. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1315.7s)]

*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1340.5s)]

*  Do something different. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1362.76s)]
*  Just can't go back. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1363.76s)]

*  I'm hopeful that this ceasefire could be the beginning of a larger and more enduring [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1369.36s)]
*  peace that will end the bloodshed and killing once and for all. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1373.8799999999999s)]
*  With the same goal in mind, my administration has been moving quickly to restore trust in [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1378.2s)]
*  the alliance and rebuild American strength throughout the region. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1383.24s)]
*  And we've really done that. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1387.04s)]
*  We're a respected nation again. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1388.2s)]
*  Lots happened in the last couple of weeks. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1390.76s)]
*  We are actually a very respected nation again. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1392.68s)]
*  I ended the last administration's de facto arms embargo on over $1 billion in military [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1397.1200000000001s)]
*  assistance for Israel. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1403.44s)]
*  And I'm also pleased to announce that this afternoon the United States withdrew from [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1405.76s)]
*  the anti-Semitic UN Human Rights Council and ended all of the support for the UN Relief [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1409.72s)]

*  Today I also took action to restore a maximum pressure policy on the Iranian regime. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1422.0800000000002s)]
*  And we will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions, drive Iranian oil exports [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1428.0400000000002s)]

*  the world. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1439.52s)]
*  We had no threat when I left office. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1441.3600000000001s)]
*  Iran was not able to sell oil. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1445.2s)]
*  Nobody was buying oil because I said, don't buy it. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1450.44s)]
*  If you buy it, you're not doing any business with the United States. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1452.84s)]
*  And Hamas was not being funded. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1455.84s)]
*  Hezbollah was not being funded. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1457.44s)]
*  Nobody was being funded. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1460.12s)]
*  There would never have been an October 7th. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1461.12s)]
*  Two weeks ago I once again designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization trying [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1464.28s)]
*  to destroy world shipping lanes, and that's not going to happen. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1470.8s)]
*  And over the weekend I ordered airstrikes against senior ISIS leaders hiding in the [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1475.6399999999999s)]

*  Here in America we've begun the process of deporting foreign terrorists, jihadists, and [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1483.56s)]
*  Hamas sympathizers from our soil, just as we have people that are extremely evil and [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1487.9199999999998s)]
*  we're sending them out of our country. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1495.8s)]

*  They came from mental institutions and insane asylums, and they were dumped into our country. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1498.94s)]
*  They're gang members. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1503.5s)]
*  We're getting them out at numbers that nobody can actually believe. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1504.5s)]
*  And every single country is taking those people back. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1509.78s)]
*  They said they would never take them back, and they're all taking them back, and they're [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1513.5800000000002s)]

*  Together America and Israel will renew the optimism that shines so brightly just four [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1529.8s)]
*  years ago. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1534.42s)]
*  It was really a bright, beautiful light. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1535.42s)]
*  We will restore calm and stability to the region and expand prosperity, opportunity, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1538.44s)]

*  I'll say it again. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1591.48s)]
*  You are the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1593.1s)]
*  And that's why the people of Israel have such enormous respect for you. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1599.72s)]
*  In your first term, you recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1607.8799999999999s)]
*  You moved the American embassy there. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1612.8799999999999s)]
*  You recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1615.4199999999998s)]
*  You withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1618.82s)]
*  I remember we spoke about it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1622.1799999999998s)]

*  with four Arab states. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1645.3s)]

*  You ended unjust sanctions against law-abiding Israeli citizens. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1687.42s)]
*  You boldly confronted the scourge of anti-Semitism. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1691.82s)]
*  You stopped funding, as you just said, international organizations like UNRWA that support and [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1697.06s)]
*  fund our efforts. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=1703.62s)]

*  territory. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2249.56s)]
*  What authority would allow you to do that? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2250.56s)]
*  Are you talking about a permanent occupation there, redevelopment? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2252.56s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, do you see this idea as a way to expand the boundaries of Israel and [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2258.04s)]
*  to have a longer peace? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2263.04s)]
*  How can you stay same while listening to this? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2265.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2268.04s)]
*  I just expect the worst from the start. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2271.04s)]
*  It allows me to be more composed. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2276.04s)]
*  I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2279.04s)]
*  part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2284.52s)]
*  And everybody I've spoken to, this was not a decision made lightly. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2287.52s)]
*  Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2291.52s)]
*  developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent in [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2296.52s)]
*  a really magnificent area that nobody would know. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2301.52s)]
*  Nobody can look because all they see is death and destruction and rubble and demolished [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2304.52s)]
*  buildings falling all over. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2310.52s)]
*  It's a terrible sight. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2313.0s)]
*  I've studied it very closely over a lot of months, and I've seen it from every different [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2315.0s)]
*  angle. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2322.0s)]
*  And it's a very, very dangerous place to be. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2323.0s)]
*  And it's only going to get worse. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2325.0s)]
*  And I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous and I'm talking about from the [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2328.0s)]
*  highest level of leadership, gotten tremendous praise. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2333.0s)]
*  And if the United States can help to bring stability and peace in the Middle East, we'll [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2336.0s)]
*  do that. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2341.0s)]
*  I mentioned again tonight our three goals. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2342.48s)]
*  The third goal is to make sure that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2349.48s)]
*  President Trump is taking it to a much higher level. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2354.48s)]
*  He sees a different future for that piece of land that has been the focus of so much [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2358.48s)]
*  terrorism, so many attacks against us, so many trials and so many tribulations. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2365.96s)]
*  He has a different idea. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2374.96s)]
*  And I think it's worth paying attention to this. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2376.96s)]
*  We're talking about it. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2379.96s)]
*  He's exploring it with his people, with his staff. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2381.96s)]
*  I think it's something that could change history. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2384.96s)]
*  And it's worthwhile really pursuing this avenue. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2387.96s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2391.96s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2394.44s)]
*  We're working very hard to get all the hostages. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2416.44s)]
*  America First out the window? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2418.44s)]
*  Chatter. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2420.44s)]
*  There was never an America First principle. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2421.44s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2423.92s)]
*  Even the terrorists themselves don't actually yield America First principles at all. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2424.92s)]
*  America First is just pure marketing so that you can put profits first. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2427.92s)]
*  You can put war first. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2433.92s)]
*  You can put profiteers that want to rebuild Gaza first and then the real estate developers [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2435.4s)]
*  that come in afterwards. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2439.64s)]
*  If we don't, it will just capitalism first, always and forever. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2440.64s)]
*  Somewhat more violent. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2444.84s)]
*  I will tell you that because they would have broken their word. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2445.84s)]
*  Mr. Witkoff and his entire group have been working 24 hours around the clock and they [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2449.16s)]
*  want them out and promises have been made to them. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2455.92s)]
*  And we'll see whether or not those promises will be kept. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2459.72s)]
*  But we want all the hostages. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2462.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2463.92s)]
*  How much time do you think it will take? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2464.92s)]
*  Mr. President, do you support Israeli sovereignty in the Anseimaria areas which many believe [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2465.92s)]
*  is the biblical homeland of the Jewish people? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2474.92s)]
*  That's a great question, man. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2476.92s)]
*  Many of your representatives, you represented very well and people do like the idea but [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2479.6800000000003s)]
*  we haven't taken a position on it yet. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2485.48s)]
*  But we will be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2488.2400000000002s)]
*  four weeks. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2494.62s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2495.62s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2496.62s)]
*  You just said that you think all the Palestinians should be relocated to other countries. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2498.3199999999997s)]
*  Does that mean that you do not support a two-state solution? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2511.3199999999997s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one state or any other state. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2515.94s)]
*  It means that we want to have, we want to give people a chance at life. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2520.54s)]
*  They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole for people [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2524.7799999999997s)]
*  living there. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2529.7s)]
*  It's been horrible. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2530.7s)]
*  The Hamas has made it so bad, so bad, so dangerous, so unfair to people. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2531.7s)]
*  And by doing what I'm recommending that we do, it's a very strong recommendation, but [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2539.3999999999996s)]
*  it is a strong recommendation. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2543.9399999999996s)]
*  By doing that, we think we're going to bring perhaps great peace to long beyond this area. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2545.62s)]
*  I have to stress this is not for Israel. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2552.2200000000003s)]
*  This is for everybody in the Middle East, Arabs, Muslims. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2554.96s)]
*  This is for everybody. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2557.86s)]
*  This would be where they can partake in terms of jobs and living and all of the other benefits. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2558.86s)]
*  And I think it's very important. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2565.3s)]
*  It just doesn't work the other way. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2566.54s)]
*  You can't keep trying. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2568.64s)]
*  They just, as you've been going along for so many decades, you can't even count. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2569.86s)]
*  You just can't keep doing. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2574.7s)]
*  You have to learn from history. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2575.7s)]
*  You can't keep doing the same mistake over and over again. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2577.74s)]
*  Gaza is a hellhole right now. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2581.74s)]
*  It was before the bombing started, frankly. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2584.04s)]
*  And we're going to give people a chance to live in a beautiful community that's safe [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2587.04s)]
*  and secure. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2591.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think you're going to see tremendous, a tremendous outflowing of support. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2592.86s)]
*  I can tell you I spoke to other leaders of countries in the Middle East, and they love [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2598.54s)]
*  the idea. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2603.38s)]
*  It would really bring stability, and what we need is stability. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2604.38s)]
*  Yes, sir, please. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2607.38s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2608.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2609.38s)]
*  Are you still committed to imposing sanctions on the ICC despite the move being stalled [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2610.38s)]
*  in the Senate? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2618.46s)]
*  And please, a question for the Prime Minister as well. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2619.46s)]
*  The President has been very clear about his desire to achieve a deal with Saudi Arabia. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2621.9s)]
*  How do you settle this if Israel is required to renew the war against Hamas in the future? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2626.62s)]
*  That's literally Channel 14. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2632.42s)]
*  That's Benjamin and Yahoo's channel. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2633.82s)]
*  I think everybody understands that just as the President fought and defeated al-Qaeda [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2635.94s)]
*  and ISIS, that we can't leave Hamas there because Hamas will continue the battle to [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2642.7000000000003s)]
*  destroy Israel. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2648.7400000000002s)]
*  They'll do, you know, in this temporary ceasefire, one of their leaders comes out, you know what [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2649.7400000000002s)]
*  he says? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2656.1000000000004s)]
*  We're going to do October 7th again, except we'll do it bigger. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2657.1000000000004s)]
*  So obviously, you can't talk about peace neither with Hamas or in the Middle East if this toxic, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2663.1s)]
*  murderous organization is left standing. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2672.42s)]
*  Anymore that you could make peace in Europe after World War II if the Nazi regime was [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2675.46s)]
*  left standing and the Nazi army was left standing. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2680.62s)]
*  That did happen, by the way. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2684.2999999999997s)]
*  But you guys are also closer to the Nazis in this situation. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2686.46s)]
*  Israel is the Nazis in this equation for the record. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2689.82s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2694.82s)]
*  Not only did the United States of America do that already. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2702.1000000000004s)]
*  Do you have any plan to change Afghanistan situation? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2705.9s)]
*  Are you able to recognize Taliban? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2708.82s)]
*  Because I'm an Afghan journalist, Afghan support woman. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2711.6200000000003s)]
*  Any comment about Afghanistan? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2715.02s)]
*  What's your future plan for Afghan people, especially Afghan people? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2716.6200000000003s)]
*  I have a little hard time understanding you. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2719.62s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2722.02s)]
*  Actually, it's a beautiful voice and a beautiful accent. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2724.02s)]
*  The only problem is I can't understand a word you're saying. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2729.14s)]
*  But I just say this. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2732.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2733.98s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2734.98s)]
*  Live in peace. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2735.98s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2736.98s)]

*  be able to make a great deal, a deal where you can get on with your lives and you'll [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2803.98s)]

*  I know them well. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2820.9s)]

*  very proud of Iran. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2826.94s)]
*  But I hated to do it, just so you understand. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2828.98s)]
*  And I hope we're going to be able to do something so that it doesn't end up in a very catastrophic [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2832.06s)]

*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2845.2400000000002s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2846.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm not putting restrictions. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2848.02s)]
*  They cannot have one thing. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2850.2999999999997s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2852.8999999999996s)]
*  And if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, despite what I just said, I think [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2854.8199999999997s)]
*  that's going to be very unfortunate for them. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2860.4199999999996s)]
*  If on the other hand, they can convince us that they won't, and I hope they can. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2862.7s)]
*  It's very easy to do. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2866.4199999999996s)]
*  It's actually very easy to do. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2867.4199999999996s)]
*  I think they're going to have an unbelievable future. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2869.66s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2871.9399999999996s)]

*  Go ahead. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2873.94s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2874.94s)]
*  You just laid out your plan for Gaza. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2875.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2878.94s)]
*  Can you lay out your plan for Ukraine? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2879.94s)]
*  And also... [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2882.5s)]
*  For Ukraine? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2883.5s)]
*  For Ukraine, yes. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2884.5s)]
*  You consider yourself a strong leader. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2885.5s)]
*  You blamed your predecessor for letting Russia to take over Ukraine. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2888.58s)]
*  Will you demand from Putin to get out of Ukraine, from the sovereign territory of Ukraine? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2894.02s)]
*  So we're dealing right now on the subject. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2899.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't want to spend a lot of time because we're here for another reason. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2901.82s)]
*  But we are having very good talks, very constructive talks on Ukraine. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2904.26s)]
*  We are talking to the Russians. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2909.5s)]
*  We're talking to the Ukrainian leadership. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2911.7400000000002s)]
*  It would have never happened. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2915.2200000000003s)]
*  That would have never happened. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2916.5600000000004s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2917.6200000000003s)]
*  I get reports every week the number of soldiers, mostly soldiers now, the cities have been [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2919.5s)]
*  largely demolished. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2924.2200000000003s)]
*  You talk about a very sad sight to see. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2926.1800000000003s)]
*  We talk Gaza. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2930.2200000000003s)]
*  Many of these cities look as bad as Gaza and worse, what's happened to them. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2931.66s)]
*  And I want to see that end. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2937.1s)]
*  And I want to see it end for one simple reason, the life of young people being absolutely [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2938.8999999999996s)]
*  obliterated on both sides. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2944.22s)]
*  You probably have 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead, 800,000 maybe more Russian soldiers [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2945.8599999999997s)]
*  dead. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2952.3799999999997s)]
*  It's very flat land. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2954.1s)]
*  And the only thing that's going to stop a bullet is a human body. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2955.2999999999997s)]
*  In this case, usually soldiers and the numbers are staggering when you hear the real numbers [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2959.42s)]
*  in Ukraine, what the numbers are. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2964.28s)]
*  And this doesn't include the cities that have been demolished and all of the people that [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2966.88s)]
*  were killed. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2970.32s)]
*  So I want to see it stopped. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2972.2000000000003s)]
*  Talking about Ukraine in this way, immediately after, even though Trump does exercise a level [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2974.2400000000002s)]
*  of empathy towards Russia that definitely doesn't exist for the Palestinians, is such [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2980.1200000000003s)]
*  an obvious, glaringly obvious hypocrisy. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2988.52s)]
*  And we have to just be like, Oh, it's really, it's really devastating for Ukrainian cities. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2992.48s)]
*  Like meanwhile, it's just like, it is a human tragedy and we're going to try very hard to [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=2997.8s)]
*  stop it. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3003.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3004.12s)]
*  Is he going to tell, is he going to tell the Ukrainians to move actually with Donald Trump? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3005.12s)]
*  I don't even want to know the answer to that. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3010.2s)]
*  To be honest, he's going to be like, yeah, well, you know, we just got to let, we just [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3011.72s)]
*  got to get 30 million Ukrainians to move. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3016.08s)]
*  They're all Slavic anyway. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3018.72s)]
*  They can go to Poland. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3020.84s)]
*  They are already in Poland. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3023.24s)]
*  They could go to Poland. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3024.74s)]
*  The more I talk about it, the more I'm thinking, maybe he will say that. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3026.44s)]
*  So obviously let's not, you know, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3029.96s)]
*  we fully agree with that. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3035.08s)]
*  If Russians are the Israelis and Ukrainians are the Palestinians in this situation. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3041.88s)]
*  So be it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3045.0s)]
*  No, I know that I'm saying he's going to focus. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3046.12s)]
*  At first I was going to say demonstrates this like glaringly obvious hypocrisy where he [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3049.88s)]
*  understands the humanity of the Ukrainians, but it's Donald Trump. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3053.24s)]
*  So he doesn't really understand that either. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3055.7599999999998s)]
*  So in some ways it's not, you know, anyway, let's just, it's a, it's a campaign of pressure [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3057.24s)]
*  to see if we can get something done. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3064.2s)]
*  He doesn't want to do what some people think will automatically happen because they're [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3067.44s)]
*  very difficult people to deal with, as you know. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3070.96s)]
*  But if we could solve this problem without warfare, without all of the things that you've [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3075.08s)]
*  been witnessing over the last number of years, it would be, I think it would be a tremendous [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3081.24s)]
*  thing. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3085.44s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3086.44s)]
*  Do you have any plans to visit Israel? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3087.76s)]
*  To visit where? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3094.28s)]
*  Oh, well, I love, I love Israel. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3095.28s)]
*  I will visit there and I'll [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3098.64s)]
*  The same as Israelis. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3099.92s)]
*  Are you insane? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3101.28s)]
*  And I'll visit. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3103.04s)]
*  It's reductive, but in this dynamic, the Russian state's actions in Ukraine are quite similar [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3104.04s)]

*  no, there is definitely a lot more similarities with Russian action in Ukraine to Israeli [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3130.7999999999997s)]

*  because this way you push the Palestinians in the Egypt and Jordan and then a couple [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3282.56s)]
*  and then a decade later, you can also invade Egypt and Jordan. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3287.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, saying security, security threats exist this, this way Israel can maintain its [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3293.12s)]

*  In the simplest terms, Mohammed bin Salman, the king of Saudi Arabia, crown prince of [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3393.28s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has long maintained the position that he considers the Palestinian plight as [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3398.52s)]
*  a, as a nuisance. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3403.92s)]

*  I just pray the world doesn't look away. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3566.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know what the world is capable of doing. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3568.48s)]
*  If America has his heart set on permanent occupation and permanent death and destruction [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3570.84s)]
*  in the region, I truly don't know. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3576.48s)]
*  That's the other side of this process. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3580.96s)]
*  The only, the only country that can save us is China and China has his own allegiances [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3583.08s)]
*  with Israel as I've mentioned time and time again. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3587.32s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3590.12s)]
*  It is very, it is incredibly bleak. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3593.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to lie to you. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3595.52s)]
*  Building off of what Trump came out and said in his opening statement that built off of [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3596.52s)]
*  what he had been saying all day long, even before the Israeli prime minister arrived [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3600.64s)]
*  here at the white house, which was talking about Palestinians leaving Gaza while it is [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3604.8s)]
*  being rebuilt. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3609.8s)]
*  He has now suggested twice that Egypt and Jordan could take them. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3610.84s)]
*  Both of those countries have outright rejected any notion of that happening. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3614.6800000000003s)]
*  And I should note the king of Jordan will be visiting here next week as the president [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3619.2000000000003s)]
*  was just referencing to me there when he was answering my question and looking at this [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3622.2400000000002s)]
*  in terms of what this looks like going forward and how the United States would take ownership [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3626.9s)]
*  of the U.S. Gaza. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3632.7200000000003s)]
*  He left open the idea that American forces could be involved in that. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3633.84s)]
*  But the real crux of that question is where the Palestinians are supposed to go. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3637.96s)]
*  There are over a million people living in that enclave. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3642.36s)]
*  And while the president is talking about what it looks like now and how destroyed it has [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3645.6800000000003s)]
*  been since this war started 16 months ago, that is the question here, because obviously [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3649.08s)]
*  this is an area that is rife with tension and incredibly sensitive. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3654.36s)]
*  And what that could look like is a massive question here of what could happen next. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3658.52s)]
*  And so the president, they're unable to say where he thinks the Palestinians should go [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3664.0s)]
*  after this, where they would go while Gaza is being rebuilt. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3668.64s)]
*  He said that they could potentially return to Gaza after that happened. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3671.92s)]
*  That was the first time that he had suggested that all day long. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3676.36s)]
*  And obviously is a key question. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3679.36s)]
*  It is their homeland. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3681.04s)]
*  It is where the Palestinians live right now. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3682.04s)]
*  And so the question, not just of who is in charge of the Gaza Strip after it would be [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3684.76s)]
*  rebuilt, but clearly you heard the president there essentially viewing this through a [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3688.8s)]
*  real estate lens, saying it could be the Riviera of the Middle East as he was articulating [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3693.4s)]
*  what this could look like in terms of who lives there and who is in control of it. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3698.52s)]
*  That has created a ton of questions. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3704.1600000000003s)]
*  What does this mean for the future of the ceasefire tonight, Erin? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3705.84s)]
*  I think that hangs in the balance because there was already a question when the prime [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3708.44s)]
*  minister was arriving here of how that second phase would be carried out and what exactly [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3711.76s)]
*  that would look like. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3717.1600000000003s)]
*  Now the question is whether or not Hamas still abides by this ceasefire as they are hearing [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3718.48s)]
*  the American president say that the US is going to take over the land and which Hamas [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3722.96s)]
*  lives now. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3728.1600000000003s)]
*  And of course, many of these Palestinian civilians who have been fleeing this war and already [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3729.1600000000003s)]
*  displaced from their homes. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3734.0s)]
*  And now the US president is suggesting that they could permanently. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3735.76s)]
*  Do you think Saudi Arabia and Sydney Arab states will accept will see to us is really [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3738.76s)]
*  demands for passing displacement to refugee camps and neighboring countries. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3743.2400000000002s)]
*  The forcible displacement of 1 million, 1.8 million is genocide. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3746.4s)]
*  There's no room for ambiguity or plausible deniability whatsoever is so fucked man. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3749.44s)]
*  Yeah, but don't you understand? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3753.04s)]
*  He wants to build a Riviera. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3754.84s)]
*  They're not even hiding it. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3757.28s)]
*  Like they're openly just stating mass ethnic displacement of 1.8 million Palestinians indigenous [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3758.36s)]
*  to the land that have already been displaced once to go to the Gaza Strip out of the Gaza [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3765.4s)]
*  Strip. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3770.6s)]
*  It is unambiguously ethnic cleansing. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3780.4s)]
*  How, what even would be the reaction within Israel to hear the president of the United [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3784.84s)]
*  States saying what he just said? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3789.84s)]
*  CNN's framing of it is wrong. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3791.1600000000003s)]
*  We need to be really clear about what we had just heard from the president of the United [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3795.28s)]
*  States. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3798.92s)]
*  CNN's framing of this is wrong. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3799.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3801.56s)]
*  They're doing state department. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3802.56s)]
*  They're, they're running defense for the state department claiming, Oh no, they'll be able [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3803.56s)]
*  to go back once it's rebuilt. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3807.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3809.12s)]
*  They can stay there while it's being rebuilt then. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3810.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3812.16s)]
*  That's it. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3813.16s)]
*  They're there right now. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3814.16s)]
*  They're living in the fucking rubble. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3815.16s)]
*  Move them into Israel. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3817.16s)]
*  If you want, if you want a guaranteed return to the Gaza Strip, then you got to move them [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3818.16s)]
*  into Israel. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3821.96s)]
*  That's the reality. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3822.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3823.96s)]
*  Because if there was one group of people that definitely would be tasked with rebuilding [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3824.96s)]
*  Gaza ASAP, it would be Israelis. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3828.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3832.2s)]
*  It's actually mind boggling how in the same sentence, CNN just said it is now a question [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3833.2s)]
*  of whether Hamas abide by the ceasefire after Hamas said the U S will take over Gaza. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3838.32s)]
*  Am I going insane? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3841.92s)]
*  Did I hear that wrong? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3842.92s)]
*  No, you're not going insane. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3843.92s)]
*  I think, I think the, this is, it's actually when you realize that the people that we are [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3846.2400000000002s)]
*  talking about, at least in mainstream outlets are not seen as real human beings. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3856.0s)]
*  clear how this kind of propaganda can happen. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3864.5s)]
*  Palestinians are not considered to be real human beings. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3869.06s)]
*  They're not considered to be human at all. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3871.22s)]
*  So obviously how to deal with them can be talked about in these ways. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3873.4s)]
*  There's no other group of people that you could talk like this about across the board. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3880.74s)]
*  That's it. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3888.22s)]
*  We'll talk to someone who will talk about how they still have the keys to their family's [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3890.22s)]
*  home in Ashkelon, which is on obviously the Israeli side, who are Palestinians. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3893.5s)]
*  To imagine the people who live in Gaza are just going to happily merrily go live in some [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3898.02s)]
*  kind of a permanent refugee camp like Syrians have been living in. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3901.98s)]
*  Okay, great. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3904.7799999999997s)]
*  They're anti Trump. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3905.7799999999997s)]
*  So they'll finally cover it truthfully. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3906.7799999999997s)]
*  The only reason to go back is if they have nowhere else to go. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3908.5s)]
*  Jim, of course, that's not the reason they want to go back. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3911.66s)]
*  They want to go back because it's home. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3915.22s)]
*  So then what does all this actually mean? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3917.18s)]
*  Does this all just become a whole lot of hot air or not? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3919.02s)]
*  Well, listen, apply that principle to any other war or conflict that involves two people [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3921.82s)]
*  fighting over a piece of land. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3928.18s)]
*  Did George Mitchell suggest moving the Catholics out of Ireland? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3930.82s)]
*  When you were speaking about South Africa, did you discuss moving all black South Africans [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3935.58s)]
*  out of Africa to solve the issue here? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3940.5s)]
*  It's preposterous and it's illegal by any understanding of international law that you [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3944.5s)]
*  would forcibly move people away from their homes. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3949.54s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3952.66s)]
*  The agency here, right, is the agency of the Palestinian people. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3953.66s)]
*  Are they going to be frog marched out of their country by US forces as it's then rebuilt [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3956.74s)]
*  as a as a Riviera by presumably US property developers? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3961.58s)]
*  That seems to be what the president. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3967.18s)]
*  It's not seem to be what the president is suggesting. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3969.02s)]
*  It is what the president is suggesting in so many words. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3971.12s)]
*  And I would just say that the thing is with Trump, he seems to be applying this principle, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3974.0s)]
*  if you want to call it that, to other places as well. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3979.78s)]
*  He wants Greenland apply pressure to an ally in this case, a treaty ally, Denmark, and [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3982.24s)]
*  take ownership, maybe send some money their way and make it part of the US. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3988.28s)]
*  Same with Panama. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3993.68s)]
*  Violate a decades old treaty to take back the Panama Canal. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3994.68s)]
*  There is the agency of the nations whose territory is sovereign, right? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=3999.52s)]
*  Much like the Palestinian people in Gaza. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4004.98s)]
*  It seems to be a Trump worldview here that requires moving people off their land. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4007.74s)]
*  The other piece I would say it requires two other countries giving up their land, right? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4015.18s)]
*  Jordan and Egypt to become new homes for the Palestinian people. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4020.06s)]
*  And by the way, their leaders have said they have no interest in doing that. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4023.78s)]
*  And of course it was also. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4026.48s)]
*  It's not about the leaders, man. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4027.48s)]
*  It's not about the leaders of Jordan and the leaders of Saudi Arabia. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4028.78s)]
*  It's never about them. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4032.88s)]
*  It's never been about them. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4033.88s)]
*  It's entirely about the Palestinians. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4035.46s)]
*  And the more we sidestep Palestinians from this conversation, the more October 7 and [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4038.7200000000003s)]
*  the conditions for October 7 get primed up. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4043.82s)]
*  All of this and watching the look on prime minister Netanyahu's face, I was struck Jeremy [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4049.26s)]
*  by the fact that even he. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4055.38s)]
*  I don't want to use the word giddy, but in a sense, that's the right word. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4058.18s)]
*  So much for the protest vote against Kamala just made it worse. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4060.54s)]
*  This is so, this is such a stupid attitude to have because one, there's no inclination [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4063.58s)]
*  that Kamala Harris was going was, I mean, there's the only thing that we knew about [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4069.18s)]
*  Kamala Harris was that she was literally doing the same exact thing that Joe Biden was doing, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4073.86s)]
*  even if it actually harmed her electoral chances. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4078.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4081.46s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4082.46s)]
*  And number two, I maintain the position that Donald Trump was going to be worse than Kamala [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4083.46s)]
*  Harris. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4087.98s)]
*  You're coming to someone who literally openly recognize that this was going to happen. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4088.98s)]
*  I warned of this happening. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4093.58s)]
*  And at the time Kamala Harris, or at least any liberal that wanted to win could have [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4095.4s)]
*  been like, yeah, we're going to actually put an end to this. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4098.66s)]
*  We're going to put a stop to what Joe Biden is doing. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4100.74s)]
*  And they chose not to. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4102.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4104.74s)]
*  So saying that like, Oh, so much for the protest vote, especially when Kamala Harris lost by [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4106.12s)]
*  wider margins than the people that voted for someone else is just idiotic. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4110.5s)]
*  I don't know why liberals often repeat this false notion. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4117.1s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4122.58s)]
*  Kamala Harris lost by wider margins than the protest voters that voted for Jill Stein. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4124.18s)]
*  Even if you were to combine all of the protest voters, okay. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4132.780000000001s)]
*  Even if it is, even if it is combined exactly preach them a song on how shit it is to mock [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4142.46s)]
*  the Gaza voters. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4149.34s)]
*  Those voters made a rational decision based on what Biden and Harris did, especially if [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4150.34s)]
*  they assume she was going to lose already, which she was fucking going to do. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4153.82s)]
*  I can't believe H Bizzala saying this. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4157.34s)]
*  I don't know if you're saying this sarcastically or not. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4158.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4161.86s)]
*  We got the UAW. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4163.12s)]
*  We got the DNC's very own H Bizzle even fucking a chirping right now. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4164.46s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4169.34s)]
*  It's true by the way. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4170.82s)]
*  I mean, you're 100% correct. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4174.900000000001s)]
*  H Bizzle. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4176.3s)]
*  This is it. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4177.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris looked at the electoral map. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4178.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4182.42s)]
*  She looked at the electoral map, recognizing the dangers of a Trump administration and was [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4183.42s)]
*  woefully incompetent in addressing any of the needs that the American public wanted. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4189.42s)]
*  So no, especially considering that she lost margins than even the protest votes combined. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4197.42s)]
*  This is an insane statement to advance. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4204.9400000000005s)]
*  Regardless of the hypothetical reality where Kamala Harris would not be as bad as Donald [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4209.34s)]
*  Trump, which we have no proof for. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4216.14s)]
*  And even then I still maintain that position throughout the entire process. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4218.22s)]
*  I told you that Donald Trump was going to do exactly this shit over and over and over [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4223.3s)]
*  and over again. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4228.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4231.3s)]
*  Liberals just go with whatever narrative makes them feel morally superior. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4239.3s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's just like, what is insane to me? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4242.34s)]
*  What is completely and utterly insane to me about all of this is that liberals just choose [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4248.82s)]
*  not to learn any lessons from their failures at all and just want to go back to business [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4258.04s)]
*  as usual politics. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4265.04s)]
*  Now they and the party can get away with doing that, but you as a voter shouldn't be doing [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4266.04s)]
*  propaganda for an incompetent party when they're incompetent has led to Donald Trump's victory. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4275.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4281.34s)]
*  You are a voter. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4282.34s)]
*  You're not a democratic party consultant. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4283.34s)]
*  So why are you running defense for their ineptitude? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4285.46s)]
*  Why are you rewarding them for their ineptitude? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4289.22s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4293.14s)]
*  This is the second time that the liberals have lost to Donald Trump. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4295.86s)]
*  My, hi, my name is Julia. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4301.02s)]

*  The Biden facility to genocide in Gaza, but now the Trump is an office. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4308.34s)]
*  I suddenly want to act like I care about ethnic cleansing in Gaza. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4310.740000000001s)]
*  I'm doing it solely to score political points because I'm a proud partisan, genocidal ghoul. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4313.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4317.06s)]
*  I hope everyone's happy now that they got genocide. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4318.06s)]
*  Joe out of office. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4319.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4320.660000000001s)]
*  They went from genocide Joe to genocide Trump. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4321.660000000001s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4322.660000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't even just, and it wasn't even just about Gaza. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4328.54s)]
*  Gaza was a key component of the electoral defeat. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4332.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4335.46s)]
*  For the, for, for Kamala Harris, especially in Michigan, sending Richie Torres, sending [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4336.46s)]
*  Bill Clinton out there doing all this shit was obviously a, a, a unimaginably stupid [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4341.38s)]
*  decision. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4349.7s)]
*  And I know that it was an unimaginably, unimaginably stupid decision because I was there while [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4350.7s)]
*  it was happening. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4354.98s)]
*  And I kept going, why are they doing this? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4356.14s)]
*  Why are they doing this? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4358.46s)]
*  One thing that I must remind people, okay. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4361.58s)]
*  Is that even beyond Gaza, the Kamala Harris campaign was so unimaginably inept, so unqualified [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4365.94s)]
*  to meet the needs of the American public that they lost the reason why they lost by incredibly [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4374.54s)]
*  wide margins that you couldn't even make up for the fucking protest votes. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4381.22s)]
*  If all of them combined, the reason why Kamala Harris lost to the couch and the reason why [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4386.58s)]
*  Kamala Harris lost to people who were just more enthusiastic about voting for Donald [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4390.82s)]
*  Trump was because they did not address the needs. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4394.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4402.94s)]
*  Gaza was a big factor in this, but they, but Gaza, technically in terms of the democratic [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4403.94s)]
*  parties, woeful incompetence and their inability to see the electoral map for what it actually [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4411.7s)]
*  was is a mere demonstration of their, their attitude across a broad spectrum of issues. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4418.5s)]
*  This problem is at the heart of the democratic party. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4428.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4433.42s)]
*  It's not just Gaza directly, even though Gaza directly played a formative role in this, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4434.42s)]
*  but it's more so the attitude that they demonstrated in Gaza in not dealing with these problems [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4439.38s)]
*  that we were causing that our administration was responsible for. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4445.46s)]
*  It actually can translate that blindness can actually translate to every other issue, whether [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4449.5s)]
*  it be protection for marginalized people, whether it be fucking healthcare, whether [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4455.66s)]
*  it be labor protection, or even defending some of the good things that the administration [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4459.3s)]
*  had done defending its own successes. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4464.86s)]
*  Every part of this process was fundamentally busted. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4470.14s)]
*  And the proof is in the results. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4477.5s)]
*  The proof is in the results of this election. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4479.58s)]
*  It's that simple. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4481.38s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4483.7s)]
*  It's not just Gaza, although Gaza played a major role in this. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4485.34s)]
*  It's not just Gaza. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4491.1s)]
*  It's actually a larger spiritual problem within the heart of the democratic party. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4492.42s)]
*  Your inability or outright disinterest in addressing the needs of the broader population. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4498.22s)]
*  You had hundreds of thousands of people from different walks of life, but especially young [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4507.18s)]
*  people pour out into the streets on college campuses. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4513.38s)]
*  And what did the administration do? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4517.3s)]
*  They said, we're going to combat antisemitism. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4519.1s)]
*  What did they do in the process of combating antisemitism? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4520.9400000000005s)]

*  A higher number of arrests than at January 6. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4529.62s)]

*  Think about that. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4534.86s)]
*  Think about how insane that is. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4537.86s)]

*  He went to Dearborn. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4554.74s)]
*  He ate some Palestinian food. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4556.62s)]

*  How was that possible? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4579.179999999999s)]
*  It's like the tick tock situation all over again. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4580.179999999999s)]

*  Can't do it. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4585.58s)]
*  The Democrats now own the ban of tick tock. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4586.58s)]

*  You should have voted for us. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4645.700000000001s)]

*  And I'm like, why are you mocking people making a rational decision, especially when his fucking [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4689.78s)]
*  party lost a 32 count convicted felon and doesn't win elections outside the national [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4692.86s)]

*  Nothing. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4697.42s)]
*  These fools scolding the Gaza voters are even doing is impacting the elections. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4698.42s)]
*  And the fact that this party has parts of its base choosing nihilism over voting for [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4701.14s)]
*  it in the face of fascism shows us that the nothing the party is doing is having a positive [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4704.38s)]
*  impact on anyone's lives. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4708.62s)]
*  We had around 50% of the electorate choose a felon telling people he would have, he would [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4710.18s)]
*  do the fascism. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4715.1s)]
*  So where does this party get off on mocking anyone pack of losers? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4716.1s)]
*  The other thing that is nuts on it is polling showed that most American Jews believe that [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4719.96s)]
*  what Israel was doing in Gaza was fundamentally wrong. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4723.679999999999s)]
*  So this cow telling a cow tailing or cow telling to fucking donors in Gaza is nuts. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4726.24s)]
*  Once again, out of touch, rich folks steering American politics completely off the rails. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4731.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4737.32s)]
*  There were so many different polls conducted on this. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4739.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4744.48s)]
*  There were so many different polls conducted on the Gaza issue and the broad reception. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4745.879999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4752.4s)]
*  Of the American voter base. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4753.4s)]
*  You had 74% of Republicans or 60% of Republicans, sorry, saying that they want to ceasefire [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4756.799999999999s)]
*  in Gaza. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4765.48s)]
*  They want to make Israel stop. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4766.639999999999s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4769.639999999999s)]
*  Much larger numbers of independence and almost damn near the entirety of the voter base for [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4771.68s)]
*  the democratic party. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4777.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4779.4400000000005s)]
*  This wasn't a secret. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4781.84s)]
*  This was never a secret. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4783.12s)]
*  So if you're sitting around saying like, Oh dude, you know, here you get what you deserve [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4784.4800000000005s)]

*  We admitting that you had no care or consideration for the humanity of these people. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4790.92s)]
*  You actually kind of like that Donald Trump is doing this violence because this kind of [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4798.0s)]
*  violence in your mind is punishing your neighbors who made the wrong choice because all you [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4802.08s)]
*  care about is party. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4808.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4810.5599999999995s)]
*  Party over anything else, partisanship over anything else, especially ironic considering [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4811.5599999999995s)]
*  that if you're not a part of the party structure, then this party doesn't even care about you. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4816.44s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4825.28s)]
*  So no, I will never support mass deportations no matter how many Latinos vote over Donald [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4827.84s)]
*  Trump. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=4832.12s)]

*  everything. They've done this on fucking defunding the police, dude. The Democrats were like [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5113.42s)]
*  Republicans want to defund the police. Not a single voter believed that. What do you [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5120.26s)]
*  mean? The Republicans don't work in the same way. Is this not what Trump ism was all about? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5133.0599999999995s)]
*  Did they not have people on Fox news speaking directly to Trump or Trump ism? No, the people [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5137.62s)]
*  on Fox news are communicating the desires of the broader public to Trump, at least when [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5145.14s)]
*  the election is happening, they are talking to Trump directly, but they're actually talking [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5150.58s)]
*  to Trump directly to communicate the desires of the broader public to Trump. Republicans [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5155.74s)]
*  of their base, Democrats run away from their base. The Democrats disdain their base. Do [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5162.34s)]
*  you understand? This is a key issue here. And there's obviously some structural reasons [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5169.34s)]
*  as to why this is permissible for the Republican party, whereas not allowed for the Democrats. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5176.86s)]
*  One of the key, one of the key issues here, of course, is that the Democratic party, at [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5181.46s)]
*  least on the aesthetic front is advocating for anti-capitalist measures, right? Things that harm [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5185.9s)]
*  the bottom line of corporations. And if both parties are completely captive to corporate [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5192.7s)]
*  interests, then yeah, it's going to be much more difficult for the Democrats to push forward a [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5197.259999999999s)]
*  comprehensive agenda that will undermine corporate profits. Okay. Democrats can't get away with [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5202.58s)]
*  giving into the needs of their base of support because the base of support's needs are health [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5211.74s)]
*  care. We're talking about the eradication of a massive multi-billion, if not trillion dollar [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5221.34s)]
*  sector here, if we're talking about for-profit health care, right? But Republicans can obviously [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5227.139999999999s)]
*  give their base all the red meat that they want because their base is demanding things that do [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5232.26s)]
*  not disrupt the existing hierarchy. Shitting on marginalized people, whether they be trans or [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5237.62s)]
*  undocumented migrants is not disruptive to the pre-existing hierarchy because it's technically [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5243.78s)]
*  not disruptive to capital. It's technically not disruptive to capitalism. Okay. There are exceptions [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5248.9s)]
*  to this, of course, when, you know, someone is really, really invested in doing fascism and [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5256.7s)]
*  we're nearing that disruptive cycle right now with Donald Trump pushing for tariffs and then [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5262.82s)]
*  also Donald Trump pushing for mass deportation of all undocumented migrants. Tariffs are disrupted [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5269.82s)]
*  the capitalism law. No, I understand. That's why I mentioned it. And guess what? They didn't actually [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5280.5s)]
*  get implemented. They did a pause on it and the tariffs were not even for, wait, no, what do you [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5285.9s)]
*  mean? Oh, I'm not yelling at you or anything. I'm saying, yeah, I recognize that. But do those [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5292.66s)]
*  ideas come from the base itself or those on high? No, of course not everything that Donald Trump [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5303.0599999999995s)]
*  does is for the base itself, but all the culture wars that he pursues is for the base. Donald Trump [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5306.82s)]
*  is also, take the trans issue. Okay. This is a minuscule percentage of the population, totally [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5311.94s)]
*  marginal, utterly irrelevant in terms of like what the government is supposed to do. And yet they [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5319.9s)]
*  get talked about endlessly. Okay. Why do they get talked about endlessly? They're portrayed as [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5324.5s)]
*  villains. They're portrayed as contributing to the moral degeneracy of Western civilization in the [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5329.62s)]
*  same vein that Nazis also said the exact same thing about trans people and gay people in general. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5334.86s)]
*  But the reason why they use that as an issue is because it's not disruptive to capital. Okay. It's [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5338.82s)]
*  a great way to shift your attention back to a group of people that are vulnerable and have no [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5346.3s)]
*  serious mechanism of pushback, no legal recourse, no massive lobby, no way to actually actively [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5353.14s)]
*  fight back when the government decides you don't exist anymore. Okay. Same goes for undocumented [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5360.18s)]
*  migrants. And the point I'm making here is that Trump can so easily turn that conversation and [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5366.54s)]
*  reshift his priorities to trans people are undocumented migrants that way. And it's something [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5372.74s)]
*  that he has volunteered before that he, he, Donald Trump has personally stated, and I still [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5377.46s)]
*  remember in front of a massive crowd, I think it was like CPAC or something. It wasn't a CPAC, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5382.98s)]
*  but Donald Trump literally was like, I used to talk about all these different things and you [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5386.74s)]
*  don't cheer as much as you do. When I talk about trans people, Donald Trump himself was pro trans [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5394.3s)]
*  in 2016 when he ran, played a major role in him coming across as a moderate voice to the broader [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5401.02s)]
*  electorate, something that people forget. Okay. By 2024, Donald Trump was obviously vehemently anti [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5406.14s)]
*  trans. That transition happened because this was something that he thought was an, was an adequate [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5414.18s)]
*  way to reshift the priorities of the base and give them some red meat per se. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5421.54s)]
*  Do you understand? He was never pro trans. He just pretended. Yeah, no shit. He doesn't care. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5426.46s)]
*  He's a rich guy. My point is he's a rich asshole. Of course he doesn't care about any of the fucking [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5436.38s)]
*  issues that he talks about. What are you talking about? The only thing he cares about is advancing [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5440.94s)]
*  his own wealth, gaining more power. That's the only thing he cares about. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5446.62s)]
*  A bunch of different possibilities right now, Lindsay. All right, Perry Russell for us. Thanks [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5450.46s)]
*  so much. Let's bring in ABC news contributor and former deputy assistant to secretary of [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5455.14s)]
*  defense for the middle. Yes. Appealing to racism and bigotry is the name of the game. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5459.780000000001s)]
*  Chatters. Yes. Really? Prime minister Netanyahu expected that the Trump would announce today [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5463.62s)]
*  that the U S would take over Gaza. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5469.06s)]
*  So Lindsay, we don't know. He did look somewhat surprised, but they did have a pre-meeting [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5471.660000000001s)]
*  with Steve Witkoff yesterday before this meeting. So I would assume that this topic would [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5477.740000000001s)]
*  The trans issue, even against the trans issue, even against Kamala Harris [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5484.54s)]
*  is not even about trans people itself. It was that Kamala Harris would rather care about the silly [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5491.900000000001s)]
*  shit than help you. Okay. That's why it was effective. Anti-trans sentiment on its own [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5498.9400000000005s)]
*  is not broadly popular. Anti-trans sentiment needs to be packaged in a way where Americans [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5506.46s)]
*  other things that Americans care about have to be harmed somehow. Okay. And this is something that [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5515.18s)]
*  I have repeated over and over again, and it's shown in the internal focus groups that the, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5520.62s)]
*  you know, family matters and all these other like right-wing Christian fascist think tanks [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5527.1s)]
*  have put together. If you just say fuck trans people, they're mentally ill. People look at you [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5531.82s)]
*  and go, ew dude, chill out. But if you say fuck trans people, because they're unfair, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5536.3s)]
*  they they're getting an unfair advantage in sports. They go, yes, I agree. Okay. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5541.74s)]
*  He, a substance very difficult to see how it actually occurred [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5550.14s)]
*  with regard to Trump saying that he would like to see the U S take ownership position in Gaza, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5554.22s)]
*  just in terms of cost and time, what would it take to rebuild Gaza? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5561.02s)]
*  So I've seen estimations that it would take anywhere over 10 to 15 years in custody, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5568.3s)]
*  where between 50 to $65 billion. And that's just basic reconstruction. A lot of that would be, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5573.1s)]
*  of course, dismantling and removing the tons and tons of rubble that has been caused by this [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5579.740000000001s)]
*  conflict. So we'd go potentially 15 years to even get to a place where people could move [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5585.58s)]
*  in and live there if they were doing a complete demolition and then a reconstruction of a 25-mile [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5591.34s)]
*  long strip of land. All right. Nick Mulroy. So appreciate your time as always. Thank you. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5597.9s)]
*  One of president Trump's nominees was just confirmed. Pam Bondi will serve as attorney general [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5604.54s)]
*  after a 54 to 46 vote. Senator Fetterman was the only Democrat to vote yes. Meanwhile, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5608.94s)]

*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. winning approval of the finance committee after the lone Republican [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5641.9s)]
*  holdout Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who was also a doctor, voted yes. Mr. Cassidy. Mr. Cassidy. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5646.7s)]
*  Hi. Cassidy had grilled Kennedy over his years of spreading misinformation about vaccines. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5653.42s)]
*  The senator acknowledged he was struggling with the nomination, but ultimately Cassidy, who is [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5658.86s)]
*  facing reelection next year, fully aware of the pressure he could face for voting no, now giving [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5663.82s)]
*  Kennedy his full support. Ultimately restored. Oh, it's so difficult for him, dude. It was so [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5669.5s)]
*  difficult for him. He really had a crisis. He really had an internal crisis, but of course, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5674.94s)]
*  unsurprisingly, as many Republicans have done time and time again, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5682.22s)]
*  then [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5689.26s)]

*  malnutrition and bringing food, water, shelter and healthcare to victims of natural disasters. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5738.3s)]
*  USAID's $43 billion budget is a tiny fraction of what the government spends about 1%. But Musk, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5743.42s)]
*  who is the world's richest man, posting, we spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5750.3s)]

*  all those workers and their families back to the United States by this weekend. I'm telling you [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5768.22s)]
*  right now, their goal with the USAID thing is to just like centralize the control and take out [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5772.78s)]
*  the remaining parts of USAID. That was actually good and turn it into a pure mechanism for evil. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5779.58s)]
*  Okay. There is no world in which these guys go, Oh, actually we're, we're done interfering in the [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5788.54s)]

*  Any vote for the occupation of Gaza will fail in the Senate. This is a non-starter. What happened [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5827.9s)]
*  to the anti-war president 30 dem knows max. Yeah. I think this is delusional. I think Ruben Gallego [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5845.82s)]

*  to do it. Also, there is no anti-war party. That's it. There is no anti-war party. The Democrats are [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5876.54s)]
*  certainly not the anti-war party. I wanted to agree with that across the entire federal government. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5883.98s)]
*  They want to reshape every agency to their own interest. Someone like Ruby or recognize the [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5887.74s)]
*  weapon that USAID can be. And this is what they mean when they say they will return the agency [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5890.78s)]
*  to its core mission. Yeah. I think they're like, cut it with this like DEI soft power shit. Okay. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5894.22s)]
*  We're not doing that anymore. Not realizing that like that plays a roll. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5901.18s)]
*  Republicans are so funny because they just like fail to comprehend. They fall for their own [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5908.06s)]
*  propaganda. Sometimes there is a attitude brewing in the third world, okay. In the global south, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5912.3s)]
*  and people are going to get very mad at me for saying this. So gear up for it, but there is an [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5920.06s)]
*  attitude in a lot of parts of the world that America has actively destabilized that all this [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5925.74s)]
*  gay shit, okay. Which I 100% obviously agree with, you know, I do a bunch of gay shit myself [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5932.3s)]
*  is seen as like Western interference. Okay. People develop a disdain for it because they see it as [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5939.26s)]
*  like Western interference and Western influence. There's already a fundamentalist principle out [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5946.9400000000005s)]
*  there to begin with in many of these countries, because that's what happens when your country is [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5952.14s)]
*  fucking destabilized. Okay. And the only people that are seen as like devoid of any sort of [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5956.54s)]
*  Western intervention and Western interference are the fundamentalists. Iran is a great case study [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5963.58s)]
*  for this, obviously. So is Afghanistan, but definitely Iran more so than anyone else. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5968.78s)]
*  So many of these countries were like USAID operates, look at, look at a lot of the, the, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5977.74s)]
*  you know, initiatives that America is, is doing in terms of like building up civil society [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5984.0599999999995s)]
*  organizations and things like that as Western interference is like Western influence coming [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5990.0599999999995s)]
*  into the country and looking to seeking out mechanisms of destabilization, whether it's [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=5996.14s)]
*  correct or not, does not matter. This is just the way people view it. Okay. If you are a gay person [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6001.740000000001s)]
*  or trans person living in these countries, you also will seek out the help of these institutions, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6009.820000000001s)]
*  understandably so civil society organizations and whatnot. Okay. So then there's even more disdain [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6015.9800000000005s)]
*  for gay and trans people that disdain already existed. Make no mistake. I'm not saying that [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6023.98s)]
*  these guys like learn to be homophobic because of American intervention or whatever. Okay. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6030.219999999999s)]
*  There's certainly plenty of it already. And it's absolutely represented by the ruling class in [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6034.299999999999s)]
*  these countries. Okay. But this gives them propaganda fodder to say, Oh, look at all these NGOs, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6039.74s)]
*  look at all these civil society organizations. All this gay shit is happening because they want [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6045.339999999999s)]
*  the CIA and Western influence to destabilize the country. Okay. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6050.06s)]
*  Also, it's not that all the USA does like the social media they treated [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6060.9400000000005s)]
*  not like that's all USA does like the social media they created in Cuba. Yes. USAID also plays a role [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6065.580000000001s)]
*  alongside the CIA in destabilizing countries directly. Absolutely. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6070.620000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6080.06s)]
*  In Iran, they have a term gobb got a bizarre day. He roughly translated the Westernification [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6091.02s)]
*  for this USAID gay regime change stuff. Now the irony is if you want to destabilize a country, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6097.34s)]
*  if you want to destabilize a country and you set up civil society organizations, okay, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6110.54s)]
*  that talk about like promoting DI or talk about like, you know, helping gay people, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6117.42s)]
*  then that does actually play a role in beefing up the legitimacy of American intervention. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6123.5s)]
*  That's why for liberals, at least that's why for liberals here in America, they constantly bring up [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6128.9400000000005s)]
*  the horrible treatment of gay people and trans people in these countries or the horrible treatment [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6139.1s)]
*  of women in these countries. Right? Does that, do you understand what I'm saying? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6145.18s)]
*  We're spreading freedom in these nations. We're helping improve the lives of women in these [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6156.06s)]
*  nations. A big part of the Afghan withdrawal and the broad negative reception from American media [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6160.54s)]
*  at the time of Joe Biden's Afghanistan, which all was look at all these women that were harming [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6166.78s)]
*  by destabilizing the green zone by basically abolishing the green zone and Kabul. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6171.9s)]
*  Like it's over now. Afghan women are going to be dominated and it's true. They are right. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6177.259999999999s)]
*  But the adequate way to maintain feminism in Afghanistan or try to build up feminism or [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6184.139999999999s)]
*  a feminist movement in Afghanistan, bombing Afghanistan for years and years, allowing the [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6188.7s)]
*  Taliban to basically grow back in its power and influence and prominence as the sole [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6193.42s)]
*  people that are fighting back against American occupiers and then giving the country back to them. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6197.58s)]
*  Wait, this motherfucker changed the third time. Yes. This chatter says I'm from Egypt now living [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6205.18s)]
*  abroad. A big portion of my family believes that gay representation of Hollywood is a part of [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6209.9s)]
*  us intervention. There's us intervention, but the anger is misplaced towards other marginalized [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6212.86s)]
*  groups is messed up. Definitely compounds on pre-existing conservative values. Exactly. It [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6215.9s)]
*  gives conservatives, which exists in other countries as well, lo and behold, more opportunity [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6219.74s)]
*  to propagandize. I know this from Turkey. That's it. They always say you're a servant of the British [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6224.78s)]
*  or you're a servant of America in Turkey. Ironically enough, out of the one of the biggest [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6231.42s)]
*  servant of American empire, but that's besides the point. They say you're a servant of American [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6234.7s)]
*  empire because you're doing gay propaganda. Okay. He has a lot of confidence. And he thinks that [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6239.42s)]
*  because he's American, it's the U S he can do whatever he wants. He's been able to a lot of [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6248.06s)]
*  the times, but what he doesn't realize is that he doesn't have one dude is a Hassan Abiyah for sure. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6252.3s)]
*  That is that they have their faith and that they know that no matter what happens that they can [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6257.580000000001s)]
*  that they have that to back them up. And as it says in the Quran, the anybody can plan all that [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6262.22s)]
*  they plan Trump plans, everybody plans, but Allah always also plans and no one is a better planner [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6268.54s)]
*  How would you describe currently how this crowd is feeling? I noticed that since this last hour [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6274.22s)]
*  that there's really been more outrage pouring out of you guys. Pissed off. I mean, there's a [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6280.38s)]
*  war criminal on our soil. There's a war criminal where we live right like I live 15 minutes from [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6286.94s)]
*  here. It's maddening obviously. And there's no other reaction other than like, hey, this guy needs [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6292.54s)]
*  to leave. This guy needs to be in prison. That's like the best thing that can happen to him. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6299.1s)]
*  You know, it's funny about the Egyptian conservatives, Egyptian conservative parents [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6302.86s)]
*  of that chatter and another shadow pointed this out, but we say this about Hollywood [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6307.179999999999s)]
*  and America too because there is a hog universality. This is what I always mentioned hog universality. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6310.94s)]
*  It exists. People need to recognize it. But I mean, it's our job to make sure that we're [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6320.139999999999s)]
*  on the right side of history and that at the very least we have, we focus on the things that [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6331.26s)]
*  matter to us that that resonate with us so that in all the evil that's surrounding the world, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6335.58s)]
*  we can at least show up for things that this is for all the liberals gloating uncommitted. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6339.9800000000005s)]
*  Leila El Abed for months, we warned about the dangers of Trump. Our calls largely went unheard. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6344.62s)]
*  Harris left a vacuum by not visiting Michigan families impacted by us bombs. Democrats had a [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6349.02s)]
*  chance to persuade voters. They were the better alternative and they blew it. I feel sad and angry [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6353.5s)]
*  and scared for our communities for months. We warned about the dangers of Trump at home. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6358.94s)]
*  Okay. Uh, Harris led the vacuum by not visiting Michigan families impacted by us supply bombs [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6362.62s)]
*  to help create a permission structure for their trust. While Trump visited Dearborn and filled [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6366.94s)]
*  the community in despair with lies, Trump's illegal calls for ethnic cleansing are horrific. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6370.54s)]
*  But as on so many other issues, Democrats had a chance to persuade voters. They were the better [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6375.0199999999995s)]
*  alternative and they blew it. Okay. And that's precisely what's happening here. That's precisely [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6379.58s)]
*  what happened. And anyone that tries to tell you like, Oh dude, these guys are stupid. Okay. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6384.94s)]
*  Like others care. Law, you're dumb to think that the left cares. I don't even know what [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6394.219999999999s)]

*  And the Democrats communicated only that, okay. Maybe because of the shame that they felt in their [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6414.860000000001s)]
*  hearts, if they're capable of feeling shame, because they were literally killing their immediate [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6421.02s)]
*  family members or whether because they just simply did not care and foolishly thought they could win [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJW4AC48LC4&t=6424.78s)]
