# Trump Says Israel And Iran Agree To Cease | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64)
*  People are like dude if you do these deportations like you're gonna disrupt key sectors of business like there is a lot of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=0.0s)]
*  migrant workers in a lot of these places like this is a tremendous [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=6.4s)]
*  He said GG WP [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=14.36s)]
*  Fox News is live with JD Vance explaining the ceasefire [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=17.84s)]
*  Action of the Iranian nuclear program that has already happened is not something they try to rebuild [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=24.44s)]
*  I want to get to the obliterated part in just a minute [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=29.0s)]
*  But I just want to read this fully so I get the conditions everyone it has been fully agreed by and between [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=31.2s)]
*  Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=36.56s)]
*  Approximately six hours from now when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in-progress final missions for 12 hours [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=40.04s)]
*  At which point the ceasefire for 12 hours at which point the war will be considered ended [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Officially Iran will start the ceasefire and upon the 12th hour Israel will start the ceasefire and upon the 24th hour an official end [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=52.76s)]
*  To the 12-day war will be saluted by the world during each ceasefire [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=59.56s)]
*  The other side will remain peaceful and respectful on the assumption that everything works as it should which it will I would like to congratulate [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=63.28s)]
*  Both countries Israel and Iran and having the stamina courage and intelligence to end what should be called the 12-day war [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=70.16s)]
*  This is a war that could have gone on for years and destroyed the entire Middle East [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=76.6s)]
*  But it didn't and never will God bless Israel God bless Iran God God bless Iran God bless the Middle East God bless the United [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=80.36s)]
*  States of America and God bless the world [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=87.88s)]
*  He seems confident that this is all coming together. That's right [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  And when you left the White House were you thinking this was all gelling here when I left the White House [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  I thought that we might be able to get it across the finish line before this broadcast and it looks like the president has been [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=100.44s)]
*  Able to do that. I mean look he's been working the phones constantly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=105.44s)]
*  Frankly before the 12-day war started but certainly over the past 12 days the president's been extremely clear about America's national [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=108.2s)]
*  Objective here. It is to create a world where Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=115.8s)]
*  We of course destroyed the nuclear program that they had and the president told the entire team [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=120.52s)]
*  We're gonna work to make sure that they don't try to rebuild that nuclear capability in the future [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=125.4s)]
*  And it's look this is a great thing for Israel. Think about this. They've accomplished an important military objective [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  They've helped us destroy the Iranian nuclear program [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=136.52s)]
*  They've also destroyed the conventional missile capability of Iran that threatened the country of Israel for the Iranians [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=139.46s)]
*  I think this is a new opportunity to actually pursue the path of peace as I said yesterday [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=145.52s)]
*  What the Iranians have showed through their support of terror network? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  I think they kicked the can down the road failed effort to build a nuclear weapon is that they're just not very I don't think [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=153.12s)]
*  And I think I don't I do not think is real by the way [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=158.4s)]
*  Ironically enough [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=162.11999999999998s)]
*  America didn't have to fucking respond at all to this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  They could have just done this without trying to blow up the Iranian nuclear facility make no mistake [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=166.72s)]
*  They could have also stopped Israel from even fighting in Iran at all [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=172.55999999999997s)]
*  They accomplished nothing except for more death for no reason [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  created panic created panic and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=184.56s)]
*  basically [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=187.88s)]
*  Israel ate a bunch of missiles for the first time ever in its 77 year history that was actually consequential [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=189.6s)]
*  Having said that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Having said that however, I do think that Israel's ambitions for destabilizing Iran have not gone away [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=197.72s)]
*  That is still their ultimate goal. So we shall see [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=205.16s)]
*  We shall see how they behave going forward and the Israelis and the Iranians have been shooting at each other [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=209.44s)]
*  I think there's some recognition that that might continue for another few hours and tomorrow [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  Really is a new day the end of the 12-day war the end of the Iranian nuclear program [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=219.4s)]
*  And I really do believe the beginning of something very big for peace in the Middle East [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=223.6s)]
*  So you said totally obliterated the president has said totally a brutal obliterated the Iran nuclear program. Yeah [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=227.4s)]
*  Do you know for sure where all the highly enriched uranium is well, Brett? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=234.6s)]
*  I think that's actually not the question before us the question before us is can Iran enrich the uranium to weapons grade level and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=239.32s)]
*  Can they convert that fuel to a nuclear weapon and we know based on the success of our mission? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  of course the leadership of the president but the incredible skill of our military that the two mission objectives are [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=252.22s)]
*  Completely successful. We know that they cannot build a nuclear weapon now you asked about the highly enriched uranium [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=259.2s)]
*  Like 900 pounds but what we know Brett is that in uranium is something that exists [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  Our goal was to bury the uranium and I do think the uranium is buried [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=270.6s)]
*  but our goal was to eliminate the enrichment and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  Eliminate their ability to convert that enriched fuel into a nuclear weapon [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  I actually just I think that's an important point Brett because so many of the folks who have focused on the highly enriched uranium [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  Sure six of them remain focus Brett has been to destroy their enrichment capacity [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=287.68s)]
*  Because we don't want that 60% uranium to become 90% in radium [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=292.8s)]
*  That's the real concern and that's what was so successful about our mission [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=296.92s)]
*  So after all this the Iranian government survives as is what's to stop it from rebuilding over time if they in fact move the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=300.52s)]
*  60% highly enriched uranium, you know, that's the concern [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=308.28s)]
*  No, no, the the big concern Brett and this is again what we destroyed is their ability to enrich uranium if they have [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=311.56s)]
*  60% enriched uranium, but they don't have the ability to enrich it to 90% and further [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=318.28s)]
*  They don't have the ability to convert that to a nuclear weapon that is mission success [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=323.36s)]
*  That is the obliteration of their nuclear program, which is why the president I think rightly is using that term [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=327.56s)]
*  But here's the question if Iran is desperate to build a nuclear weapon in the future [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  Then they're gonna have to deal with a very very powerful American military again [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=338.0s)]
*  Our hope is that the lesson that the Iranians have learned here is look we can fly a bunker buster bomb [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=342.16s)]
*  from Missouri to Iran [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=349.16s)]
*  Completely undetected without landing once on the ground already destroy whatever nuclear capacity [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=351.68s)]
*  Everyone knows this I think that lesson is what's gonna teach them not to rebuild their nuclear capacity [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=356.72s)]
*  Yesterday were you speaking on the president's behalf when you said he was not interested in regime change? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=361.72s)]
*  Well, what I've said is the American military that is not our mission or she they did this in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  2002 they did this in Afghanistan. It was like what when was it the longest the longest running mission [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  Was conducted by the same plane 20 years ago. It again. Why wouldn't there be a regime change me? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=381.56s)]
*  God well [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=388.48s)]
*  I think what the president is saying very clearly Brett is if the Iranian people want to do something about their own leadership [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=389.0s)]
*  That's up to the Iranian people what the American national security of course Iran agreed to a ceasefire [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=395.0s)]
*  They can carry on their new program. I'm in peace now dude if they don't make nukes. They're so dumb and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  I do suspect that they don't so we'll see but I could totally totally totally see [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=405.84s)]
*  I could totally see them not doing new artificial intelligence hardware [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=411.62s)]
*  They want to sort of come into the new economy and that was impossible when you had Iran that was as the president said [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=415.44s)]
*  Acting like a bully across the Middle East we really think that if the Iranians are smart [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=422.44s)]
*  I ran Iran was acting like a born of an economic age of prosperity of course for our Gulf Arab allies [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  For us for the Israelis for everybody, but it's gonna require the Iranians play it smart from here [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=433.68s)]
*  The president called it very weak the Iran missile firing on the US base in Qatar. I'll you deed [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=439.32s)]
*  Was it a face get from that firing missiles at a US base to a ceasefire as he details in this truth [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  So well as the president said they actually gave us some warning here [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=453.46s)]
*  And we think they gave us some warning because they didn't want to kill Americans, and they didn't want to escalate [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=456.24s)]
*  There's definitely some symbolism to this bread if you look at the Iranian attack [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=460.72s)]
*  It was 14 missiles that they telegraphed ahead of time [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=464.7s)]
*  We dropped 14 bunker buster bombs as the president told me earlier our missiles are a little bit bigger than their bombs [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=468.16s)]
*  Our actually accomplished them. I can't believe it. He did it again Donald Trump did it again [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  He broke something for no reason and then let chaos unfold for an extended period of time [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=480.2s)]
*  Only to turn around and be like look at how big of a savior I am [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=487.54s)]
*  This is does this man ever do anything [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=491.22s)]
*  That is not within the Trump playbook where he just goes in breaks something and then [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=495.66s)]
*  It says he's gonna continue breaking it and then stops the further breaking process [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=502.94s)]
*  Half of the shit's broken already and goes look look how amazing I am. I just stopped [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=508.46000000000004s)]
*  I could have broken way more this is insane [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=514.3399999999999s)]
*  He did it he did the exact same thing on [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=518.5s)]
*  everything from tariffs [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=523.2199999999999s)]
*  to to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=525.9s)]
*  Any number of different things that he says he's going to do it's always a spectacular failure and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=527.66s)]
*  The people are basically begging him not to do it [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=535.1199999999999s)]
*  from the start only to turn around and be like well [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=538.54s)]
*  Deportations [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=542.9s)]
*  That's another one people are like dude [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=544.02s)]
*  if you do these deportations like you're gonna disrupt key sectors of business like there is a lot of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=546.3s)]
*  Migrant workers and a lot of these places like this is a tremendous instability. He's like nope. We're doing it and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=551.78s)]
*  Then he goes actually you know what no more no more are we doing deportation for the good immigrants? They're working in the farms [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=558.5s)]
*  The why did you do it to begin with it's everything from the wall to immigration to war [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=566.14s)]
*  Regime because it's evil and horrible has done firing government employees only to rehire them instantly [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=573.5s)]
*  It's only been five months man [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=580.14s)]
*  It's only been five months since this asshole came into power and he's basically done this [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=582.5799999999999s)]
*  He's done this like a hundred different times. It's so [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=589.74s)]

*  And if it's actually over it's only because Iran actually depleted the Israeli air defenses, which would be a pretty solid W [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=927.64s)]

*  This is breaking news that will be continuously updated iran and israel have agreed to a ceasefire [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1203.52s)]
*  Marandi said it's fake [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1208.24s)]

*  I don't know [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1218.72s)]
*  I think iran will eat the ceasefire at any any off ramp that iran will get they'll take [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1220.4s)]
*  I think as much as I respect, uh said muhammad marandi. I think uh [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  I could see america being like oh, it's a ceasefire. We did it [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1234.8000000000002s)]

*  I'm actually surprised. Is this successful deterrence? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1244.96s)]
*  I [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1252.08s)]
*  Mean 12 hours for israel to begin ceasefire but six hours for iran [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1258.8s)]
*  This seems very strange to give israel six hours of unrestrained and unopposed attacks on iran. Yes [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1261.76s)]
*  It could be another trick from the trump administration [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1268.0s)]
*  I [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1270.82s)]
*  Don't know why the iranian government would agree to such an idiotic proposal [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1272.02s)]

*  A senior iranian official told cnn that iran will continue to fight until the lasting peace is achieved [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1286.66s)]

*  The official said at this very moment the enemy is attacking iran and iran is on the verge of escalating its retaliatory attacks [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1294.9s)]
*  And is not listening to the lives of its enemies [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1299.86s)]
*  The funny thing about misdirection as a war tactic is that you can only credibly use it once before it's nullified [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1302.82s)]
*  Trump did that with the initial israel attacks on iran, but now they've painted themselves as untrustworthy in perpetuity over it [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1307.7s)]
*  No, but it doesn't matter when you're the most powerful [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1313.3799999999999s)]

*  Too hopeful is that [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1327.86s)]

*  That there are several points in this regard first. We have to wait to see whether iran is going to accept that proposal [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1349.62s)]
*  Second we are not sure if israelis are going to accept that proposal because of the very fact that we see the continuation also [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1356.68s)]
*  By nature, this is not a fair proposal [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1364.28s)]
*  You just give some time for one of these sides to continue their strikes ask the other to keep silent and go on with just [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1367.96s)]
*  Being silent and then receiving more and more attacks [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1376.6000000000001s)]
*  Targeting your territories that doesn't seem fair and of course [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1380.2800000000002s)]
*  This is going to be something that taken that should be taken into consideration when it comes to iran's [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1383.72s)]
*  calculations and at the time being iran is trying to use the most possible amount of [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1389.6200000000001s)]
*  Strategic precision when it comes to the next steps down the road and also there is one important point that also [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1396.3400000000001s)]
*  Cyril we have to keep in mind iranians are saying that they're going to [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1402.6000000000001s)]
*  Continue to strike back as as long as these really strikes continue [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1406.28s)]
*  The reality on the ground is far from that point that we can see a ceasefire at the time being since they are continuing and also [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1411.08s)]
*  it was [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1418.76s)]
*  a [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1419.8s)]

*  imposed peace if this recent statement by u.s president is going to be [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1427.64s)]
*  considered as a [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1432.82s)]
*  Impose and obviously based upon the previous statements we can say that iran may not accept it [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1434.4199999999998s)]
*  But still we don't have any official statement. We don't have any official [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1440.1999999999998s)]
*  What if what if this is a way? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1445.0s)]
*  To be like oh iran like just lie and say iran told us that we accepted a ceasefire [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1448.04s)]
*  Only to continue bombing israel, so we have to actually be the peacekeepers in the region and attack iran [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1454.84s)]
*  Maybe I don't know. I don't know anymore. This is not a normal state america [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1459.96s)]
*  I'm saying this with 100 sincerity [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1465.24s)]
*  I know this is probably shocking for some people to hear [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1468.28s)]
*  Because your expectation is that like the united states of america is supposed to be this like honest actor here [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1472.04s)]
*  But I can't trust america's statements. I definitely can't trust israel and I 100% in this process at least [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1477.56s)]
*  Trust the iranian side and their assessment of the situation or what they are saying a lot more than I do america [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1485.64s)]
*  They're not the ones who are like oh, let's do a negotiation and then attacked. I mean we're doing a war [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1491.64s)]
*  But it wasn't a war before israel made it a war [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1496.3600000000001s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1500.2s)]
*  It literally wasn't a war before israel decided it is supposed to be a war [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1504.8400000000001s)]
*  Breaking cnn citing an iranian visual tehran has not received any proposal for a ceasefire [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1511.08s)]
*  The statements of israel in the united states are a trick to justify attacks on iranian interests and at this moment the enemy is attacking iran [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1514.52s)]
*  I will say [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  Israel does actually increase the intensity of the strikes, uh right before and they have increased the intensity of the strikes today [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1521.8799999999999s)]
*  So right before a ceasefire happens israel notoriously will blow up way more than they normally do [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1528.76s)]
*  Yet another reason why you should not trust them ever. I don't know anymore. I don't know anymore [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1533.4799999999998s)]

*  We will we will insane conspiracy alert [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1705.4799999999998s)]
*  Let's say masada's actually deeply deeply penetrated the irgc [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1708.44s)]
*  And they assassinated the top level leadership the highest level of loyalty [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1712.84s)]
*  And actually all these other people that are in the irgc that are now taking their places are all also pro israel people [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1717.1599999999999s)]
*  And then they facilitate a military coup [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1722.76s)]
*  Obviously, this is unlikely but i'm saying maybe that's what they're gonna do. Who knows [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1725.24s)]
*  That's why they killed all the high level irgc people ours [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1729.24s)]
*  I think after she posted on [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1733.24s)]
*  That's my conspiracy it feels like a complete bait and switch. I don't believe this by the way neocons warmongers [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1735.24s)]

*  It just feels like after iran stops israel will assassinate ayatollah. I just feel like that happened. Um [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1747.16s)]
*  I I mean they would have I feel like they would have assassinated ayatollah right now [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1754.2s)]
*  Like this was their opportunity [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1758.68s)]
*  I I genuinely believe that when israel started this they thought they could bring america fully [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1760.92s)]
*  And I think they thought they could withstand I think [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1766.2s)]
*  they thought [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1770.68s)]
*  They could withstand uh iranian counters [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1772.2s)]
*  Better than they actually did [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1776.2s)]
*  So they failed on that front [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1778.76s)]
*  Which actually limited to conduct military campaigns? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1780.84s)]
*  um [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1785.0s)]
*  they successfully brought the united states into the conversation but [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1786.76s)]
*  Uh, not beyond the the initial point of escalation [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1790.8400000000001s)]
*  especially because iran did not eat debate and then [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1795.3200000000002s)]
*  Severely escalate and punish america or even close the straight of hormones. So [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1798.52s)]
*  Now there's this supposedly quote-unquote fake ceasefire [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1804.1200000000001s)]
*  Israel did take an l on two fronts. It took an l because it wanted to do the final [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1807.8s)]
*  The the the uh final solution to iran destabilized the iranian government [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1814.1200000000001s)]
*  Destroyed as a state, uh, and it failed to do so [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1820.44s)]
*  Uh, it it failed to bring america in to be able to do, uh this this final ambition [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1824.2s)]
*  How is it fake? Well, the iranian side says that it's not real [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1831.56s)]
*  Israel is bombing tehran iran is saying that they're going to bomb tel aviv any moment now [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1836.92s)]
*  Doesn't seem like a very good ceasefire proposal. I still think it's probably [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1842.44s)]
*  I still think it's probably real, but I don't know [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1847.24s)]
*  I think you're wrong israel predicted they would lose about four to five thousand people in a war with iran and they only lost [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1849.56s)]
*  About six are you insane? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1854.36s)]
*  You think the israeli government was willing to kill [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1856.92s)]
*  5 000 jews in israel [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1860.58s)]
*  So they could bomb iranian military positions [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1863.48s)]
*  Do you know how much of a destabilizing force that would be for israeli society israel would be over they might as well [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1867.48s)]
*  They might as well end the government right then and there yeah what they say and what they actually believe is crazy brother [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1873.5600000000002s)]
*  who [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1881.0s)]
*  Who would you ever who would you ever be able to? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1882.44s)]
*  to to prove to who would you ever be able to prove to that like [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1886.2s)]
*  Tel Aviv is the safest place on the planet for jews ever again if israel's actions amounted to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1891.0800000000002s)]
*  5 000 jews dying in the process [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1896.9s)]
*  Because they literally decided that they wanted to go with the war with iran and then iran just pummeled their uh pummeled [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1899.22s)]
*  The the residential buildings and pummeled the neighborhoods and even the bunkers and shit like that [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1907.0600000000002s)]
*  It would be over that the israeli project is done. America would also join the I think america would probably join the fight [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1912.98s)]
*  The moment that like more than 25 elderly jewish people died [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1920.66s)]
*  They also failed at keeping uh the war going on for longer [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1925.06s)]
*  So attention come back to gaza to some extent if this report is true [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1928.1799999999998s)]
*  50 civilians seeking as in many other days, but it got negligible media coverage [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1931.3799999999999s)]
*  Usually this would be on the front page of ha'aretz [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1935.1399999999999s)]
*  But everything is full of iran now and i'm sure this is true to an extent internationally. It absolutely is no one [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1937.3799999999999s)]
*  Is even remotely talking about gaza. I have here but I have yet to see any fucking serious coverage being [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1942.02s)]
*  Uh talked about in gaza [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1950.02s)]
*  The one senator much props, uh is is given here is is chris van holland [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1952.34s)]
*  chris van holland tweeted yesterday [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1959.1399999999999s)]
*  uh released a statement saying [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1961.22s)]
*  400 plus [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1963.28s)]
*  Palestinians were slaughtered on their way to receive aid to get aid while since the beginning of of uh, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1965.28s)]
*  israel strikes on iran very little attention very little attention has been given to [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1973.06s)]
*  To to israel's conduct in in gaza. What is this? No, this is the same article that we saw this is the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2GgobKh64&t=1978.42s)]
