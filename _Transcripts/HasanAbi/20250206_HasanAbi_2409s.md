# The Wonderful Journey In Japan Has Ended | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE)
*  I got to the airport and I'll be honest with you. I got some I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=0.0s)]
*  got some thoughts for Japanese air. I went with Japanese [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=5.44s)]
*  airlines. Okay. I flew in with all Nihon all Nippon air and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=8.88s)]
*  then I flew back with JAL. Okay, Anna is what I flew in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=14.8s)]
*  with JAL is what I flew out with. I just experienced this day [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  yesterday in Japan. And it is the same day once again. Wow. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=27.58s)]
*  This is part of the broadcast where I tell you about my [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=32.06s)]
*  personal news before you guys say where's Kaya where's Kaya I [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=33.62s)]
*  understand she is coming in a little bit in like 20 minutes [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=36.26s)]
*  actually should be here in 20 minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=40.94s)]
*  I am a time traveler. That's right. I have an announcement [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=46.22s)]
*  through time. New time zone unlocked. All right. New camera [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=51.94s)]
*  is so nice. It's not the new camera. It's the old camera. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=55.54s)]
*  The lighting is also needs a little bit of work. If we're [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=57.9s)]
*  being real, it's a little blown out in the back as you guys can [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=61.78s)]
*  see, but I wanted to get the house and I be gaming team in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=64.3s)]
*  here working while I was out in Japan. And they worked tirelessly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=69.66s)]
*  to put this together and make sure that we had a new setup. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=74.02s)]
*  I've been wanting to make this switch for some time now, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=78.9s)]
*  because I wanted more room for activities behind me. And I [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=84.61999999999999s)]
*  think this is better overall for having guests on board as well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=88.69999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, blown out your back is blown out like I'm blowing your [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=94.02s)]
*  back out. No. All right. So folks, folks, folks, folks, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  folks, let me tell you something. Okay. This is the part [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=99.97999999999999s)]
*  of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=103.06s)]
*  what's going on in the world of a son house and I'll be playing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=105.3s)]
*  in between the time period where I press the stop streaming [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=107.22s)]
*  button and press the start streaming button. And a lot has [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=108.94s)]
*  happened as you guys may or may not know the camera needs to be [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=111.66s)]
*  stopped down by like 0.7 EV. I'm a photographer. Please trust [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=114.86s)]
*  our trust. Oh, set up is going to take some time to get used [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=118.66s)]
*  to. I just hit a Homer Simpson. Dope. Anyway, folks, folks, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=121.22s)]
*  folks, folks, folks, this is part of the broadcast where I [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  tell you about my personal news about what's going on in the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=130.26s)]
*  world of a son house and I've been playing in between the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=132.3s)]
*  time period where I press the stop streaming button and press [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=133.74s)]
*  the start streaming button. And here's what I need to tell you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=135.3s)]
*  yesterday and the broadcast. You already know that. Okay. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=138.18s)]
*  End of the broadcast after six hours or whatever, you know, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=141.58s)]
*  half day, not a big deal, basically quitting quiet [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=144.9s)]
*  quitting, but also loudly quitting. You know, at this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=147.94s)]
*  point, what the hell is wrong with me? But part of the reason [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=150.86s)]
*  why I had to quit early after six hours, do stuff before I [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=154.1s)]
*  flew out, I had to go and get a new suitcase. The reason why I [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  had to go and get a new suitcase, because even though I [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  have a massive suitcase, like a ginormous suitcase, I needed, I [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=167.34s)]
*  needed a second one. What the fuck is that New York fit? This [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=173.9s)]
*  is my Tokyo fit mine suitcase. Yeah, exactly. I need to get a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=177.22s)]
*  goon case for all the goon cave toys. But yeah, I'm going to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=181.7s)]
*  show you in a second what I what I have in that bag. I'm going [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=185.46s)]
*  to bust it open. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=189.3s)]
*  How disappointed I was that not Austin nor will nor Hassan try [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  to get my onsen stream hands off. You have any idea of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=199.38s)]
*  offense I took to that? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  I was certain. It was certain that there would be at least some [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  effort to get me into an onsen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  No real tricks. The packer suitcase inside another empty [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  suitcase and fly with them. Check one bag fly out with two if [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=217.66s)]
*  you know, you know. Yeah, I can't do that. I couldn't do that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=220.78s)]
*  because I had already it's 14 day travel chatter. It's a 14 day [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  travel situation. There was no world in which I could pack [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=230.9s)]
*  another suitcase into my existing suitcase. Because I [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=235.9s)]
*  just I already needed to I bought so many clothes when I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  was there. I bought so much underwear while I was there. It [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=245.34s)]
*  was crazy. Oh, what's happening with the frickin focus the auto [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=247.98s)]
*  focus is a little busted. But yeah, lighting works in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=252.26s)]
*  mysterious ways. You were dark in Japan. Now you're light. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=257.02s)]
*  Yeah. Can you do a clothing haul? No. Bro thinks is Tarkov a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=260.18s)]
*  little bit. You have a lifetime bro got a lifetime supply of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=265.66s)]
*  family marty's ish true. I did. I actually did. But yeah, I had [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=269.26s)]
*  to go and get a suitcase. And then I thought I could hang out [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=274.58s)]
*  with March and waken them a little bit and March was like, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=278.3s)]
*  dude, if you don't leave right now, you're cooked. Because it [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=280.58s)]
*  was like by 2pm. It was like 2pm. And I was still thinking [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  like my flight's at 430. I'll be fine. We can hang out because I [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  didn't want to leave. And March was like, you are gonna miss [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=295.58s)]
*  your flight. So I reluctantly left. I had to checked in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=299.98s)]
*  luggage to but I got another one right here. I bought I bought [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  this one. Which basically is like big enough that it took 18 [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=313.1s)]
*  kilograms of clothes and stuff. But it's also small enough that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  it could be checked in luggage. I didn't check it in though. I [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=327.1s)]
*  actually because I didn't want to carry it around with me. So I [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=329.9s)]
*  put all the put all my anime figurines and stuff in there. But [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=332.73999999999995s)]
*  after that, yeah, anime figurines and Tenga and all the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=337.14s)]
*  stuff that I got from JCP. But basically, I got to the airport. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  And I'll be honest with you. I got some I got some thoughts for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  Japanese air. I went with Japanese airlines. Okay. I flew [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=353.41999999999996s)]
*  in with all Nihon all Nippon air and then I flew back with [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=358.74s)]
*  JAL. Okay, Anna is what I flew in with JAL is what I flew out [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  with. And let me tell you, there's some good and there's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=367.86s)]
*  some bad. Now first of all, JAL actually has apparently a first [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=371.02s)]
*  class as well. And usually when they have a first class, when [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=375.06s)]
*  they have a first class, usually the business class is like kind [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=379.5s)]
*  of I mean, it's still great, still business class, but it's [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=384.02s)]
*  not as good normally. But I will say Anna did not have a first [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=386.58s)]
*  class. It was just a business class. And JAL was literally [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=390.9s)]
*  better than Anna. Austin was telling me that Anna is the best [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=394.5s)]
*  one. And JAL is the second best. Or I think it was March who said [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=398.74s)]
*  that, but JAL was, was definitely a better experience [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=401.14s)]
*  overall. I'm going to give you very quickly. What was so sick [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=406.82s)]
*  about it? One, the little bags that they give you on airplanes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't like the little bag, the little baggy shit that they [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=414.9s)]
*  give you some air, some airliners still do it for economy [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=418.58s)]
*  toiletries. Some don't do it anymore. Like the amenity kits. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=424.02s)]
*  And in business class, it's nicer, right? They give you like [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=428.26s)]
*  nicer shit, like a swag bag. I never take it because the hell [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=431.65999999999997s)]
*  am I supposed to do, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=435.97999999999996s)]
*  JAL gave me this like puffy eye bag steam mask. I've never gotten [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  that before on any flight. I thought that was awesome. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=445.14s)]
*  Number two, take it and save it for later. No, I have, I've [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=448.62s)]
*  already, I, by the way, when I say I don't actually use it, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  that's a lie. Cause one time it was like a to me bag. I forget [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=454.62s)]
*  which airliner gave it to me. And I still use that as my [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=459.3s)]
*  toiletries bag to this day. Cause it's like perfectly [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=461.5s)]
*  sized. But I usually don't take it. But I do use the stuff [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=463.82s)]
*  that's in it. JAL gave, gave you an iPhone charger, which was [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=468.18s)]
*  insane. And also a little like stand that you can put your [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=473.97999999999996s)]
*  iPhone on. And it's like so cheap, technically, but it's so [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=478.58s)]
*  there's so much utility to it. You know what I mean? Like, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=483.5s)]
*  because normally the amenities kit is like silly shit, you [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=487.94s)]
*  know, all like, here's some makeup remover or I don't know [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=491.22s)]
*  what they put in there. I don't even look at it, but they, they [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=496.22s)]
*  gave you like a, like a USB charger for the iPhone and they [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=499.62s)]
*  gave you a little plastic thing that is super cheap, but it is [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=503.74s)]
*  super cheap, but it opens up and then you can place your iPhone [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=510.5s)]
*  on it. So it like, you know, so you can watch it. And I thought [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=512.78s)]
*  it was like such a, I mean, it was very, it was, it was very [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=516.22s)]
*  thoughtful. You know what I mean? Because it's so [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=520.38s)]
*  convenient. It's so goddamn convenient when you think about [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=522.46s)]
*  it. And it's just, I thought it was great. The food was [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=525.78s)]
*  excellent on Japanese airlines in comparison to Ana. Ana, not [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=528.74s)]
*  great. The food was not good at Ana at all. The food on JAL was [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=533.38s)]
*  good. At Honda Airport, I got on the Honda Airport. Sweaty is a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=537.18s)]
*  sweaty sweaty as heck. Okay, I get to Honda Airport and base [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=543.18s)]
*  what kind of food they had. Oh, they had, they had really good [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=548.62s)]
*  food. They had this thing where they had the, the, the Tomoko [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=551.62s)]
*  Sando's and pork cut. So Sando's. So I, that's why I liked [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=555.78s)]
*  it a lot. Anyway, I get to haunted a hundred is a very nice [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=559.38s)]
*  airport and I'm panicking. I have a lot of bags. I brought [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=561.62s)]
*  three technically checked in like a three luggage. Like I [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=568.34s)]
*  have my stream backpack. I have my regular sling bag that has [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=572.22s)]
*  the press tag on it. And then on top of that, I had the, the, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=577.02s)]
*  obviously the, the, the third bag was my remote desktop setup, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=585.62s)]
*  right? And I have to bring that with me everywhere I go. I have [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=589.3s)]
*  to bring all of those things with me wherever I go. So, so [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=592.3s)]
*  I have three carry ons and I have two checked in luggage, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=595.74s)]
*  luggage. I checked in 36 kilograms. Now, normally, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=599.98s)]
*  especially when you're flying business, they don't really [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=605.5799999999999s)]
*  stress that sort of thing, but you're allowed to fucking check [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=607.4599999999999s)]
*  in three different pieces of luggage if you want to. But [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=609.98s)]
*  apparently it's 32, 32 is the limit. And for that reason, 32 [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=613.4599999999999s)]
*  is the limit for gel. So for that reason, they were like, oh [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=621.34s)]
*  yeah, either you can go down the, you know, down the corner, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=625.38s)]
*  buy a new piece of luggage, put all of your stuff in this [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=629.86s)]
*  luggage. Okay. So that you can get it to 32 kilograms, or you [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=633.06s)]
*  just need to pay extra. Okay. And to be fair, it's a two week [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=638.6199999999999s)]
*  trip. So yes, I obviously had a lot of shit. But normally they [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=642.54s)]
*  don't really care because you know, you get three pieces of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=647.06s)]
*  luggage all up to 32 kilograms or just 70 pounds, right? So or [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  80 pounds. So I'm thinking it should be fine. It's not fine. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=654.6999999999999s)]
*  They charged my ass 60,000 yen for the convenience. 60,000 [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=659.38s)]
*  yen. Now, in the past, as a as a very penny pinching traveler. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=664.9s)]
*  No, it's $400. Chad is not $5. Yeah, try 400. 400 American. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=676.18s)]
*  That's insane. Okay, that is a highway robbery. They literally [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=682.86s)]
*  robbed me at gunpoint. Normally, I would have just went [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=687.42s)]
*  and bought a $400 piece of luggage at that point. You know [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  what I mean? Just go buy $400 like a very nice backpack for [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=693.62s)]
*  $400. Then you can put the fucking the all of your equipment [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=698.38s)]
*  in it. No wonder they gave you an iPhone charger. No, it's a [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=703.14s)]
*  major scam. It's a major fucking scam. Major, major, major. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=706.78s)]
*  You get it like a fucking Ramo vote for $400. Okay. And they [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=711.3399999999999s)]
*  cooked me because I didn't have time because I didn't have time. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=715.22s)]
*  I did not have enough time to literally go buy another bag and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=719.78s)]
*  then dump out my fucking big ass 36 kilogram bag, which is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=724.3000000000001s)]
*  like 80 plus pounds, almost 90 pounds at that point. Like I [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=728.26s)]
*  mean, 80 pound bag, and then move stuff around. So basically, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=731.02s)]
*  they were like, Yeah, either this or you don't get on the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=736.3000000000001s)]
*  plane. I mean, you had two weeks. Yeah, but I didn't I didn't [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=739.38s)]
*  weigh my luggage. That's a ticket like that's a flight. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=743.74s)]
*  That's a different flight. I could have gotten a different [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=746.78s)]
*  flight at that point. You know what I mean? And it's a it's [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=748.9s)]
*  highway robbery. And I was thinking, I was thinking in my [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=751.46s)]
*  mind, weigh your shit, bro. How am I supposed to weigh my shit? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=756.26s)]
*  I'm in a hotel like there's no weighing your shit in a hotel. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=758.74s)]
*  But basically, basically, by a scale. Yeah, I'm not gonna buy a [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=762.38s)]
*  scale. No, I did not have a bathroom scale. I don't think or [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=769.1s)]
*  maybe they I did, but I wasn't aware of it. Could have bought a [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=772.62s)]
*  seat for that suitcase. I know I know I love that. Look, my point [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=775.7s)]
*  of the story is, this is yet another way in which wealth [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=779.34s)]
*  dramatically improves your life, and also makes you out of touch [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=784.0600000000001s)]
*  with the common folk in general. Okay, at least from my [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=788.66s)]
*  experience, because I've been in that situation before, in the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=793.1s)]
*  past, and I've had to do crazy shit. I've had to beg, cry, get [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=796.42s)]
*  on my hands and he's a please, can you let this slide? And in [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=802.34s)]
*  this instance, I was like, I'm cooked. Fuck it. Fuck it. We [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=805.86s)]
*  ball. So I dropped the fucking four bills on that shit. A [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=809.14s)]
*  punishment. Oh, wait, I think I is here. Hold on. Oh my god. Oh, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=812.9s)]

*  wow, the lighting is a little bit better on this one. This is [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1003.46s)]
*  like a impromptu de facto Chi cam. And then this is the wide [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1007.1s)]
*  one. Please set the clock. Okay, get her bed where your suitcase [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1012.9s)]

*  utilize the space. Okay, honestly, the alt angles are [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1019.98s)]
*  better lit than the main one that would make all the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1023.38s)]
*  difference. Yeah, this does look better. But yeah, where was I? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1025.42s)]
*  Look at her again. I missed her so much. Is it possible to just [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1030.58s)]
*  the brightness on the Hassan Abbey lamp? Yeah. Anyway, we're [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1033.82s)]
*  not going to do that right now. Where was I with my story? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1036.58s)]
*  Getting back to my story. Even though this is blown out. How are [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1039.9399999999998s)]
*  you not jet lagged? I'm a goddamn G. I'm a goddamn legend. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1045.86s)]
*  I'm a freaking I'm a freaking legend, dude. That's what it is. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1049.1s)]
*  So where was I? Where was I? Do you try choco banana? No. Did you [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1053.8999999999999s)]
*  bring a Dragon Ball back? Oh, yeah, I got scammed out of 400 [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1058.6599999999999s)]
*  bucks. So that was a big L for gel. And it made me want to not [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1061.22s)]
*  actually fly with them that experience. But then they they [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1067.3s)]
*  sucked me back in even though the I will say this, the [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1071.54s)]
*  business class obviously is lie flat. But I didn't get to sleep [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1076.3s)]
*  too much. Because unfortunately, both Anna and gel, all Nihon [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1080.22s)]
*  all neat, neat bone air, and gel itself. Japanese airlines are [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1086.06s)]
*  built for much smaller people. So even if it's like a lie flat, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1093.22s)]
*  I can't technically lie flat. Not gonna lie, you got scammed [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1100.38s)]
*  with the fruit too. Yeah, I will never fly again. This current [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1105.46s)]
*  crisis is clenched it for me. What this what I explained to [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1108.06s)]
*  you. But yeah, then I got back to the land of the free home of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1111.46s)]
*  the brave. And let me tell you, okay, let me tell you, let me [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1114.26s)]
*  tell you something not good. Not good at all. Okay. I finally I [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1117.74s)]
*  finally come back. And instantly, one of the things that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1123.7s)]
*  you experience when you come back to America, especially [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1127.3400000000001s)]
*  after coming back from Japan, the land of public transit and [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1129.38s)]
*  where things just work. You know, you didn't get scam gel [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1133.02s)]
*  try to accommodate baggage that is beyond internal international [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1137.38s)]

*  safety fair. Did you fly the room on Anna on the way there the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1142.7s)]
*  seat config is slightly different? No. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1145.78s)]
*  Especially when you come to Los Angeles Airport, LAX, after [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1151.7s)]
*  Haneda, you're like, are we on the same planet? Like, is this [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1156.8999999999999s)]
*  the same universe? It feels like it feels like you just came back [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1160.94s)]
*  to earth after encountering an alien species. Okay, when you [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1166.0s)]
*  come back to LAX, it is objectively one of the worst [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1171.3s)]
*  airports on the planet. Going from, you know, going from [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1174.3s)]
*  Haneda to Tom Bradley International. Okay, going from [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1178.86s)]
*  Haneda to Tom Bradley International is, I assume what [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1184.34s)]
*  it's like when you when you reach like an uncontacted tribe [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1189.46s)]
*  and you're like, wow, but actually, that's not true, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1193.18s)]
*  because an uncontacted tribe still is more harmonious in [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1195.82s)]
*  their peaceful coexistence with nature than LAX is in general. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1199.3799999999999s)]
*  LAX, specifically Tom Bradley International is all bad, no [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1205.3s)]
*  good. Okay. It's so fucking bad. It blows my mind how bad it is. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1209.94s)]
*  It blows my mind. What is so great about Haneda? It's kind of [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1219.34s)]
*  bare. That's what's so great about it. I've had long [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1222.82s)]
*  conversations with my brother, Mr. airplanes about this issue [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1226.4199999999998s)]
*  time and time again. I don't care about like how cool an [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1230.9399999999998s)]
*  airport looks, which LAX doesn't look cool anyway. Already being [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1235.78s)]
*  bad. She just got back from school and she's already trying [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1239.78s)]
*  to get up. Like I, I don't care about how bare an airport is. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1242.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to spend the minimal amount of time inside of an [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1247.9399999999998s)]
*  airport. Okay, I am trying to spend as little amount of time as [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1250.6999999999998s)]
*  possible when I'm inside of an airport. As long as it's clean [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1256.06s)]
*  and as long as you're just in and out clean and efficient, I'm [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1260.26s)]
*  good. Okay, LAX not clean, not efficient, just awful. Just [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1264.02s)]
*  awful in general. You get out, there are 1000s of people trying [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1270.94s)]
*  to get into the country. So there's TSA global entry, right? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1274.82s)]
*  Which I now officially am going to have I think finally, after [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1278.9s)]
*  they took like years and years of processing me for some [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1284.3799999999999s)]
*  reason. I did do that afterwards. But basically, there's [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1287.34s)]
*  TSA precheck global entry on one side. And then on the other [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1293.1s)]
*  side, it's it's residents, green card holders and American [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1296.4599999999998s)]
*  citizens. There are 1000s of American citizens that are trying [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1300.1399999999999s)]
*  to enter the country. Do you want to know how many people [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1303.58s)]
*  were were working the Customs and Border Patrol processing [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1307.58s)]
*  entries into the country? Three, one for global entry, two for [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1312.42s)]
*  everybody else. Three. It's like, it's mind boggling to me [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1318.22s)]
*  how it is mind boggling to me how much of the issues that we [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1325.38s)]
*  experience as consumers as travelers in every aspect of our [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1331.02s)]
*  lives. Okay? How much of the quote unquote problem could be [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1335.34s)]
*  solved if they just hired more people. If you're not going to [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1343.1399999999999s)]
*  do E gates, just hire more people hire more Customs and [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1346.58s)]
*  Border Patrol officers. Like literally, this is the one job [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1350.6999999999998s)]
*  that they're supposed to be doing, making sure that you're [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1354.02s)]
*  not bringing in agricultural harmful to the ecosystem in [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1356.3799999999999s)]
*  America. And you know, I guess drug trafficking or whatever, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1359.62s)]
*  like that's the thing that they're supposed to do is [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1363.26s)]
*  process people into the country in an expedient, expedient [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1366.06s)]
*  in a fast manner, expedient manner. That's the job. That's [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1370.98s)]
*  your job as a CBP guy. And even on that front, they're like, nah, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1374.66s)]
*  dog, we're too busy. Expeditious expeditiously. Even in that [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1378.26s)]
*  regard, we're like, nah, we have ICE agents that are supposed to [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1383.02s)]
*  be locking up Guatemalan, you know, Guatemalan aunties out [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1385.74s)]
*  here. So there's just not enough time. There's not enough. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1389.98s)]
*  There's not enough bandwidth to process people coming in. What? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1393.5s)]
*  Wait a minute. I'm confused. You were trying to say earlier [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1396.5s)]
*  that if you're poor and can't pay those 400, you can get away [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1398.3s)]
*  with it. Oh, when I was broke, and they would try to hit me [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1400.58s)]
*  with like a back situation like that. Yeah, I'd try to talk my [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1405.22s)]
*  way out of it. Sometimes they let you slide. I travel [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1407.9s)]
*  internationally, every often in and out of the US and getting [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1411.3s)]
*  through the US customs, the worst part of my travel and [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1413.66s)]
*  having a green card is definitely not making it easier. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1415.26s)]
*  Don't you have electronic entry for us? It is no anyway. The [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1417.86s)]
*  point is most things that suck, suck because they just don't [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1421.02s)]
*  hire enough people. So that was step one. That was annoying. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1427.1399999999999s)]
*  Step two, I get to the global entry interview, right? Because [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1431.4599999999998s)]
*  it's been, it's been ready for some time now. And the gate guy [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1436.54s)]
*  was like, Oh, you have your interview set up like you can go [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1440.4199999999998s)]
*  do it right now downstairs. I was like, you know what, if [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1442.78s)]
*  there's no line, I'm going to do it. There's no line. The fucking [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1445.22s)]
*  computer was not working. Like everything sucks. Everything is [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1448.3s)]
*  broken. Everything is broken beyond repair everywhere in this [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1453.5s)]
*  goddamn country. And just like when you combine all of those [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1458.42s)]
*  little things are like, oh, we are so fucking washed dog. We [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1461.26s)]
*  are washed. Okay, the United States of America is officially [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1464.8600000000001s)]
*  washed. Anytime you feel like you're being screwed over. In [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1468.66s)]
*  most circumstances, it is a direct consequence of not [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1473.7s)]
*  actually hiring enough people. Oh, your luggage didn't arrive [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1478.66s)]
*  on time. They didn't hire enough luggage handlers. Okay, that's [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1481.82s)]
*  it. It's literally that simple. They're overworking the luggage [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1484.8600000000001s)]
*  handlers that are working and they didn't hire enough knowing [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1487.22s)]
*  full well that there was going to be, you know, additional need [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1490.3s)]
*  for additional hands. Your anytime you have issues with [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1492.9s)]
*  like any kind of service that you're receiving, it is a direct [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1499.02s)]
*  consequence of being is a direct consequence of underpaying [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1502.78s)]
*  hiring, not enough people and overworking the people that you [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1506.98s)]
*  have hired. It's absolute garbage. Did you compare this to [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1510.18s)]
*  the Japanese airport experience? Yeah, the Japanese airport [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1513.58s)]
*  experience is like everything works. Everything works. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1515.42s)]
*  Everything is fast. Kaia place. Get back there. What is this? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1517.34s)]
*  Don't worry. Ilana does you gonna fix all this though? Yeah, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1522.06s)]
*  he just needs access to all of our finances. Hey, my DMV [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1524.62s)]
*  workers when they're underwired. People hate DMV workers when [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1527.1399999999999s)]
*  they're underwired. Can you tell us what the questions you were [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1529.82s)]
*  asked? Yeah, they asked me about my my DUI from fucking 2014 [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1531.9s)]
*  when I got arrested for a DUI and I was like, I only got [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1537.22s)]
*  arrested. I never got prosecuted. And it's like weird because in [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1539.1000000000001s)]
*  the system is she still shows as like a misdemeanor, which is [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1541.94s)]
*  weird because I never was charged. I never even was [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1546.0600000000002s)]
*  prosecuted. I was just arrested for it. But it doesn't matter. It [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1549.38s)]
*  was 11 years ago anyway. So I think it's like you can have one [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1553.74s)]
*  misdemeanor on your record and you can have one misdemeanor [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1556.46s)]
*  on your record. It shows everything. But basically, I [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1561.86s)]
*  think yeah, you can have one misdemeanor on a record if it's [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1567.54s)]
*  in the and if it's outside of the five year scope, it doesn't [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1569.9399999999998s)]
*  matter. But you can have one year, one misdemeanor on your [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1572.6999999999998s)]
*  record in the first in the last five years and that you can [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1575.3799999999999s)]
*  still get it. But apparently you can use your global entry. You [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1578.1399999999999s)]
*  can lose your global entry for like, really silly reasons like [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1581.8999999999999s)]
*  you can lose your global entry if you brought in food from the [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1586.02s)]
*  airplane into the country and you had like an annoying what [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1589.8999999999999s)]
*  explained DUI story so you don't clip champ. What do you mean? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1595.78s)]
*  I've explained it a million times over. Did you actually drive [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1598.4199999999998s)]
*  drunk? No, I actually that's the reason why I didn't get [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1601.86s)]
*  prosecuted. I actually was under the legal limit, but I got an [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1604.6999999999998s)]
*  annoying fucking cop who just like made me blow on the thing [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1608.3799999999999s)]
*  numerous times so he could arrest me for it. But I actually [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1613.1s)]
*  didn't get prosecuted for it because the blood work showed [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1618.62s)]
*  that I was under the legal limit. And weren't you just [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1621.58s)]
*  sleeping in your car? No, I've that's a different story. I [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1623.9799999999998s)]
*  have. I've gotten ticketed for sleeping in my car before. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1627.1799999999998s)]
*  Really annoying. But that's a that's a separate story. You [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1630.3s)]
*  have to be really blatant about sneaking stuff in to lose it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1634.1s)]
*  But food and shit is highly unlikely. No, no. I mean, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1636.3s)]
*  basically, if it was if you had like an annoying border guard or [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1639.3799999999999s)]
*  whatever, they can actually they can actually come in and just [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1642.82s)]
*  be like, What do you have in your bag? Oh, you have food in [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  your bag. You have produce in your bag or whatever. Like [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1647.8s)]
*  you're cooked anyway. So you sobered up by the time blood [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1650.48s)]
*  work happened. My drunk uncle did that too. Law. I like that [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1653.08s)]
*  you don't even know the story, but that's your that's your [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1655.76s)]
*  perspective. No, dumbass. That's not what happened. It's [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1659.08s)]
*  literally I was under the I wasn't driving inebriated last [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1663.44s)]
*  time I had. Oh my God. Why am I talking about this? This is [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1668.0s)]
*  going to make it this is going to make it into the next [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1671.36s)]
*  content nuke. Things that I have explained, things that I've [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1673.12s)]
*  explained a million times over. My personal experiences that [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1677.24s)]
*  voluntarily revealed about myself, that people act as [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqKgc-GFAFE&t=1681.5s)]
