# Why Did The Soviet Union Fall? | HasanAbi Reacts to Hakim
**HasanAbi:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM)
*  Furthermore, these theories ignore the actual history of liberal democracy and socialist democracy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=0.0s)]
*  Democracy for- [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=4.4s)]
*  The real has no piece of Hut and Pepsi is what led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=5.4s)]
*  I believe, I believe personally, that it's very easy to petition the Trump administration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Here, we'll watch Hockey Computer on the collapse of the USSR. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=25.6s)]
*  There's quite a bit of mythology around the dissolution of the largest nation of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=29.2s)]
*  previous century. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=32.0s)]
*  Every side of the spectrum has given their reasoning, with some being more believable [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=33.46s)]
*  than others. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=36.48s)]
*  Here, I hope to show the common arguments and hopefully help you reach your own conclusions. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=37.48s)]
*  This video is a partial transcript based on the book Socialism Betrayed! [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=41.86s)]
*  Behind the Collapse of the Soviet Union by Roger Kieran and Thomas Kenny. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=44.8s)]
*  I strongly recommend you pick the book up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=47.6s)]
*  It is by far the best study of the dissolution of the USSR that I've ever come across. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Anyways, let's get into it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  According to the book, these arguments can be broken down into six categories- [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Bro, bro put this hotline on here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=57.64s)]
*  Or no, it's not, he didn't put it, sorry. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  F***ing Google did. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  He's found in academic literature, supposed flaws of socialism, popular opposition, external [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=65.12s)]
*  factors, bureaucratic counterrevolution, lack of democracy and over-centralization, and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  the Gorbachev factor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=76.08s)]
*  The Gorbachev factor, also known as the Trumpian, also the modern version is the Trump factor. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  Those that support the first theory think all strands of socialism, no matter how you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=88.04s)]
*  fail. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Usually they bring this down to the human nature argument, as flawed an argument as [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=92.64s)]
*  it may be, and appeals to the superiority of the free market. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Those that support this theory, or variations thereof, include Martin Malia, Richard Pipes, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=100.28s)]
*  and Dmitry Volkoganov. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=105.36s)]
*  Despite the many achievements of Soviet socialism, the system did have many flaws during the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=107.64s)]
*  80s. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=112.4s)]
*  With consumer goods, slow penetration of computer technology, falling productivity, differing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=113.4s)]
*  levels of corruption and the notorious second economy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=118.2s)]
*  Problems extended into the political sphere as well, where overlapping party and state [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=121.92s)]
*  functions reduced local overhead and kept political initiative at the very top. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=125.28s)]
*  Of course, many of these problems arise from a myriad of other issues like the Cold War, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=129.68s)]
*  the relentless economic and other warfare waged by the US against the USSR, and the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=133.56s)]
*  heavy burden of supporting allies abroad. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=137.56s)]
*  The point, however, is that none of these problems were large enough to cause the fall [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=140.12s)]
*  of the Soviet Union. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=143.24s)]
*  They didn't cause crisis, let alone collapse. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=144.24s)]
*  To quote the book, the trouble with this theory is that it views Soviet history as unfolding [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=146.56s)]
*  towards an inevitable demise because of its departures from human nature, private property, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=150.22s)]
*  and the free market. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=154.36s)]
*  Though these views gained ascendancy in the US during the Reagan era, few historians subscribe [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=155.36s)]
*  to a historical determinism based on human nature. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=159.1s)]
*  In addition, this theory is utterly incapable of explaining how Soviet socialism survived [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=162.0s)]
*  the collectivization of agriculture and the German invasion of World War II, only to fall [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  apart under the seemingly far lesser challenges of the 1980s. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=169.36s)]
*  Nothing makes this clearer than Sovietological work from the 1980s, which in full confidence [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=173.62s)]
*  considers the USSR to be a force that's here to stay. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=178.18s)]
*  For a deeper dive, take a look at these two videos here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=181.34s)]
*  The second theory suggests that popular opposition to the Soviet system brought it down. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=186.58s)]
*  Although no one explicitly holds this opinion, it's frequently cited as a major reason. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  They include things like intellectual dissidents, protests, the rise of nationalists, and the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  relative electoral success of non-communist officials in the latter era. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=199.4s)]
*  This line of thinking isn't entirely wrong, as many Soviet economists did favor market [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  reforms, and these opinions influenced that of Gorbachev's. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=207.26s)]
*  Other examples include the Georgian and Azerbaijani protests, the upheaval in the Baltic Republics, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=211.06s)]
*  minor strikes, and the unopposed activity of non-communist officials in high-government [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=215.9s)]
*  positions. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=219.66s)]
*  The problem with this theory is that popular discontent came up towards the end of Gorbachev's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=220.66s)]
*  reforms not before. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=224.22s)]
*  These upheavals occurred in response to Gorbachev's policies. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=225.62s)]
*  In clearer terms, those policies caused these issues. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=228.6s)]
*  In the final analysis, popular opposition acted as a dependent rather than an independent [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=232.1s)]
*  variable, a byproduct of Gorbachev's policies rather than their cause. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  This is further strengthened by the prevalent resistance of the Soviet people against dissolving [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=240.06s)]
*  the Union, as in chapter 6 of this very book. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  Albert Shamansky's work too here is relevant if you're interested in further reading. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=246.58s)]
*  According to the third theory, external factors rooted in the Cold War and the global economy [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=252.38s)]
*  caused the Soviet collapse. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=257.14s)]
*  Extreme opinions even go as far as to say that the betrayal of Soviet socialism was due [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=258.9s)]
*  to the CIA's penetration of Soviet leadership. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=262.3s)]
*  Now the extent of this penetration was far worse than you may realize. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=264.98s)]
*  According to one later report, by 1985 the CIA and FBI had developed the most impressive [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  inventory of spies against Russia in American history, and had riddled the KGB engru, which [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=272.9s)]
*  was the military intelligence, with moles. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=277.82s)]
*  Still, unless further revelation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=280.46s)]
*  Important to note that a lot of the reasons for the collapse of the USSR are not present [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=281.9s)]
*  factors in China as it stands currently. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=288.38s)]
*  shows that Gorbachev or Yakovlev served as CIA agents, it stretches credibility to suppose [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  that the CIA brought down Soviet socialism. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=296.29999999999995s)]
*  Nonetheless, external factors, more powerful than the CIA ever could be, were most definitely [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=298.82s)]
*  at work. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=303.74s)]
*  The intensification of the Cold War in the early 80s, followed by the world recession [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=304.74s)]
*  in 1979 that made American presidents Carter and Reagan increase military spending, caused [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=308.14s)]
*  the Soviet Union to do the same in return. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=312.94s)]
*  To quote the book, Soviet society never enjoyed the luxury of internal development free of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=315.78s)]
*  the threat of outside aggression. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  The cost of defending it related yearly and drained resources away from socially useful [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=321.9s)]
*  domestic investments. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=325.36s)]
*  By 1980, Soviet aid to its allies cost $44 billion a year, and our spending consumed [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  25-30% of the economy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=331.7s)]
*  The strain of the Cold War increased during the late Carter and early Reagan years, the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=334.02s)]
*  doubling of military spending by the US, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the aiding [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=337.58s)]
*  of anti-communists in Afghanistan, Poland and elsewhere, driving down the price of oil [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=343.02s)]
*  and gas on the world market, which was the Soviets' main source of hard currency used [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=346.9s)]
*  for trade, as well as engaging in various forms of economic and psychological warfare. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=350.38s)]
*  Of course, all of these played a significant role, but Francis Fitzgerald provides the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=354.62s)]
*  most persuasive refutation of the supposed decisiveness of Reagan's policies at destabilizing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=358.2s)]
*  the USSR. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=362.62s)]
*  He argues that no clear cause-and-effect relationship existed between the external factors and internal [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=363.86s)]
*  crisis. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=368.58s)]
*  For example, he states that increased US military spending under Reagan, for Star Wars, for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=369.58s)]
*  example, and other projects, didn't increase Soviet military spending directly. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=373.38s)]
*  Many Soviet insiders likewise rejected the idea that the arms race caused either Gorbachev's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=377.26s)]
*  reforms or the collapse. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=381.1s)]
*  A Soviet official in Military Intelligence said, the notion that Gorbachev's perestroika [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=382.46s)]
*  was started as a result of Reagan-Star Wars was concocted in the West and is completely [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=386.38s)]
*  absurd. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=390.42s)]
*  Remember, the Soviet Institute for the USA and Canada said, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=391.42s)]
*  Regardless, all dismisses the point. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  However great in whatever form, the external pressure coming from the United States represented [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=403.02000000000004s)]
*  less of an external threat than earlier economic sanctions, sabotage, and foreign invasion. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=407.1s)]
*  More importantly, the external pressure did not dictate the particular shape and direction [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=411.94s)]
*  of the Soviet response, and the end Gorbachev and similar forces' particular responses [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=416.06s)]
*  to the external pressures and internal problems provided the most decisive cause of the dissolution. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=420.12s)]
*  Back to the video in just a second, let's hear from today's sponsor, Atlas VPN. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  For a lot of research that I do for my videos, I end up hitting pages that aren't even [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=430.32s)]
*  a three-line in the link in the video description. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=433.24s)]
*  A fourth theory is that the cause was a bureaucratic counterrevolution. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=435.16s)]
*  The idea being that the bureaucracy itself became the base for a great capitalist restoration, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=438.76s)]
*  or that transformed itself into a new possessing class. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=446.76s)]
*  This is more or less the arguments of Kotz, Weier, Azad, amongst others, though some in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  this group didn't regard this new group as a class. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=453.6s)]
*  Kotz and Weier argue that the reformed corps launched by Gorbachev unleashed processes [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=456.32000000000005s)]
*  that created new coalitions that favored replacing socialism with capitalism, with Boris Yeltsin [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=460.04s)]

*  Essentially, the argument goes that the breakup of the USSR as a multinational federation [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=475.44s)]
*  occurred because of the specifics of the power struggle between the Yeltsin and Gorbachev [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=479.48s)]
*  forces. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=483.16s)]
*  Yeltsin's anti-socialists held power in Russia, while the Gorbachev Social Reformists held [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=484.16s)]
*  most of the union institutions. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=488.04s)]
*  The Yeltsin forces concluded that they could maintain power and pursue capitalist restoration [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=489.72s)]
*  only by withdrawing Russia from the Soviet Union, hence the USSR fell apart. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=493.76s)]
*  The bureaucratic revolution from above thesis is, however, not completely convincing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=498.68s)]
*  Such officials were, according to the book, incapable of collective action to defend the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=503.44s)]
*  system and incapable of consciously hastening its demise. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=507.3s)]
*  The top bureaucracy, if you can even be said to have enough substance to be judged and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=510.8s)]
*  an authentic social group at all, was too heterogeneous and scattered to act as a cohesive [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=514.44s)]
*  political force. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=518.84s)]
*  Moreover, if the elite was capable of conscious independent action in its own self-interest, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=520.04s)]
*  why did it back Andropov's Marxism and Leninism in 1983, Gorbachev's revisionism in 1987, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=524.52s)]
*  and Yeltsin's free market shock therapy in 1993? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=529.12s)]
*  This discussion is continued in the book. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=531.96s)]
*  Klamenov Zad also supports the thesis that the bureaucratic elite fostered a counter-revolution. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=534.52s)]
*  In his book, he offers a decent history of the accomplishments and limits of Soviet Socialism, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=539.36s)]
*  but argues that the real problems began with Khrushchev. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=543.6s)]
*  The rapid consumption model and wage leveling adopted by the 20th Congress in 1956 sapped [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=546.32s)]
*  production incentives, created shortages, reduced economic growth, and fostered the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=551.32s)]
*  black market and corruption. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=554.6s)]
*  Khrushchev's idea is that the Soviet Union had begun the full-scale building of a communist [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=556.2800000000001s)]
*  The adoption by the 22nd Congress in 1961 of the idea that the Soviet state had become [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=560.96s)]
*  the state of the entire people and the CPSU a party of the entire people signaled a weakening [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=569.96s)]
*  of the party in regards to the state and a growing predominance in the party of intellectuals [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=574.24s)]
*  and bureaucrats. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  In short, Azad argues that the Soviet Union's problems and Gorbachev's policies were the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  aftershocks of the mistaken policies of the Khrushchev era. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  Azad treats the Gorbachev period as a footnote to Khrushchev's mistakes, a part of the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=585.6s)]
*  hiatus of 25 years in failing to implement much-needed changes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=588.92s)]
*  In the view of the authors who wrote the book, the real problem was not the bureaucracy as [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=593.16s)]
*  such but the second economy that corrupted sections of the party and state, fostered [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=596.68s)]
*  a petty bourgeois mentality outside as well as inside the bureaucracy, and turned some [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=600.36s)]
*  bureaucrats along with the second economy and entrepreneurs into a base for Gorbachev's [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=603.86s)]
*  opportunism. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=609.12s)]
*  The fifth theory argues that the Soviet Union collapsed because of a lack of democracy in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=610.16s)]
*  an over-centralized administrative system. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  In essence, a similar view to the first explanation, with the difference being that instead of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=615.74s)]
*  a critical flaw in socialism generally, it's only Soviet-style socialism which can be faulted. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=619.26s)]
*  These types usually claim that the so-called lack of democratic institutions and over-centralization [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  derived either from Stalin or Stalin and Lenin, depending on ideological persuasion. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=628.3s)]
*  This view is widely held by left-social democrats, Eurocommunists, the Demsok crowd, amongst [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=632.38s)]
*  others. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=636.5s)]
*  Historian Stephen F. Cohen and the Soviet writer Roy Medvedev also reflect this view, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=637.5s)]
*  and so do many contemporary communist parties. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=640.86s)]
*  This explanation is superficially attractive as it doesn't require any defense of Soviet [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=643.18s)]
*  socialism. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=646.78s)]
*  To quote the book, to blame the Soviet collapse on a lack of democracy and over-centralization [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=647.92s)]
*  thus serves as a psychological or political distancing mechanism. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=652.18s)]
*  It is a way of asserting that the socialist ideal remains pure and untarnished in spite [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=655.38s)]
*  of what happened in the Soviet Union. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=659.06s)]
*  It says history does not matter. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=660.6999999999999s)]
*  The actual experience of a socialist country does not count. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=662.18s)]
*  The only thing that matters is what we, supposed socialists or communists, say today. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=664.76s)]
*  What happened in the Soviet Union was there and then. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=668.3399999999999s)]
*  This is here and now. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  Those Soviet communists messed up, but we are different and smarter. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=671.62s)]
*  They were too bureaucratic, undemocratic and over-centralized, but we either knew it all [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=674.26s)]
*  along or have learned it from their mistakes. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=678.14s)]
*  As convenient of a view as this is for those who wish to get their time on the next lecture, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=680.74s)]
*  book promotion or media interview, it leaves a lot to be desired as an explanation. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=684.74s)]
*  It's unfalsifiable, has essentially zero explanatory value when applied to real events, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=688.34s)]
*  and lacks so much precision that it cannot be either sufficiently proven nor categorically [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=692.42s)]
*  refuted to the taste of those that hold it as an opinion. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=696.22s)]
*  To say that the Soviet Union collapsed because of a lack of democracy and over-centralization [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=698.98s)]
*  can mean only one of two things. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=702.76s)]
*  Either the collapse occurred because the Soviet Union lacked the political and economic forms [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=704.54s)]
*  and practices familiar in Western social-democratically governed countries like Sweden, i.e. a liberal [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=708.46s)]
*  democracy and a mixed economy, or it occurred because the Soviet Union failed to develop [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=712.46s)]
*  a new kind of socialist democracy and mixed economy hitherto unknown anywhere in the world. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=716.32s)]
*  Both ideas fail as historical explanations because they rest on idealist constructs that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=721.34s)]
*  attempt to explain history by the degree to which it conforms or fails to conform to an [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=725.1s)]
*  ideal. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=728.9s)]
*  Modern historians, Marxists or not, believe that historical explanations must adhere to [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=729.9s)]
*  the actual details and contradictions of history. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=732.62s)]
*  This precludes understanding history by measuring it against some outside standard. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=735.02s)]
*  Furthermore, the strain of thinking, with the Soviet Union collapse because it failed [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=738.66s)]
*  to follow European social-democracy, have another problem to deal with. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=741.62s)]
*  It's clear that after a certain point Gorbachev shared the same ideals as those theorists [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=744.54s)]
*  and tried to move the Soviet Union towards a liberal democracy with a mixed economy. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=748.26s)]
*  Yet, those exact moves are what led to a political and economic meltdown that has still not been [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=751.86s)]
*  overcome. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=755.9399999999999s)]
*  The real has no Pizza Hut and Pepsi is what led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=757.5400000000001s)]
*  For whom and in what form, for example, economic, deepens the nuance but is rarely discussed. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=761.1s)]
*  Referred to the book for this discussion, it's long to render here but it's very good. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=765.3800000000001s)]
*  Regardless, there was an active effort within the USSR from the earliest period to develop [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=769.1s)]
*  ways to increase the participation and control by the workers and peasants of the Soviet [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=773.3000000000001s)]
*  Union. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=777.58s)]
*  The Soviet Union was a very important part of the Soviet Union, and it was a very important [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=778.58s)]
*  to develop ways to increase the participation and control by the workers and peasants, including [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=782.58s)]
*  broadening membership in the Communist Party and developing Soviets, trade unions and other [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=787.74s)]
*  mass organizations. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=791.46s)]
*  Though the process of developing democracy was far from over, the Soviet Union had developed [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=792.46s)]
*  a variety of political institutions and practices designed to provide popular participation. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=796.5s)]
*  The Soviet practices included using newsmen and ombudsmen as well as news sources, besting [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=800.6600000000001s)]
*  trade unions with power over workers' rights, production norms and the disposition of social [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=804.9000000000001s)]

*  To quote the book, though many of these populist institutions atrophied during the difficult [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=820.4200000000001s)]
*  years, they revived in the 1950s and involved greater and greater numbers of working people. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=824.22s)]
*  Even under Brezhnev, popular participation in government showed many signs of vitality. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=828.74s)]
*  Writing in 1978, when the Soviet Union contained 260 million people, a group of Soviet writers [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=832.74s)]
*  gave the following figures on Soviet political activity. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=837.52s)]
*  16.5 million communists, 121 million trade union members, nearly 38 million young communists, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=840.8s)]
*  over 2 million Soviet deputies, 35 million people who work with the deputies and the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=846.36s)]
*  Soviet people's deputies, 9.5 million members of people's control bodies and 5.5 million [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  members of production conferences of industrial enterprises. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=854.6999999999999s)]
*  Of course, participation in a Socialist Soviet, just as participation in a bourgeois election, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=857.92s)]
*  provides no conclusive proof of popular control, but are nonetheless represented however imperfectly [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=862.0s)]
*  the striving for a kind of socialist democracy. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=866.58s)]
*  Many of the traditional Soviet political forms, the newspapers, the Soviets and the Communist [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=869.5s)]
*  Party itself, were undermined by Gorbachev after 1985. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=873.28s)]
*  Thus, while the majority of Soviet people remained opposed to privatization of property, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=876.3s)]
*  the elimination of price controls and the breakup of the Soviet Union, the traditional [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=880.78s)]
*  modes of expressing political views were evaporating. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=884.22s)]
*  What this means is that the lack of democracy theorists could have been right, but definitely [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=887.56s)]
*  not in the way they wanted to be right. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=890.66s)]
*  More on this in my book recommendations video on the topic here. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=892.54s)]
*  The final theory is that the Soviet collapse was mainly due to Gorbachev. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=897.6999999999999s)]
*  Unsurprisingly, almost all accounts give great weight to Gorbachev's role, with some accounts [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=901.0999999999999s)]
*  going further than others. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=904.9s)]
*  According to the British historian Archie Brown, the dissolution of the USSR was greatly [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=906.5s)]
*  determined by a Gorbachev factor, mainly Gorbachev's departure from Communist orthodoxy, painting [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=909.76s)]
*  him as a heroic westernizer of sorts. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=915.3399999999999s)]
*  Jerry Hughes thinks that Gorbachev was a free marketeer. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=917.5s)]
*  Evgeny Novikov and Patrick Batshiyov suggest that Gorbachev was a Gramscian Euro-Communist. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=920.3000000000001s)]
*  Anthony de Agostino argues that Gorbachev was a Machiavellian wanting to maintain power [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=925.02s)]
*  by any means necessary. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=928.7s)]
*  Though the authors of this book agree with the common elements of these views, that Gorbachev's [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=930.02s)]
*  ideological deviations played a key role, they nonetheless disagree with several other [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=935.82s)]
*  elements. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=939.34s)]
*  Accounts that overemphasize Gorbachev obscure the extent to which he was not alone but operated [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=940.34s)]
*  in a historical and social context. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=943.86s)]
*  When he first departed from Andropov, Gorbachev represented ideas that nonetheless had precedent [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=945.4200000000001s)]
*  in the Communist movement, namely in the ideas of Bukharin and Khrushchev. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=949.82s)]
*  These ideas had some appeal in Soviet society. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=953.3000000000001s)]
*  These included the weakening of the central power of the party and the government, legitimizing [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=955.82s)]
*  private property, and allowing more freedom for markets which had potency in the 1980s [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=959.22s)]
*  because they palpably reflected the interests of a dynamic, if parasitic, sector attached [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=963.1400000000001s)]
*  to illegal private enterprise. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=966.9000000000001s)]
*  Thus Gorbachev was both a successor of a certain tradition and the product of his times, not [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=968.94s)]
*  just a lone factor making history. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=972.7800000000001s)]
*  Moreover, for some writers, stressing Gorbachev leads to them seeing his actions as part of [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=974.7s)]
*  a long-standing preconceived plan. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=978.78s)]
*  The evidence, though, seems to point towards a shallow leader who acted rashly, impulsively, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=980.66s)]
*  and contradictorily. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=984.74s)]
*  Though his policies eventually formed a pattern of capitulation to the petty-bourgeois, liberal, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=985.74s)]
*  and corrupt interests at home, and imperialist pressure abroad, this was not evident at the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=989.18s)]
*  start. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=992.86s)]
*  Opportunism was his primary guide. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=993.86s)]
*  In the end, the story of the Soviet collapse was not the inevitable unfolding of a tragedy [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=995.38s)]
*  rooted in the impossibility of socialism, nor was it a defeat brought about by popular [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=999.1s)]
*  opposition or foreign enemies, nor was it due to Soviet socialism's failure to match [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1003.1s)]
*  of socialism that embodied liberal democracy in a mixed economy, nor was it primarily the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1007.68s)]
*  story of the conscious betrayal of one man. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1011.28s)]
*  Rather, it was the story of a triumph of a certain tendency within the revolution itself. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1013.7199999999999s)]
*  It was a tendency first rooted in the peasant nature of the country that later showed up [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1018.16s)]
*  in a second economy, a sector that flourished because of consumer demands unsatisfied by [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1021.76s)]
*  the first economy and because of the failure of its authorities to appreciate the danger [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1026.0s)]
*  it represented and to enforce the law against it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1029.32s)]
*  It was a tendency that [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1032.6000000000001s)]
*  treats, simply put, a lack of robust manufacturing of treats, and then bringing in treats when [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1033.72s)]
*  it's far too late, but only bringing it in in the form of private enterprise and liberalization [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1043.0800000000002s)]
*  of markets. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1049.72s)]
*  That manifested itself in Bukharin and Khrushchev before Gorbachev. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1050.88s)]
*  The treat factor is still important to address. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1053.8000000000002s)]
*  It was a tendency that believed that prosperity, democracy, and its vision of social sacrifice [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  without struggle and without strong central authority. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1060.76s)]
*  It believed in making concessions [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1063.1599999999999s)]
*  of choice is in and of itself a false one because it's like still produced by like eight [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1090.76s)]
*  corporations regardless does not matter. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1096.04s)]
*  The fact that you can get treats, it's is a, is a major contributor to people's defense [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1099.24s)]
*  of capitalism. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1104.7199999999998s)]

*  So you've not heard me say this. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1113.08s)]
*  I've said it quite a bit. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  Treats are an incredible commodity consumption is an incredible mechanism of control. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1117.28s)]
*  An incredible means to sedate the masses in a peaceful fashion. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1122.4s)]
*  And it is a necessity because the government is supposed to do that in order to, to quash [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  any sort of like serious popular uprising. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1133.48s)]

*  You have to make sure that they feel as though their conditions are improving. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1140.32s)]
*  People treats are a fantastic way of doing so. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1144.72s)]
*  As to imperialism, liberalism, private property and the market. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1147.2s)]
*  Some adherents of this tendency believe that they were true socialists, though they allied [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1150.76s)]
*  themselves with others whose truth sympathies were with money making and private property. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1154.0s)]
*  Not until Gorbachev had this tendency in the revolution held full sway and been carried [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1158.08s)]
*  to its logical conclusion. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1161.84s)]
*  Only with Gorbachev was the full mistake of this course realized when it led not to a [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1163.56s)]
*  new kind of socialism, but to a new kind of barbarism to quote the authors. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1167.0s)]
*  In the case of the Soviet Union, Fidel Castro said it best, socialism did not die from natural [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1171.24s)]
*  causes. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftI0Nk5yAM&t=1175.36s)]
