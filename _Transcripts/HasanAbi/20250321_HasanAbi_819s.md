**HasanAbi:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA)

*  Okay, she does he turns around. I'm like, are you Andrew human? He's like, yes, I am and I was like, well, I'm Hassan Hassan piker [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=6.84s)]
*  This is part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news about what's going on in the world of a sauna [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=19.0s)]
*  So now you're piquing between the time period where I press the stop streaming button and press the star streaming button [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  So help me God and a lot has taken place obviously [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=27.9s)]
*  last night last night I ended the broadcast and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  after ending the broadcast I got on a flight and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=37.06s)]
*  On the flight on the flight was another person [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=41.1s)]
*  but [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=46.14s)]
*  Actually, you know what? I'll tell the story in a brief moment [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=47.5s)]
*  Look March and I pack our pack the stuff up pack the remote desktop up and we get to the JSX terminal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  Okay, JSX is the charter flights that they have for that's like basically a little bit more expensive than a normal commercial flight [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=57.26s)]
*  But then you get to not have to deal with an entire [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=65.66s)]
*  Lax situation you can fly into Burbank Airport for rich folk. It's not a real like private jet thing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=69.78s)]
*  It's like a European puddle jumper [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=76.94s)]
*  anyway [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=78.82s)]
*  now the new metaphor me and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=79.34s)]
*  March is that we check the cockpit to make sure that there's at least like a woman or a non-white person in there [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=81.89999999999999s)]

*  Though it's like private is a normal flight [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=107.1s)]
*  It's just it's like a European puddle jumper if you've ever been in a European short-term puddle jumper flight [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=110.14s)]
*  It's you know, anyway, but that's not the point. It is a commercial flight. So we get to the we get to the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=116.06s)]

*  Okay, and then he was and and it was like a like a almost contentious back and forth [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=581.66s)]
*  We were we were now mentally sparring in the marketplace of ideas. He was mr. X. I was mr. Twitter [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=586.96s)]
*  Okay [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=594.62s)]
*  so he he hit it back with is your interview with Bernie Sanders on X and to which I immediately [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=595.54s)]
*  responded with [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=602.9s)]
*  It's on my youtube page [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=604.58s)]
*  But I bet there's some of there's some clips on Twitter and we just kind of did that like a little stand battle [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=606.14s)]
*  You know what? I mean? Like it was a it was a it was one of those [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=613.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of those moments is one of those moments where it was basically like a hold on it was it was like this [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=618.22s)]
*  It was like this. Okay, it was like this we come in [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=624.7s)]
*  I recognize that he's a stand user and in my mind [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=627.26s)]
*  I was thinking like you can always tell when someone is a stand user, right and I said to myself [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=630.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I does it and we just started we just our stands started fighting one another, you know [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=634.9399999999999s)]
*  That was him checking me [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=642.3s)]

*  and [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBfRpjDHMA&t=669.9399999999999s)]
