# Hasan Interviews Brace Belden About Trump's Bust-Up With Zelensky
**HasanAbi:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4)
*  And then he had to like basically run out of the white house. And I know he's been giving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=0.0s)]
*  interviews. What has he been saying in them? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3.22s)]
*  Wait, are you talking about Trump? Are you asking what Zelensky has been saying? So Zelensky [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=5.22s)]
*  this morning came after weeks and weeks of Donald Trump being like, you're a puppet. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=12.74s)]
*  All right. I'm calling brace Belden to make sense of the senseless. Okay. That's right. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=19.34s)]
*  Racial Jake, you know him by many different names. I know him as journalist and also sometimes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=29.299999999999997s)]
*  as friend. He didn't like that last part. Brace Belden, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=38.48s)]
*  Merhaba Hassan. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=43.18s)]
*  Mehmet came out real quick. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=45.18s)]
*  Just for the journalists out there, as of course some people here call them journalists [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=48.18s)]
*  out there, I'm visibly Semitic. And so any kind of criticism that's going to, that you [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=52.86s)]
*  might be thinking during this, you got to squash it now. I've been more times than I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=58.26s)]
*  can count more times than Tony DeCopple. It's you don't think it's, let me ask you, if I'm [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=63.739999999999995s)]
*  wondering, he's the richest man in the world. He's the second most powerful person in the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=71.42s)]
*  United States, arguably the most powerful. He's got a ton of male sons. I think it's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=75.34s)]
*  a fair question to ask if those sons are circumcised. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=82.06s)]
*  Ooh, interesting. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=85.78s)]
*  I think it's fair because the answer is yes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Most likely. But brace, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  thank you so much for coming on now. Initially I wanted to have you on because you are the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=96.5s)]
*  resident liberal expert on a million different things, but most importantly, of course, Jeffrey [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=100.94s)]
*  Epstein, who is someone who tragically took his own life, as you know, on that faithful [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=108.38s)]
*  evening where the Manhattan Correctional Institute seemingly had its cameras go out for [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=117.74s)]
*  the seven and a half minute process where that deed took place and the prison guards [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=127.3s)]
*  were also asleep. Seemingly in that seven and a half minutes is just a freak accident [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=134.06s)]
*  after freak accident after freak accident. As you know, New York financier, Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  Now, initially we were going to talk about that, but something else happened today and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=146.22000000000003s)]
*  it's something that you're also very knowledgeable on as a liberal journalist. It's a, it's a, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=150.02s)]
*  the Zelensky stuff below the below the mirrors. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=157.02s)]
*  He got wrong to sign. I mean, can you believe it? It was crazy. I can. Me too. But that was, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=161.26s)]
*  so here's, I don't know. I haven't, I just got home. So I've not, you know, maybe you've [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=169.7s)]
*  talked about this at length. The JD Vance thing. It's a bit much. No, it's a bit much. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=175.78s)]
*  Like I Trump Trump is Trump can do art of the deal. Yeah. But you get JD in there and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=182.3s)]
*  he's trying to, he's cause he got, he's high on getting praise for going to Munich and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=188.94s)]
*  like talking to shit. And so he's trying to do a Munich too, by being like, and another [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=192.34s)]
*  thing you got to say thank you to Donald Trump. Yeah. That was, that was, I mean, this is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=197.86s)]
*  it. This is, yeah. I'm showing it to you as well. What I'm looking at on screen. Have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  you said thank you once? He's so sick. He's so sick. He's so cool. He's so, that Usha [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=207.66s)]
*  have you said thank you? Yeah. Usha is quaking when, when she thinks about how much of an [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=216.1s)]
*  alpha dog, but also millennial coded JD Vance's. I've got it. I've been, I've been wondering [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=223.1s)]
*  and I've, I've for a long time, I thought Huma Abedin was the most beautiful South Asian [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=229.5s)]
*  powerful woman in the world. I've heard you say this before. I don't disagree with you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=237.7s)]
*  I, she is in a watch that wiener documentary pause that is, is, is she is looking gorgeous [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  in that even Gray's under fire. I would say that Gray's under fire. Now she's with this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=248.54s)]
*  dweeb Alex Soros, who is, he looks like shit. Whoa, whoa. Do not disrespect. This is Greg [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=252.94s)]
*  Alex Soros, who I follow on Instagram for many, many years. This broadcast. Thank you, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  Alex Soros. I'm like, I got to do an MPR hit, you know, when they do a Facebook, when they [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=265.58s)]
*  do like a Facebook story. And then they're like, we must, we must tell you that Facebook [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=270.26s)]
*  is a contributor to the broadcast. Alex Soros is a contributor to the broadcast. Very important [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=274.1s)]
*  third tier three subscriber constantly gifts a lot of subscriptions. Thank you, Alex. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=279.3s)]
*  Alex, if you are watching, you need to open up the relationship and get me in there. You [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  need to open that thing up. I got to get in there. I love Huma. He's just jealous. He [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=292.02000000000004s)]
*  wants to be Polly with you, Alex. But, but I will say, I thought Huma was my number one. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=297.18s)]
*  I was like, okay, you know, wow. And then Usha comes along and I'm like, JD, where have [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=304.18s)]
*  you been hiding her? Because she is gorgeous and ugly. Let's be honest. I'm not good looking [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=311.62s)]
*  myself. So, you know, I'm not trying to be like, but he's, he's, he's kind of, there's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=318.62s)]
*  something wrong with him. You know? Yeah. Like it's this, it's not right. You know what [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=325.14s)]
*  I'm saying? It's not right. And I think that Usha, whatever the situation is, if you need [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=330.41999999999996s)]
*  to be freed or whatever, if you want to come with Huma, I can get you, but he should send [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  this to her every time that she's mad at him for like working late. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=340.5s)]
*  I think, I think JD wanted to be closer to being a South Asian man. And that's why he [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=344.82s)]
*  more eyeliner than a, than a posh tune Taliban member. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=349.66s)]
*  He does look like a bot. He is Trump's baka Bazzi. He's his dancing boy. And it's, it's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=355.94s)]
*  horrible. Peter Thiel. That's what he did for Peter Thiel. So I know it's, it's great. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=360.02000000000004s)]
*  He does. He's, he's got like, he's, he's got like the, the second in command, like the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=364.86s)]
*  lieutenant thing going on. But I think that what he did, I don't, you know, Zelensky and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=370.5s)]
*  I have had our differences. But what I think he did was, was, was a cautionary thing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=374.78s)]
*  Sorry. Just we have, we have a difference. I would have, you know, done things. But, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=381.78s)]
*  but I, I felt, I felt a twinge of pity for Zelensky. And I've, I've vacillated because [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=387.38s)]
*  I felt pity for Zelensky when he first got in, because he was, you know, he was, he looked [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=393.73999999999995s)]
*  like he was going to be the peacemaker. I do think he tried. I think that, that nothing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=398.58s)]
*  really could have, he was kind of getting it from both sides on that. Like, you know, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=403.66s)]
*  there was no way that was going to happen. And he kind of came into his own. But this, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=409.66s)]
*  I mean, the reality is I don't really know what the argument is against what Trump's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=414.82000000000005s)]
*  saying because like they don't have any cards. Ukraine is losing the war. They've been losing [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=418.62s)]
*  the war for a while. And it's sort of hard to like, there's no, like there's, there hasn't [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=423.42s)]
*  been, especially from like all the Europeans who like really have stuck their necks out [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=430.70000000000005s)]
*  on this or stuck their necks out as the word, but like have, well, the Europeans have stuck [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  with Zelensky for the most part. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=440.18s)]
*  And my favorite, not to go you all, but my favorite was when Keir Starmer, also known [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  as Keir Stalin came out and was like, Oh, we're going to send our, our, our shorts wearing, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=447.02000000000004s)]
*  you know, 14,000 strong special forces into Ukraine. And then very quickly, almost immediately [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=455.34s)]
*  after he said that, but without American security cooperation assurances, this will be meaningless. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=461.9s)]
*  That was, that was the extent, like even McCrone, the, the Jupiterian figure, the, the real [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=469.02s)]
*  Lord of Europe, even he has had like, he he's been positively Polish in the way that he [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=477.22s)]
*  has talked about Ukraine. He behaves like he's, you know, a part of the Polish parliament [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=484.06s)]
*  or something where he's always like, we're going to send the most military troops to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=488.94s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=493.54s)]
*  And he's been saying it for months, like way before, way before Keir Starmer ever came [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=494.54s)]
*  out and said things like that. So I don't know, I just don't see that being a real [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=499.62s)]
*  alternative if there is no more American security assurances coming down the line. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=507.22s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, what I thought was going to happen was that there was going to be some [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=513.22s)]
*  kind of, kind of like weird deal with the DMZ that's like manned by, you know, whatever [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=517.98s)]
*  Russian and allied troops on one side and, or a weird security agreement with like French [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=523.74s)]
*  troops or British troops there. Now, I'm not really so sure because the thing is like the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=529.9s)]
*  U S kind of with Nord Stream and with a lot of pressure on the Germans, like have really [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=536.5s)]
*  altered Europe's economy in a major way in the past four years. And this is just like [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=542.3s)]
*  a complete reversal. I mean, I honestly, it's today has been a crazy one because I, you [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=549.1s)]
*  know, I assumed there would be some hard bargaining, some, you know, tough words and maybe some [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=554.74s)]
*  tough love, but they just like, they sh***** him. And then he had to like basically run [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=558.9s)]
*  out of the white house. And I know he's been giving interviews. What has he been saying [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=563.86s)]
*  in them? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=566.66s)]
*  Wait, are you talking about Trump? Are you asking what Zelensky has been saying? So Zelensky [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=567.66s)]
*  this morning came after weeks and weeks of Donald Trump being like, you're a puppet, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=575.14s)]
*  your comedy ain't s**t. Your b**ch ain't bad. You know, you're a dictator. Yeah. Yeah. You're [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  woke. You're woken and trans and DEI or worse than all of those slurs in the Republican [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=586.86s)]
*  side of the conversation. He said you're a Democrat, right? Which is a liberal, you know, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=594.42s)]
*  just like the worst thing you can be. So he kept saying all that. But then Zelensky, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=601.34s)]
*  of course, after Donald Trump met with all the European leaders and Modi turned around [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=606.82s)]
*  and came to sign this mineral deal that he initially said he wasn't going to sign the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=612.14s)]
*  same mineral deal from what I understand the Biden administration was trying to get him [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=617.14s)]
*  to sign to begin with, but more quietly and because, you know, they're just that good [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=620.86s)]
*  at doing foreign policy. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=628.2s)]
*  Real player moves in silence. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=630.62s)]
*  Exactly. And, and he was ready to sign this deal. But I think in the process, like JD [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=632.14s)]
*  Vance goaded him. Like, I mean, he got, he was, he just sat there and had to take like [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=638.8199999999999s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Green's boyfriend, the really drunk looking guy who just looks like he [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=644.42s)]
*  has insanely high blood pressure. You know, I'm talking about from OAN. I think he's on [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=649.62s)]
*  Newsmax or OAN, whatever his name is. But he was like, what are you wear a suit ever? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=655.5400000000001s)]
*  Which is a question that's on everyone's mind. Certainly. But like time and place. Right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=660.62s)]
*  And he had to basically sit there and eat it from not just like the peanut gallery, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=665.3000000000001s)]
*  but from a guy who was a commentator on right side broadcasting network. It's like having [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=670.4200000000001s)]
*  an epoch times guy shit on you. You know what I mean? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=678.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. No, I love that. I've encountered them many times. That they're like, I don't [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=682.5s)]
*  even know if they're a news network. Aren't they just like a live stream thing? That's [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=689.26s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's like me being in the room for Joe Biden. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=692.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I will say that the Republicans always fixate on Zelensky wearing a suit. And the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=697.22s)]
*  reality is, is Zelensky is diminutive, right? Like he's short. He's like five to Lily Puchin. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=703.62s)]
*  Lily Puchin? The guy from Gulliver's, the little men. And if you wear a suit and you're short, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=709.38s)]
*  you really run the risk of looking like a child. And so I actually understand the choice [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=715.3s)]
*  not to do that. I think it's a tough one. And I think he made the right one in wearing [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=719.9s)]
*  his little uniform kind of thing. Yeah. It is. I mean, I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=725.54s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's the thing is, is a lot that a lot's gone down in the past couple [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=732.98s)]
*  months that has given me a bit of a raised eyebrow. And I, I was expecting this to like [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=736.86s)]
*  end in some crazy up mineral deal that Ukraine signs and we get like all their rare earth [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=745.58s)]
*  minerals, which I wasn't even aware that they really had that many. Yeah. And I mean, who [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=751.02s)]
*  knows? I don't know. The only thing I've seen is like some USSR mineral maps that they've [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=755.86s)]
*  had that they've retained seemingly. Amazing. Amazing. But now it looks like Zelensky left [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=760.7s)]
*  the white house in a huff or was, was unceremoniously kicked out. No, no, he was kicked out. And [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=767.9000000000001s)]
*  so dude, you don't want to get kicked out of the white house. No, no, you don't. So [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=772.38s)]
*  the question remains for me is, and there's a lot of people who are very mad at me because [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=778.86s)]
*  I said, what did I hold on? Let me see if I can find this and pull up this tweet. But [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=783.62s)]
*  a lot of liberals are always mad at me. The war. Yeah. That's yeah. That's okay. That [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=789.78s)]
*  was in private that I told you. Okay. And you agreed and you were like, yes, Russia [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=795.14s)]
*  is based. Yeah. You were like, Russia is based. We are saddened by, we are saddened by the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=799.62s)]
*  tactical retreat that the brave Russian soldiers had to make. They needed that warm water port [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=806.48s)]
*  in Syria, you know, anyway. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=812.26s)]
*  Yeah. I said, I said there's literally nothing Zelensky can do that would stop Trump and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=816.58s)]
*  his admin from humiliating him. Obviously our proxies are always powerless in these [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=821.26s)]
*  circumstances, but the decorum is totally broken. No care for diplomacy. The end of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  American soft power. And I think that's what's going on in general with like, you know, gutting [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=828.6600000000001s)]
*  the USAID and, and basically, or trying to centralize it under the state department as [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=833.9200000000001s)]
*  though they were like acting as a, as a cutout for like democratic party NGOs or something. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=839.6600000000001s)]
*  I think they like greatly misunderstand what USAID was doing. Yes, I agree with that. And [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=844.5s)]
*  also, simultaneously, I think like they're just moving in the direction of no more carrot, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=851.86s)]
*  just stick, except for Israel, obviously, but Israel is more so an extension of the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=856.7s)]
*  United States. So we don't talk about that as different. But this person calling Ukraine [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=860.7s)]
*  a proxy is insane, dude. So what do you think about all of this with your, you know, with [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=865.46s)]
*  your understanding of the situation? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=872.78s)]
*  I think from what I can gather, I mean, I don't really know how much, how many cards Ukraine [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=875.02s)]
*  has without the US to sort of to paraphrase Trump there. I mean, there is there is a real [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=880.06s)]
*  question of like, what the fuck they're going to do if America cuts off arms, because the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=886.86s)]
*  European arms industry is not caught up yet. That's like a like a decades long fucking [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=891.14s)]
*  thing they got to do. And yeah, the reality is, is like they function in this sense as a [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=895.3399999999999s)]
*  proxy. I don't think that's like, I don't think that's really that controversial of a [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=901.14s)]
*  thing to say. I mean, it's not even like a moral judgment or anything like that. Like, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=904.34s)]
*  they're fighting this war with like American support, targeting troops on the ground, some [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=908.02s)]
*  reported some not huge amounts, hundreds of billions of dollars. And yes, a lot of that [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=914.06s)]
*  money is spent on US weapons, which is a racket. But but I don't really know how to read [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=920.18s)]
*  that. I mean, they could not win this war. Or this war would would almost certainly be [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=926.66s)]
*  over in some way or another. If the US had not gotten involved to the extent that it [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=930.3s)]
*  did. I mean, it's just it seems I wasn't even aware that that was really a controversial [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=934.8199999999999s)]
*  thing to say outside of like, you know, Ukrainian nationalist circles or anything like that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=940.3399999999999s)]
*  No liberals, liberals outflank Ukrainian nationals in many respects on this issue. So [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=944.2199999999999s)]
*  especially because like, they don't really lose anything in terms of just, you know, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=949.5799999999999s)]
*  throwing up the flag. But I don't know, maybe this is just a misunderstanding. But the reason [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  why I brought this up is not to like go over petty grievances with like the account called [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=959.4599999999999s)]
*  polling USA. The reason why I brought it up is because I want you to speculate on like [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=965.0999999999999s)]
*  what you think Zelensky has in his pocket. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=973.14s)]
*  Like what? Because I did genuinely think that he would play ball and maybe even grovel [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=977.66s)]
*  further on Brett Baer and earlier. And I know you were watching this as well. He did [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=984.18s)]
*  not do that. Brett Baer actually baited him multiple times to be like, well, you're not [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=990.18s)]
*  actually doing that. You're not actually apologizing to Donald Trump. And he instead [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=993.9s)]
*  delivered what I consider to be a relatively heartfelt and somewhat sincere plea to the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1000.9s)]
*  American population and specifically Donald Trump's base of support. And I don't know why [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1009.66s)]
*  he thought that. Is it foolishness? Does he think that like Americans give a shit? Does he [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1017.58s)]
*  think that like MAGA can listen to reason? Does he know something that we don't know? Or is [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1022.34s)]
*  Macron actually going to use nuclear first strike capabilities against Russia if Russia further [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1028.06s)]
*  undermines Ukrainian sovereignty? Like, what does he know? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1034.26s)]
*  I mean, it's funny if he thinks that like he'll sway a majority of the MAGA movement or even [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1037.86s)]
*  like a significant minority, I think he is out of his fucking mind because they hate his [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1043.58s)]
*  ass. They're like, he's gay. He's doing trans stuff in Ukraine. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1049.02s)]
*  Like, I think it's hard maybe for like a non-American to understand like how a lot of [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1053.02s)]
*  MAGA types kind of like they have like chibolets or like images that they just like have these [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1059.62s)]
*  insane sort of like mythos or stories around. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1065.1000000000001s)]
*  And like Zelensky is absolutely one of the main ones. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1068.06s)]
*  I mean, it's like he's this, you know, he's sort of like the I guess like what when people [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1071.06s)]
*  think of like wasteful foreign aid or like Democrats stealing money or like Hunter Biden or [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1079.3s)]
*  anything like that, when MAGA people think of that stuff, it kind of all comes down and [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1083.42s)]
*  funnels down to Zelensky himself. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1086.94s)]
*  Yeah. And he is not a sympathetic figure to a lot of Republicans. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1088.98s)]
*  Maybe some like GOP conservative types. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1093.54s)]
*  And it's so funny because like Lindsey Graham, like Lindsey. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1096.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But Lindsey Graham flipped. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1099.34s)]
*  Yeah. And he dropped them. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1101.18s)]
*  He dropped them like like a bad habit after basically goading him for years and years and [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1102.82s)]
*  being like, it's great that all Ukrainians are dying with dying using our older weaponry [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1107.6599999999999s)]
*  that we shipped over there. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1114.26s)]
*  Yes. I mean, and boy, it's just whatever. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1116.5s)]
*  Maybe maybe Zelensky, if you have the tapes of Lindsey Graham and 16 year old boys in [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1120.98s)]
*  Northern Virginia hotel rooms to release them now. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1126.66s)]
*  I do think that it's just it's what you said earlier about like soft power sort of like [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1130.78s)]
*  going out the window. I think that's like a really I think it's like kind of true about [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1137.46s)]
*  like everything about the new the new Trump regime is that in that like a lot of what [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1141.42s)]
*  they're doing, like the sort of looting or like the the cutting away the regulations with [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1147.22s)]
*  doggy and all of the like foreign policy sort of like tough guy shit. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1151.54s)]
*  It really is just like a way of doing what the US has done for a long time without any [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1155.98s)]
*  of the niceties and without any of the bullshit. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1161.42s)]
*  You know, like I'm just kind of getting down to business here in a way that would like [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1163.54s)]
*  take other administrations maybe like like five, ten years to do because they have to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1167.7s)]
*  funnel this through this and this through this and get this guy elected and do this. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1172.74s)]
*  But I think there's like purpose for that. Right. Like that's the reason why you have to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1176.06s)]
*  manufacture. You have to do that to like try and maintain this idea around the world that [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1180.02s)]
*  America is like sometimes doing bad things. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1188.86s)]
*  But like they're doing it for a greater good because America is the world police. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1191.82s)]
*  And and I think Israel accelerated the lie right. Yeah. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1196.02s)]
*  Right after Ukraine because like Israel and Ukraine happening so close to one another [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1200.62s)]
*  like really showed the moral depravity to even people in Western Europe that were previously, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1204.74s)]
*  in my opinion, oblivious to it for or strategically ambiguous to it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1213.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes. And and and now it's it's obvious that like nobody gives a shit about the international [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1219.14s)]
*  rule based order. That's not a real thing. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1226.3400000000001s)]
*  But having said that, I still didn't think Trump would dismantle that soft power apparatus so [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1228.94s)]
*  quickly. Yeah, it's funny because for a sec I was like maybe they'll use it like how, for [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1237.6599999999999s)]
*  instance, like Germany, they give money to political parties and they have these overseas [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1243.54s)]
*  offices. And so like AFD, for instance, like has offices in other countries. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1248.26s)]
*  I think they do. But like the Conservative Party, the Social Democrats do. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1252.6599999999999s)]
*  And I was like, OK, well, maybe they'll use this in like a based way and they'll just like give [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1256.98s)]
*  their like support or like use soft power as like muscle behind whatever, you know, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1261.6200000000001s)]
*  Orban like candidate they can find anywhere. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1266.8600000000001s)]
*  But I mean, again, it's been like a month and a half. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1268.94s)]
*  So who knows? Two months. No, like a month, actually. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1271.74s)]
*  But but that could still happen. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1276.18s)]
*  It's just it seems like I don't know. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1278.6200000000001s)]
*  Everything's still so in the fucking air right now with all like the cuts and like the [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1281.82s)]
*  fake cuts and the like moving shit around the state that like I actually have no idea. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1286.14s)]
*  There's so much confusion that like I have no idea what they'll retain. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1290.74s)]
*  And like it could be that they're doing the doggy thing of like strip it all away and [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1294.42s)]
*  then like put some back that you think you actually turns out that you need. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1298.3400000000001s)]
*  And that could come in there. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1301.7s)]
*  It's funny, though, because like, again, they come back to this like, you know, Ukraine [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1303.7800000000002s)]
*  would be like cause celeb or whatever among Republicans 30 years ago, 40 years ago. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1309.0600000000002s)]
*  You know, I mean, we would have like, I mean, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1314.26s)]
*  Azov guys would be like giving speeches at Congress. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1317.34s)]
*  Although they have visited Congress, it's been under the aegis of the liberals. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1320.94s)]
*  And so it's so funny to see all this shit. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1324.38s)]
*  I mean, that's talk about a realignment. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1326.5s)]
*  You know, it's it's sort of amazing. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1328.34s)]
*  And it's funny because I think a lot of Democrats kind of lean into it [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1330.3s)]
*  because now it's almost seen as like an act of resistance against the nationalist [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1332.94s)]
*  GOP to to to just be, you know, doing as much [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1338.22s)]
*  foreign entanglement as possible. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1343.0200000000002s)]
*  Part of this also could just be like pivot to China stuff. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1345.98s)]
*  But then also, I that's all in confusion now, too. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1348.2600000000002s)]
*  So I have no idea. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1351.46s)]
*  Well, that's what I I think like the Vivek Ramaswamy foreign policy [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1352.8200000000002s)]
*  method that Tucker Carlson and like a select few redditors were talking about [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1357.7s)]
*  before the Trump administration of decoupling Russia from China [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1362.8200000000002s)]
*  and then focusing all of our efforts on going to war with China is [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1368.18s)]
*  seemingly what this administration is moving in the direction of, it seems like. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1372.06s)]
*  But I I'm not saying that this will be successful. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1376.74s)]
*  I just think that that is kind of [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1379.74s)]
*  the direction that they're taking, it seems. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1382.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that occurred to me as well, because like, you know, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1385.9799999999998s)]
*  the Russia China maximum friendship thing that they're doing. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1389.06s)]
*  I could see that, but I just don't really see that really working. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1393.5s)]
*  And also, like. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1396.58s)]
*  Hey, these people are so fucking crazy and stupid that, like, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1398.54s)]
*  sometimes I feel like I try to like ascribe the motivations or plans [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1402.74s)]
*  that like aren't actually there because I'm like, well, if I was doing this, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1406.8200000000002s)]
*  this would be the reason I would be doing it, because I'm like, you know, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1410.18s)]
*  a little canny or whatever. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1414.1000000000001s)]
*  But like a lot of the times, I think it's like purely like, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1415.54s)]
*  I don't know what Trump is talking about half the fucking time. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1418.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think he tries to do like a like a hard negotiating shit. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1421.3000000000002s)]
*  Like I think sending Vance to Europe was part of that. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1424.26s)]
*  I think like I think some of the shit he was saying to the Zalensky [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1426.74s)]
*  was part of that, but then also like, you know, he's a fickle individual. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1429.54s)]
*  And so he could have gotten [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1433.02s)]
*  it gotten genuinely offended. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1435.18s)]
*  It's weird because like, I mean, listen, again, me and Zalensky [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1436.78s)]
*  had a long big falling out recently with the past few years. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1440.18s)]
*  I don't. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1445.54s)]
*  I don't think he was being that disrespectful. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1447.6200000000001s)]
*  He was so like, no, I'm like, you know, listen, he's ESL. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1449.6200000000001s)]
*  What's the let me we are to be fair, we're both libs in this new administration. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1454.26s)]
*  Yeah, and we and that's the thing is, is, is, is we are liberal. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1458.1399999999999s)]
*  We are. We are liberals. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1462.8999999999999s)]
*  We do like the Democratic Party. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1464.34s)]
*  And I think that, you know, Andrew Cuomo is great. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1466.3799999999999s)]
*  And he's going to hopefully get a leadership role. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1470.86s)]
*  I know, you know, a lot of people have been calling me liberal Hitler lately, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1473.8999999999999s)]
*  which I don't is not a title I accept. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1477.4199999999998s)]
*  It's just what they call me. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1479.1799999999998s)]
*  Cuomo is coming from my crown. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1480.3s)]
*  And let me tell you, just one look at that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1482.1s)]
*  You know, you can look at a guy sometimes me like there's more allegations out there. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1484.26s)]
*  I know it. I know it happens, frankly, in your industry. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1487.4599999999998s)]
*  You probably have to do that. You see that all the time. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1491.2199999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1492.8999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, one of my one of my favorite liberals recently got taken out. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1493.54s)]
*  I don't know if you know him. His name is Destiny. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1499.06s)]
*  You know, I was very sad as a liberal. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1501.62s)]
*  I was very sad. I still defend him, of course, vociferously because my God is. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1503.4199999999998s)]
*  And it's a shame, too, because that body being out of circulation now, I mean, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1508.9s)]
*  OK, well, there goes my experiments with bisexuality. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1515.5400000000002s)]
*  Guess I'm not doing that anymore. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1518.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1519.94s)]
*  But but but yeah, I [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1521.5400000000002s)]
*  Cuomo, what? Oh, no. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1526.02s)]
*  Liberal JD Vance, Ukraine. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1527.18s)]
*  Duff, we know liberal Hitler, liberal Hitler. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1528.74s)]
*  I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you right now. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1532.42s)]
*  I think that I think that that that JD Vance is a is a loose cannon [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1534.58s)]
*  and they got to lock his ass in the basement and give usha to me. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1539.46s)]
*  But I think that. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1544.54s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1547.1799999999998s)]
*  I it's I think that they're just going crazy. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1547.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean, what they're doing is they're [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1550.74s)]
*  they're just really trying to. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1553.5s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out how to phrase this. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1555.6999999999998s)]
*  I thought about this a lot earlier, but it's almost like they're just [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1557.82s)]
*  reorienting like their policy on this, like lean tech line [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1560.78s)]
*  where it's like you can just do whatever you want and like you can break this rule [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1565.6200000000001s)]
*  and that rule and this rule and that rule. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1568.46s)]
*  And it does sort of like seem like it jibes with a lot of kind of [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1570.06s)]
*  what's going on globally. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1573.94s)]
*  When the fucking Syria fell in like a week. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1575.22s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like all institutions are basically the Assad government right now. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1578.1s)]
*  Like everything's the bath party and like is can fall apart [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1583.06s)]
*  with like one blitzkrieg strike from from a crazy guy. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1587.02s)]
*  Well, I mean, to be fair, there was our the goat [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1590.1s)]
*  who was really playing all sides behind closed doors on that one. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1595.1s)]
*  He was and did you see that you see that they trotted out Ojalon today? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1600.62s)]
*  Yeah. Or yesterday. Yeah. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1605.3799999999999s)]
*  But that's your that's your homie. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1607.1399999999999s)]
*  That's big dog. What's happening? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1608.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean, I mean, he was I the statement, frankly, is nonsense. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1610.34s)]
*  And I talked to a lot of people and everyone's like, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1614.5s)]
*  I think everyone's just ignoring it. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1617.1799999999998s)]
*  Like he doesn't really have like I mean, he's been out of the picture [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1618.62s)]
*  for like 35 years now in terms of like strategic orientation. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1622.62s)]
*  You're saying he's got no motion. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1626.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think he's got many. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1628.3s)]
*  I don't think he's got a lot of motion. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1629.78s)]
*  And I know I think he's trying to I think Ardoin. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1631.3799999999999s)]
*  This is my we will we will speculation alert. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1635.7399999999998s)]
*  OK, I don't know. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1638.4599999999998s)]
*  But I think that they're perhaps maybe a little worried about like [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1640.3s)]
*  like an Israel style Kurdistan approach that might happen in this like [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1644.98s)]
*  very new territory that we're approaching with Middle Eastern politics. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1650.1000000000001s)]
*  So instead, they want to get ahead of that by being like, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1654.5800000000002s)]
*  see this guy that we imprisoned for 35 years. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1657.8600000000001s)]

*  And it'll be like a regional actor that is beholden to us, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1665.46s)]
*  the Turkish government, rather than like an Israel style ethnostate. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1670.26s)]
*  Which I don't even know if I would ever, you know, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1675.14s)]
*  I don't know if they could do that. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1677.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the the the Syrian Kurds came out yesterday [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1680.5400000000002s)]
*  were like, actually, what he said doesn't apply to us. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1684.14s)]
*  So we're not doing that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1686.3000000000002s)]
*  But I don't know, it seemed it seemed it got a rather muted [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1689.26s)]
*  response from people I talked to who who know a lot more than me [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1692.3400000000001s)]

*  They're just like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1696.38s)]
*  He's fucking like old as fuck now and not. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1697.42s)]

*  because we can't have the missile systems and the same fucking, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1743.54s)]
*  you know, and NATO, NATO planes on the same grid, I guess, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=1748.02s)]

*  get to the bottom of this is what I'm saying. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2386.0600000000004s)]
*  You know, I just we got it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2389.2200000000003s)]
*  We got it. We got it. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2390.9s)]
*  We got to see what's going on here. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2392.5s)]
*  Is there another angle perhaps? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2394.34s)]
*  Yeah, no, I respect that. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2396.14s)]
*  That's that's the mark of a true journalist wanting to investigate further. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2398.62s)]
*  Is there another? Well, people know and I've talked about before, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2403.78s)]
*  I'm the number one investigator of Elon Musk penis in the world. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2406.42s)]
*  And so why can't I see fucking Marco Rubio's front picture? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2409.6600000000003s)]
*  Just let me show me the front at the foam party. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2413.62s)]
*  Yeah, I feel that. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2415.94s)]
*  What is this in his memoir? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2418.14s)]
*  Rubio recounts the relationship with his wife, Jeanette, and how she wants [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2419.46s)]
*  starting to break up with him. If he went to a phone party, he went anyway, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2422.34s)]
*  but had an epiphany in the foam. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2425.02s)]
*  As I contemplated my predicament, I looked down at my shoes. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2427.42s)]
*  They were perfectly white. They had been black when I arrived, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2429.98s)]
*  maybe because I took it as a sign. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2432.66s)]
*  The life I was leading was phony and unsustainable. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2434.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God. He's talking about being gay. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2437.66s)]
*  And I suddenly found myself wearing white shoes, a South Beach fashion faux pas. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2439.66s)]
*  I left the club and found the nearest pay phone. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2443.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2446.06s)]
*  Your wife is like, don't go to the phone party. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2448.22s)]
*  And you're like, I'm going to the phone party. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2450.78s)]
*  I'm going to the phone. Crazy. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2454.86s)]
*  He just loves that. He's a foamer. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2457.1s)]
*  Could you imagine if the woman you love was like, don't go to the phone party. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2459.86s)]
*  And like, you're like, fuck you. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2462.9s)]
*  Fuck you. I'm going to the party. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2464.94s)]
*  Yeah. You know what would happen in that situation? OK. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2467.34s)]
*  She would no longer be the woman that I love. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2470.86s)]
*  OK, she needs to understand that I'm going to foam. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2473.1s)]
*  I'm going to go with the fucking boys. OK, do they have? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2476.54s)]
*  Have you ever encountered this in your life? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2479.8599999999997s)]
*  I've never heard of one of these. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2481.58s)]
*  I think like they used to throw. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2483.18s)]
*  I I feel like I went to like a rave or something, maybe with foam [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2485.06s)]
*  like way back in the day. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2490.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it could have been like the July weekend at [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2492.3399999999997s)]
*  in Las Vegas or something, though. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2495.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that seems like that kind of thing there. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2498.14s)]
*  I'm just like, I feel like now with cell phones, it'd be tough. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2500.66s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2505.5800000000004s)]
*  But OK, getting back on track, we sidestepped here about [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2507.1800000000003s)]
*  which conservative figures are the most fuckable. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2511.26s)]
*  And I guess like the last thing I want to ask you about Zalensky, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2515.7400000000002s)]
*  I was about to call him Zell Disney again. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2519.86s)]
*  And after today, it's no longer Zell Disney. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2521.42s)]
*  He he took a strong stance on Brett Baer. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2523.7000000000003s)]
*  And he basically said, no, no, I am not going to apologize. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2527.54s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2531.38s)]
*  The voice is amazing. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2533.54s)]
*  Yeah. He was he was behaving in a very based, quote unquote, based manner. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2537.06s)]
*  But I guess the question that I have is, what the fuck does he have [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2542.3799999999997s)]
*  that he knows that like, does he truly think that European allegiances [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2547.5s)]
*  without American security assurances will will defend Ukraine will be enough [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2553.1s)]
*  to defend Ukraine, even when they're under like [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2557.8999999999996s)]
*  genuinely going through a manpower problem? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2562.1s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's tough. I mean. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2565.58s)]
*  No, you know, I mean, I think that Ukraine kind of hit on [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2570.02s)]
*  like a sort of smart thing to do, which was just terror. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2573.7400000000002s)]
*  And and they've been they've been sort of employing that [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2576.7000000000003s)]
*  for like the past year, but like I don't mean like terror. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2579.94s)]
*  Well, I do, actually. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2582.1800000000003s)]
*  But they've been employing that for like the past more than a year, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2583.46s)]
*  than like two or three years. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2586.9s)]
*  I would have predicted that it would go like more in that direction [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2589.3s)]
*  once the land war gets a little more. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2592.54s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty pretty static for a little while now, but like [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2594.94s)]
*  once lines like really entrenched. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2598.1800000000003s)]
*  But I have no idea. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2599.9s)]
*  I mean, we're getting to spring. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2600.94s)]
*  Who knows if the Russians are going to rock again in spring [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2602.46s)]
*  and take a bunch of territory. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2604.98s)]
*  I have a feeling that he will probably take whatever deal [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2607.1400000000003s)]
*  and then get assassinated by somebody. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2610.26s)]
*  But he is not long, I think, for the the [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2612.46s)]
*  presidency of Ukraine. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2616.78s)]
*  But me saying that, by the way, to anyone listening, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2617.82s)]
*  I cannot make predictions and Hassan is making me do this. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2621.42s)]
*  And I'm everything I would say right now. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2625.1000000000004s)]
*  The opposite is going to be true. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2626.5s)]
*  Oh, me too. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2627.98s)]
*  Famously, I also said Russia will never invade. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2629.34s)]
*  I know. And thank God you said that, because that made me reassess a lot of my life. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2632.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm like, how was I wrong? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2636.86s)]
*  And then I realized I was wrong just because my heuristic of disbelief [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2637.82s)]
*  in the State Department, ninety nine, one hundred percent of the time. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2641.3s)]
*  I need to just do it. Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the time. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2644.5s)]
*  But no, no, we don't know that we everyone went through that exact same. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2647.1s)]
*  Everyone went through that exact same situation, especially because like [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2652.5s)]
*  Ukrainians on the ground were like, they're not going to invade. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2654.94s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2657.86s)]
*  So I was like, no, it's not going to happen. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2658.78s)]
*  And I believe the let's I feel and now I'm back. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2662.3s)]
*  I'm back to pity Zelensky because I feel I feel bad for the guy. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2665.1400000000003s)]
*  But I think that I have no idea. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2668.26s)]
*  I have no idea. It's who fucking knows, because like, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2671.6600000000003s)]
*  anyway, and the reality is like, yeah, they have like equipment shortages, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2675.2200000000003s)]
*  but like they do have equipment. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2678.3s)]
*  The only problem is, is like, first of all, they don't have air [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2680.42s)]
*  in any appreciable way. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2683.9s)]
*  And who knows what the fuck is going to happen to their air now [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2685.7000000000003s)]
*  if we're going to cut off aid, because like we've given them planes. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2687.6600000000003s)]
*  But like, are we still training the pilots? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2690.38s)]
*  Yeah. In Poland, too, which is in Poland. Yeah. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2692.6200000000003s)]
*  And there's just like there's a very real thing of like [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2698.6200000000003s)]
*  running out of shells and shit like that. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2701.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I haven't been following that part of it as closely, but like, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2702.86s)]
*  you know, Zelensky, I think I'll remember that literally. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2707.1s)]
*  Yeah. He went to Scranton, Pennsylvania, alongside Joe Biden, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2709.6600000000003s)]
*  which is another reason why Trump fucking hates him, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2713.06s)]
*  because he was like, oh, you were doing like election interference. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2716.1400000000003s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. I truly believe to a certain degree. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2720.02s)]
*  I think that the Republican Party, or at least like the Trump contingency, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2723.86s)]
*  thinks that like Ukraine is libtard shit. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2728.1s)]
*  Yes. Like I think they they're just truly like, no, if you like Ukraine, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2731.46s)]
*  you are a liberal, like you're you're a libtard. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2735.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And it sucks because like the reality is [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2740.18s)]
*  like a bunch of people have died there. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2743.9s)]
*  A bunch of probably more are going to die there. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2746.18s)]
*  I do think it's funny. Trump has always says this shit. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2748.18s)]
*  He's like, way more people have died than we we have been reported, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2750.98s)]
*  which I do think is true. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2753.9s)]
*  But he also always is like, when one of those buildings goes down, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2754.94s)]
*  like he doesn't understand people get evacuated from buildings. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2758.02s)]
*  And so he thinks it's full of like people like Trump Tower or whatever. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2760.2599999999998s)]
*  But but yeah, I just it's it's tough. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2765.5s)]
*  I mean, I have I have no idea. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2768.46s)]
*  I think a lot of it really depends on just like what the fuck [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2770.98s)]
*  the negotiations with the Russians turn out to be. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2773.3s)]
*  And God knows what they're talking about in there. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2776.34s)]
*  I mean, can you believe it? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2779.5s)]
*  You know, like I have no fucking clue [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2780.54s)]
*  like what they're offering or what like I mean, they're there. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2784.06s)]
*  If if if the US is doing anything, it's it's going to stab its ally. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2787.82s)]
*  I mean, there's the famous meme of like Osama bin Laden and fucking [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2791.5400000000004s)]
*  Noriega and everybody like reaching out to Zelensky. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2795.34s)]
*  Yeah. Unfortunately, my brother, I, you know, I think it might be. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2797.94s)]
*  This might be the time. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2800.7400000000002s)]
*  I think America's about to stab your ass in the back. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2801.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I don't understand how people at this. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2803.78s)]
*  I mean, I guess like I get why liberals don't get that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2807.46s)]
*  They're conditioned to not believe that, especially with Ukraine. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2811.82s)]
*  They were like, well, Ukraine is on the right side because they're invaded. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2814.98s)]
*  You know, by a larger power. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2818.34s)]
*  So they were like, oh, come on, let us have this one. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2821.02s)]
*  Like for once we're on the right side of history. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2822.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2825.46s)]
*  Like it was a situation like that. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2826.1800000000003s)]
*  But but yeah, I mean, this was this was an inevitability, I think. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2828.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it really was. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2833.5800000000004s)]
*  And they tried to do our boy Netanyahu like that, too. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2835.78s)]
*  You know what they try to do? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2838.5s)]
*  They try to do that color revolution on Netanyahu and he weaseled out of it. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2840.02s)]
*  But but yeah, I. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2844.7400000000002s)]
*  That's why that's why he's the goat. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2846.9s)]
*  But they really do have genuine manpower issues. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2849.58s)]
*  And like I am again, I'm not a scholar or anything. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2852.54s)]
*  I'm not even a pundit or anything. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2856.5s)]
*  I just my view of whoever is going to win a war is like [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2858.3s)]
*  if you're like relatively parity with technology or relative parity with technology, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2862.6600000000003s)]
*  which are not, by the way, because Russia has better air. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2866.5s)]
*  It's the guy. It's the country with the more guys. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2871.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, absolutely. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2873.62s)]
*  I mean, that is that is the major problem. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2875.42s)]
*  And I don't know how you can overcome that. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2877.58s)]
*  And I think I mean, well, I do know how you can overcome that. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2879.78s)]
*  You just make France and Germany and every other country, Poland [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2883.3s)]
*  forcibly send back every Ukrainian able bodied man. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2889.34s)]
*  And and immediately, as soon as they step foot, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2894.62s)]
*  they get handed a rifle and go into training [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2897.6600000000003s)]
*  or at least get, you know, not handed a rifle, but go into training immediately, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2901.2200000000003s)]
*  like forcibly conscripted. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2904.86s)]
*  But even in that process, like you said, they have [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2906.34s)]
*  a significant shortage of artillery, so much so that [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2910.1400000000003s)]
*  America has had to restart manufacturing [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2914.6600000000003s)]
*  or increase manufacturing of artillery shells. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2918.6600000000003s)]
*  And they were before then they were. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2922.2200000000003s)]
*  And still, I think to this day, we're getting it from South Korea, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2924.1000000000004s)]
*  which, of course, Russia was getting it from the Democratic People's Republic, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2927.3s)]
*  which we haven't really mentioned in this conversation. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2931.2200000000003s)]
*  But they're at the table. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2934.3s)]
*  I feel there's a saying amongst Turks like we always say, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2936.02s)]
*  oh, we are at the table or sometimes we'll say we are the table. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2939.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like a very common Turkish trope. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2943.34s)]
*  We love being involved in like international incidents. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2945.46s)]
*  And I feel like, you know, who else is at the table? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2949.86s)]
*  The DPRK, the DPRK is and God bless him for it. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2952.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, I was I was a doubter because I'm like, show me the troops. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2955.94s)]
*  But but they they seemingly exist. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2959.9s)]
*  And must be. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2962.9s)]
*  I don't know if that would really be my first choice of assignment [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2965.46s)]
*  to go from Korea, North Korea to Ukraine. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2967.98s)]
*  So that God, so the world is just kind of soggy. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2971.34s)]
*  But, you know, it's like, send me to send me to Morocco or something. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2974.42s)]
*  But but it's just yeah, God knows. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2979.06s)]
*  I think what Ukraine should do is invade Poland and then just [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2983.5800000000004s)]
*  you have way more people if you take it over. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2986.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. That's interesting. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2989.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's never that's never been tried before. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2992.38s)]
*  What they need to do is is trigger Article five and get US boots on the ground there. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=2996.1s)]
*  I mean, if this this could end in NATO, which is so fucking funny. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3001.98s)]
*  That's the thing I don't understand of NATO. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3007.34s)]
*  Because that's why I was like, that's never going to happen, because like Trump, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3010.62s)]
*  obviously, regardless of how much he like talks about stuff like, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3015.18s)]
*  what did he do for NATO? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3018.94s)]
*  He said he was going to disband NATO, but he wasn't ever going to disband NATO. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3020.38s)]
*  What did he do? He forced European allies to buy more American weapons [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3023.78s)]
*  like a higher percentage of their GDP must be spent on American weapons. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3028.94s)]
*  That's what he did, which initially was Obama era contract. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3032.5s)]
*  Regardless, Trump just enforced it right. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3035.42s)]
*  And because it was so good that Biden seemingly never overturned it. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3038.1s)]
*  Right. So operating didn't think that Donald Trump would single handedly [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3042.62s)]
*  undermine this protection racket. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3048.86s)]
*  Because it's still beneficial for his benefactors. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3053.58s)]
*  But it does seem like he's so fucking petty that he might do that. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3056.94s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's it's it's strange to me. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3060.38s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's just like really, I don't know, Ukraine. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3063.1400000000003s)]
*  You need to join. You need to go join Belt and Road. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3066.38s)]
*  You need to rebuild with China. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3069.38s)]
*  I'm telling you, you were cast out by the Americans. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3071.1800000000003s)]
*  Go to Beijing. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3075.02s)]
*  That's what I've been saying right now. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3076.06s)]
*  Go to Beijing and be like, let's talk because they're very, you know, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3078.54s)]
*  those people, they know how to they know how to do things. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3082.42s)]
*  Dude, that's literally what I've been saying. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3086.1800000000003s)]
*  I've been saying that, like, like Zelensky was talking on Fox News. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3088.06s)]
*  Like he he's got a he dialed up G beforehand before he went on Brett [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3091.86s)]
*  Bayer and it was like, it's OK, do it, do it. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3096.5s)]
*  Yes, do it. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3100.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like fire when the party fire when the. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3101.42s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3103.82s)]
*  I mean, my God. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3105.54s)]
*  They should just you know what? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3107.7s)]
*  I mean, my thing has always been they should just have a third party [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3109.46s)]
*  enter the conflict and just see what happens. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3112.4199999999996s)]
*  Maybe Turkey. I think Turkey should just go. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3115.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what I that's all I was thinking as well. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3117.9399999999996s)]
*  Black Sea. Turkey should invade both Russia and Ukraine. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3120.02s)]
*  Yeah. Get them in there. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3124.02s)]
*  And because we need we need a line to Poland, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3125.3799999999997s)]
*  or an excuse to Finland, because we need a Turkish corridor [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3127.8999999999996s)]
*  to connect the peoples. Yeah, they are. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3131.62s)]
*  They are Turkic. You are right. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3133.3399999999997s)]
*  That's yeah, this is this is the one to run theory [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3135.7s)]
*  that it extends all the way there, all the way there [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3140.7s)]
*  from Xinjiang all the way to Finland. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3144.2599999999998s)]
*  And of course, Crimea obviously does not belong to Russia, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3147.14s)]
*  nor does it belong to Ukraine. It belongs to the Turks. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3151.2599999999998s)]
*  It is supposed to be the protectorate of the you know, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3154.22s)]
*  it is supposed to be the Tatars who are also of Turkic descent. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3157.1s)]
*  So I am fully in agreement with that. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3162.18s)]
*  It's strange that Turkey is supposed to be this like world spanning great power, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3165.3s)]
*  but like it's I feel like the primary mode of transportation [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=3169.02s)]

*  But like the thing is, like and this is what I keep thinking about is [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4229.94s)]
*  there's a jealousy that I have. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4233.26s)]
*  And I've talked about this on our show a bunch of times. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4234.98s)]
*  But like, could you imagine if like Bernie Sanders won? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4236.94s)]
*  And you know, it would just be like it would basically be the same thing [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4239.74s)]
*  as the Biden cap. I hate to say it. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4242.5s)]
*  Like you would not bring like young, insane people to be like, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4244.3s)]
*  you're shut down, you're fired. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4247.74s)]

*  Like I would love that. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4251.78s)]
*  And so I guess like I guess the good thing that like we can learn from this [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4253.62s)]
*  is it's not that we have much [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4256.78s)]
*  place to to to put anything into practice. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4260.0199999999995s)]
*  But like you can just do whatever you want. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4262.86s)]

*  And so like I am fucking jealous at the end of the day that like [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4269.66s)]
*  Elon Musk's stupid little friends get to go through every federal agency [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4273.259999999999s)]

*  and completely restructure society. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4280.86s)]

*  No, dismantling USAID like. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4295.74s)]
*  Yeah. And we couldn't we couldn't actually fire the Marines [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4298.3s)]
*  because then they would rebel against us. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4301.5s)]
*  So we'd have to just immediately start a war. Yeah. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4302.7s)]
*  Well, like get kind of some. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4305.860000000001s)]
*  You just get no, you got to run the officers program. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4309.26s)]
*  But instead of like making them not woke, Mark Milley was already doing this for us. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4312.06s)]
*  He was teaching them Mao Zedong thought. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54Lwgs-u-s4&t=4316.34s)]
