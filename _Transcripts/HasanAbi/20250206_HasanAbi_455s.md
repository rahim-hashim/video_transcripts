# AOC Ridiculed After Mocking Elon Musk | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA)
*  consistently were yelling at the wrong things about yelling at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=0.0s)]
*  the wrong things in defense of ivermectin. People were not [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=4.2s)]
*  saying ivermectin is not, you know, effective in treating [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  certain diseases or certain parasites specifically, okay, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=10.68s)]
*  or that humans can't consume ivermectin. Okay, its most [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=15.06s)]
*  common usage is in horses is a horse dewormer. And that's why [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=19.32s)]
*  many people are purchasing it from places where you get horse [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=23.56s)]
*  dewormer. And we're using the horse quantities. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=27.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=35.68s)]
*  AOC is mocked after calling Elon Musk one of the most [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=37.16s)]
*  unintelligent billionaires I've ever met. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=39.36s)]
*  Mocked by who? The New York Post readership. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=42.24s)]
*  That there is already in a federal agency who is a watchdog [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=45.96s)]
*  on waste in the United States. That is known as the government. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=50.8s)]
*  You realize this liquid is normal, right? You like to make [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  a big song and dance about small things like that. I mean, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=56.48s)]
*  it's at most an unnecessary risk that you're taking on. And, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  and at best, it might have marginal benefits. You're [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=64.8s)]
*  you're just eating dye, dude. I don't know what you're talking [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  about. Like, can I not just say it's stupid to eat dye? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=73.4s)]
*  Industrial blue dye? Like, is that where we're at now? I can't [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=79.12s)]
*  even say it's stupid. I have to sit here and be like, no, that's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=83.72s)]
*  actually brilliant. Like, what is what is going on, man? Yeah, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=87.6s)]
*  no, I think it's stupid to drink dye. Okay. It's especially [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=92.76s)]
*  stupid when you've made an effort to consistently talk [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=97.32s)]
*  about how dangerous shit like this is. Okay. And yes, there [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=103.08s)]
*  are a lot of chemicals and stuff like this that I drink. But you [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=108.16s)]
*  want to know what the difference is in stuff like this that I [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=111.64s)]
*  drank versus industrial blue dye? One has a tremendous amount of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=114.6s)]
*  research, okay, that shows that it is fine to consume. Ironically [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=120.8s)]
*  enough, the blue dye people then also regularly look to the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=127.56s)]
*  research to claim it's actually much more dangerous. Yes, it is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  dangerous if you consume it in unimaginably high quantities. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=135.56s)]
*  Okay. But so was everything that chatters PFP. Yeah. Chatter came [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=140.6s)]
*  in hot being like, Oh, excuse me. You make a mountain out of a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=146.04s)]
*  molehill with stuff like this. I'm not. I'm not. Also, you are [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=149.64s)]
*  not the secretary of health and human services. So it doesn't [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=154.84s)]
*  even matter what you do in regards to this. Like this was [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  something that people didn't understand about Ivermectin [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  where people just consistently were yelling at the wrong things [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=161.68s)]
*  about yelling at the wrong things in defense of Ivermectin. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=165.92s)]
*  People were not saying Ivermectin is not, you know, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=169.48s)]
*  effective in treating certain diseases or certain parasites [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=172.72s)]
*  specifically, okay, or that humans can't consume Ivermectin. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay, its most common usage usage is in horses is a horse [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  dewormer. And that's why many people are purchasing it from [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=185.16s)]
*  places where you get horse dewormer. And we're using the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  horse quantities, the medicine specifically designed for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=192.6s)]
*  horses. Okay. Horses are much larger animals. So there's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=196.52s)]
*  obviously issue there. Anyway, yeah, people were sucking down [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  on horse pace. But even that wasn't the actual issue here. The [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=204.56s)]
*  actual issue was that there was a false sense of security placed [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  upon Ivermectin as Ivermectin is the savior when the actual [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=212.4s)]
*  creators of Ivermectin kept saying that there is no evidence [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  that this actually helps with COVID no evidence whatsoever. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=222.16s)]
*  And those guys have all the opportunity to lie and say it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=228.52s)]
*  has a tremendous benefits for COVID. They would make a lot of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=233.12s)]
*  money off of shilling Ivermectin if it actually prevented or [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=236.76s)]
*  treated COVID. Never forget when Joe Rogan got COVID through the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=241.48s)]
*  kitchen sink at it instead of the vaccine literally turned [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=244.44s)]
*  gray. Yeah. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=246.68s)]
*  Accountability office. So all these people acting like, Oh, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=247.96s)]
*  we're going to set up an agency to identify waste. As though [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=251.84s)]
*  that's never been an idea before. Like, you know, take a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  number. These people and I can tell you, I in my experience, I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=261.56s)]
*  have encountered many billionaires in my career. You [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=268.56s)]
*  all have seen many of those encounters in hearings in other [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=274.48s)]
*  forms of questioning, etc. I can tell you that this Joe Rogan [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=280.76s)]
*  turning gray was a filter CNN use no dog we want what do you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=287.32s)]
*  mean it was from his Instagram I watched his actual Instagram I [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=290.56s)]
*  didn't watch the CNN coverage. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=293.36s)]
*  Dude initially is probably one of the most unintelligent [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  understandable that he looked like shit he had COVID dude, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=298.88s)]
*  what are you talking about? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=301.44s)]
*  Jim billionaires I have ever met or seen are witness [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=302.56s)]
*  mental and blue is literally a medication not a dye on less [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=306.68s)]
*  chemical infused do the math it's not that hard. Why did you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=309.6s)]
*  come in? Oh God, I don't know what's wrong with my computer. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=313.36s)]
*  Look at this. It's just not even loading shit. It's so goddamn [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=316.28000000000003s)]

*  load module. Clear cache. How do you clear the cache? Is it in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=330.88s)]
*  settings? Go to browser history. I don't want to delete my [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=334.72s)]
*  browsing data. I don't want to get logged out of a bunch of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=338.36s)]

*  though he just simply had a problem. Or that I made a big [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  issue about this stuff. Only to then turn around and be like, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=381.24s)]
*  no, it's just medication. At least RFK doesn't steal from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=385.6s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies. Like why? I don't understand. I [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=389.36s)]
*  don't understand how people get to this place in their minds. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=394.36s)]
*  dominate the narrative. At least RFK doesn't steal from [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=397.88s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies. RFK has installed from [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=400.0s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies to fund his campaign on like geriatric [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=401.86s)]
*  Bernie. Yeah, Bernie Sanders stealing from pharmaceutical [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=404.24s)]
*  companies to fund his campaign. Again, another chatter that is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=408.92s)]
*  duped by Ian miles Chong. Bernie Sanders has never received pack [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=414.16s)]
*  money. As a matter of fact, the people that work at [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=419.88s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies like the janitor has donated to his [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=422.84s)]
*  campaign in small dollar donations. The combination of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=427.28s)]
*  those small dollar donations is what you saw on an Ian miles [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=432.56s)]
*  Chong post Ian miles wrong post. And you turned around and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=436.96s)]
*  thought, Oh, we got them boys. Bernie's making money off the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBGLAqQPnA&t=442.67999999999995s)]
