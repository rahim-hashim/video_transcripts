# Trump's Recently Signed Executive Orders Are Nearly Useless | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY)
*  Why did it change your mind? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=0.0s)]
*  Because I got to use it. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1.84s)]
*  And remember, TikTok is largely about kids, young kids. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4.16s)]
*  If China is going to get information about young kids, I don't know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=8.32s)]
*  I think we have bigger problems than that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, when you take a look, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=16.48s)]
*  I used to cover this back in 2016 as well. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=23.04s)]
*  Exclusive Trump administration canceling flights for nearly 1,660 Afghan refugees says US official 2016 is back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=30.0s)]
*  I suppose. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  No, it'll be worse than 2016. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=43.6s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  There is no help coming from liberals. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=48.32s)]
*  There is no Democratic Party. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=51.64s)]
*  Even institutions like the ACLU have been gutted. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  So like any matter of different, like legal counsel, legal support that would at least like try to hold this kind of process up in courts in paperwork, in mountains of paperwork are kind of gone away. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=58.0s)]
*  They've kind of gone away as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=68.6s)]
*  The courts are also slammed with pro Trump judges that were appointed and the Democratic Party. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=70.44s)]
*  And the Democratic Party itself that at the very least was mounting an aesthetic defense on the basis of civility at times was still creating a permission structure to say, no, this is unacceptable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  And the media was also covering everything that the Trump administration was doing with negative terms for that reason. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=94.16s)]
*  So both the media and the Democratic Party that are supposed to be that are supposed to operate with like some semblance of critical analysis and encountering what Trump is doing in Trump's agenda are no longer doing that, which means that large [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=101.88s)]
*  majorities of the public are not going to be aware of what Trump is doing or care about what Trump is doing or worse. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  They will actually defend what Trump is doing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=121.84s)]
*  That's where we're at right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=124.72s)]
*  Let's see what Elle Revis has to say about Trump's supporters [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=125.88s)]
*  be aware of what Trump is doing or care about what Trump is doing or worse. They will actually [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=127.92s)]
*  defend what Trump is doing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=133.16s)]
*  That's where we're at right now. Let's see what L Revis has to say about Trump supporters [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=149.24s)]
*  and we believe the justification for that is this was a big entrapment operation. We're viewing this day as in American history equivalent as the release of the Iranian hostages. We believe it's that momentous what is occurring today. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=182.4s)]
*  We're hopeful. We're happy. Today's our day. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=196.76s)]
*  So just a few minutes ago I was on a bus that a group that J six vets Association chartered to bring Jan six was to a hotel which they called an undisclosed location. Other Jan sixes are going to a rented house they call the Eagles nest here on Capitol Hill. There's a lot of money available to the people. There's a lot of financing to help people get their feet back on the ground and get their lives back together. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=199.8s)]
*  All right, Ellie. Thank you very much. At least on such incredible reporting to be there to actually watch those those moments. I mean, it is pretty incredible. The moment this country is in watching this happen today and it might happen tonight. Out front now is Jackson ref that he turned his father guy ref it into the FBI for participating in the inspection. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  That's the house currently in prison serving a six and a half year sentence for rioting at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. So obviously convicted and serving his sentence as a house and I appreciate your time. So here we are. And Trump is announcing pardons for January 6th. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=245.8s)]
*  Defendants that this could include your father who's serving a six year sentence of six and a half year sentence as we speak. What's your reaction. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=261.64s)]
*  Well, I'm honestly fibergasted that we've gotten to this point. I mean, I'm terrified. I've taken as many precautions as I could recently. I've I've picked up a gun. I've moved and I've I've gotten myself away from what I thought would be a dangerous situation and staying where I thought my dad could find me or other people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=271.08s)]
*  You know, people that are going to feel so validated by these actions by by this pardon is a I'm just so filled with paranoia about what could happen. I've been waiting all day from a call from the DOJ to just figure it out and know what to do next. Because right now I don't. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=293.64s)]
*  Other than just to sit around and, you know, talk about it. I mean, you're scared. I mean, you're right. I mean, you're you're scared about what could happen from from your father specifically or someone else. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=313.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what other people I think. I don't even know what my father's thinking. I mean, I've talked to my father before, but it I had thought it got better. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=337.08s)]
*  And it really hadn't. My dad is still involved with these militias. He still talks with, you know, a martyr status. He he he has no change. He's more galvanized than ever that I've seen. My mom, too. My sisters are waiting outside the jail cell right now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=347.4s)]
*  And, you know, I feel for them and I I know I know who they are and I love them, but I can't feel safe. And I'm sure hundreds of other families, thousands of other people that have been affected by these people and their actions and what could happen when they're released. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=369.48s)]
*  I mean, who knows? I mean, you know, my dad once called me a traitor and, you know, he said he's good shot. So I have that's, you know, all I can think about. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=386.52s)]
*  We throw on bagels on the wall. Thank you for the 20 committee. The subs. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry, Jackson. You mentioned your sisters and I know you're one of three and your sisters are there and you mentioned your mom, too. And your mom and your sisters are fully on board with your father. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=401.96s)]
*  You talk about it really sounds like January 6th broke your family apart. Is there any way that this? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=414.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  Destroy it. Like, seriously, I mean, my father's actions coming from the Trump presidency and what he thought he what he was doing was right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=423.88s)]
*  I just destroyed it. And I made a, you know, a very, very disgusting decision to inform authorities about what he was doing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=433.36s)]
*  And I still feel horrible about it every day. And, you know, my sisters are out there right now and they're they're rooting for him. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, I understand that I come with a point of love towards that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=451.92s)]
*  Like, I want to be there for them, but I can't. It just isn't safe for people like me that are, you know, I've done the same things I have done to do what I thought to do to protect my family. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=456.2s)]
*  And, you know, it's it's hard. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=468.76s)]
*  But you still love your father. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=471.12s)]
*  Of course, I love him. I love him. I just cannot feel safe around him. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=474.08s)]
*  I cannot feel safe around people he knows. I cannot feel safe around the people my mother knows. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=479.4s)]
*  You know, my mom has, you know, used my name to sit in front of a crowded room of these far right Trump supporters. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=483.79999999999995s)]
*  And whenever she brings up my name and what I've done, the crowd will just roar in just anger about like, what the hell did I do? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=490.84s)]
*  And watching being away from all this and just spectating what they're doing is just terrifying. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=498.56s)]
*  And I can't do anything but just spectate. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=506.4s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=510.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, Jackson, I appreciate your talking. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=512.72s)]
*  It matters as good people can hear it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=515.64s)]
*  And I know it comes not without risk and it comes at cost for you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=517.56s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Good luck. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=522.04s)]
*  President Trump is about to enter the Oval Office to sign more executive orders and perhaps more information on those pardons. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=527.4s)]
*  We're going to bring you that live. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=533.32s)]
*  Plus some of the wealthiest and biggest names in corporate America and technology specifically were there front and center at Trump's inauguration, mixed in with his family members. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=534.96s)]
*  So it's so funny the media trying to be like, wow, you know, corporate oligarchs. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  I can't believe it. Like, yeah, you guys love that, man. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? I don't know. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=554.88s)]
*  It's just these criticisms do ring a little hollow if I'm being honest, if I'm being real, coming from the likes of CNN. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, we are. This is a monarchy, dude. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=569.68s)]
*  Like, and those are ordained, God ordained lords defending the God ordained king. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=574.12s)]
*  We heard him talk about a national emergency. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=583.52s)]
*  Let's look at his immigration and border executive actions. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=585.68s)]
*  I want to go to Maria Villarreal. She's in Texas. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=587.96s)]
*  And then we'll talk about some of those. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  She covers obviously the issue of immigration and the southern border for us. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=591.48s)]
*  And Maria, they were expecting this. Authorities in the border states that Donald Trump would act and act quickly. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=594.64s)]
*  And they've now heard it in the inaugural address. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=601.64s)]
*  They now await the signing with the pen a little later this afternoon to put some of these some of these words into action. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=603.56s)]
*  Exactly what that action looks like remains to be seen. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=610.36s)]
*  And as John Karl just pointed out, whether or not we'll see any sort of beginning to mass deportations still remains up in the air, though. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  He's given every indication, President Trump, that he intends to act and quickly here. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=619.76s)]
*  You know, David, I think Mary Bruce probably put it best a little earlier, right? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=626.76s)]
*  She said we heard the inaugural address and then we heard a second address. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=629.8s)]
*  And I think that's when we really got a good sense of what Trump is really focused on, what's important to him, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=634.12s)]
*  where he feels most comfortable. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=639.36s)]
*  We've been talking about this all throughout the election, right? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=640.96s)]
*  For me, though, this gave us a lot more perspective on what we can expect at the border. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=644.08s)]
*  And I think that's what a lot of people, a lot of contacts and sources down here have been waiting for. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  There have been a lot of rumblings for weeks about what could potentially happen. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=654.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously, he talked today about bringing back remain in Mexico. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  We've also heard a lot of conversations around Title 42. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=662.48s)]
*  And when you talk about. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=665.8000000000001s)]
*  OK, that's kind of crazy. You got Kenneth Vogel. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  New York Times, Kenneth Vogel, the ADL, which recently hired Ballard firm, the lobbying shop headed by one of Trump's top fundraisers, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=669.4s)]
*  Brian Ballard to develop practice and policies to counter the rise of anti-Semitism in the US appears to be willing to give Trump's team the benefit of the doubt. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=676.48s)]
*  That's kind of cool that the New York Times is also doing this kind of reporting on the ADL. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a this is not the treatment that you give an institution that operates inside of American boundaries [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=689.52s)]
*  at the behest of the Israeli government. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  One hundred percent, by the way, often some I think the ADL also gets grants from the Knesset, if I'm not mistaken, the ADL might not. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=700.72s)]
*  But it means that it means that the the new. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=708.84s)]
*  Like the way that. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=715.88s)]
*  Like they're willing to they're willing to actually. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=719.32s)]
*  In an effort to, I guess, maybe be anti-Trump, they're willing to attack. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=722.0s)]
*  A institution that an institution that normally works alongside the State Department. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=728.48s)]
*  Interesting. Under normal circumstances, I can't see the New York Times actually being butting heads or even doing this kind of reporting [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=743.76s)]
*  against the ADL. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=751.52s)]
*  Usually, usually they're the ones who actually take ADL research, no matter how silly that research might look like, no matter how bad its methodology is and use it as a factually accurate in their reporting to beef up the fact that anti-Semitism is on the rise. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=754.0s)]
*  This does not, of course, mean that anti-Semitism isn't on the rise. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=772.04s)]
*  It is. But the ADL's reporting on the matter conflates actual anti-Semitic hate crimes with anti-Israel sentiment being expressed. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=774.6s)]
*  That is the reason why the ADL's reporting shows that there is like a seven thousand percent increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes in the United States of America, because they openly change their methodology to add any kind of anti-Israeli anti-Israel [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=783.64s)]
*  sentiment as an anti-Semitic hate crime onto their surveys. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=798.0s)]
*  The previous president of ADL, Abraham Foxman, director Emeritus of ADL, has for the second time now criticized the current leadership of the ADL. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=810.0s)]
*  Breaking Trump has revoked the Biden administration executive piece, executive order, which imposed sanctions on persons undermining peace, security and stability in the West Bank. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=822.12s)]
*  The five settlers of the Biden administration offered a brief sanctions on that I'm pretty sure it took back on anyway. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=830.24s)]
*  Like he actually went back on this. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=842.36s)]
*  They weren't they weren't exactly pushing for. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=845.2s)]
*  They weren't exactly pushing for this regardless. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=852.48s)]
*  And I think that they just. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=855.8000000000001s)]
*  They he he automatically removed that with with the removal of all executive orders in the previous administration, if you remember. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=859.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=871.9200000000001s)]
*  Abraham Foxman says Elon Musk may be the world's richest man, but that does not excuse his thinking is thanking the Trump supporters of the Heil Hitler Nazi salute. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=875.2s)]
*  In addition to supporting Germany's neo-Nazi party in the next elections, it is a very disconcerting image. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=882.2800000000001s)]
*  This is the second time Abraham Foxman has butt heads with the current leadership of the ADL, Jonathan Greenblatt. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=887.08s)]
*  The last time was also over Elon Musk, as a matter of fact. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=893.4000000000001s)]
*  Just, you know. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=898.2s)]
*  Pointing that out. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=899.0s)]
*  He said this last time, Jonathan Greenblatt did PR for Elon Musk as well. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=901.4s)]
*  He was like, what are you doing? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=904.6s)]
*  What an insane thing to do from your position of authority as someone who's supposed to be the leading figure of combating anti-Semitism. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=906.6s)]
*  Before if situations like Lake and Riley's tragic death were taken, were taken differently by the Democratic Party, then maybe you wouldn't be sitting here having this conversation right now. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=914.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, the part messaging, but part I don't think Democrats have ever said no, no, no, that's not dependent on the Democratic Party. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=922.24s)]
*  Democrats have ever said no, no, no, that's not deport violent criminals. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=927.56s)]
*  We've always been for that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=929.9599999999999s)]
*  But we've all we there's that element of the conversation. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=931.56s)]
*  There's people coming to United States seeking asylum. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=935.16s)]
*  That needs to be addressed. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=937.9599999999999s)]
*  But the people who have been here for years, if not decades, like dreamers, like farmers, like other essential workers that make our country tick, that's a whole different population. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=939.3599999999999s)]
*  And they deserve better than the chaos that is coming back to their families and to their communities under these threats by President Trump. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=950.3599999999999s)]
*  Senator Padilla, I very much appreciate your time and thoughts are with you with what you're going through in your state with those fires that are continuing to rage even as we speak. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=956.96s)]

*  A lot of them are going to help rebuild. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=964.96s)]
*  They are right. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  And there's going to be a lot of need for FEMA, which I know is also part of this conversation. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=967.36s)]
*  Thank you very much, Senator Padilla. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=970.76s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=971.96s)]
*  President Trump earlier today did promise to usher in a quote golden age for America quickly, though, portraying a declining country that's failing its citizens, a failure that Trump says he'll reverse. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=973.36s)]
*  Just got here. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=984.9599999999999s)]

*  Why aren't you moving to a different country then? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1002.36s)]
*  But of course that won't happen. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1006.16s)]
*  You won't have the same wealth elsewhere as you do in America. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1007.36s)]
*  European countries like the UK are piss poor and broke. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1009.66s)]
*  What? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1012.86s)]
*  Why are you complaining about America at what an American is saying exercising his God-given First Amendment constitutionally protected First Amendment rights from a piss poor country like the UK? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1015.0600000000001s)]

*  You have the reform party to deal with anyway. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1039.26s)]
*  I'm sure you like that though, because you're a dumbass most likely EDL supporter. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1044.56s)]
*  He's talked about a lot more drilling. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1049.26s)]
*  Real baby drill is the way he put it today. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1051.76s)]
*  It's where he put it today filling the strategic petroleum reserve. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1054.26s)]
*  But there I know you've also said there were parts of his speech that you would have written. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1058.16s)]
*  We blow up in colony lead love. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1061.46s)]

*  Are you taking a piece? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1067.46s)]
*  My and about fulfilling the promises that he's been making on the campaign trail. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1068.76s)]
*  And I agree with him in that respect. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1073.26s)]
*  I wanted to see the same thing in terms of sending a message about a safe southern border. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1075.26s)]
*  I wanted to see a message about the deportations that he said would happen and he has to honor that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1079.26s)]
*  Go. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1084.06s)]

*  Anyway, he's he's signing new executive orders in the action list executive actions about six commutations in there where we're doing further research. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1087.26s)]
*  Nice to see you again. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1097.46s)]

*  Anything you want to explain about this? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1109.66s)]
*  We hope they get him. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1111.56s)]
*  We hope they come out tonight. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1112.66s)]
*  Frankly, he got Enrico Tario out of prison. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1114.26s)]
*  Expecting it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1116.96s)]
*  Approximately 1500 people. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1121.46s)]
*  He says stand back. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1123.16s)]
*  Stand by commutations. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1124.06s)]
*  With our ideas. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1125.76s)]
*  We're looking at different things, but the commutations would be the ones that will take a look and maybe it'll say that way or it'll go to get a full pardon. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1129.0600000000002s)]
*  And the order does require the Bureau of Prisons to act immediately on receipt of the pardons and commutation orders. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1139.16s)]
*  Sir, this is a why we get that down so they can get him going right now. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1149.5600000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1149.96s)]
*  Yep, absolutely. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1150.3600000000001s)]
*  This is a proclamation guaranteeing the state's protection against invasion based on the current crisis at the southern border and invokes various executive powers relating to the ongoing invasion of the southern border. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1151.6599999999999s)]
*  Those are not going to be blocked by the courts. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1173.06s)]
*  I don't think they will. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1175.96s)]
*  I don't think they can be. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1177.06s)]
*  They're very straight up. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1178.86s)]
*  Why don't you take that and go over here? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1180.36s)]

*  I'm not on the side angle. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1182.9599999999998s)]
*  Do you mind just go right over here with your friends? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1185.4599999999998s)]
*  Okay, sir. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1189.06s)]
*  This is an executive order realigning the United States Refugee Admission Program to better align with American principles and American interests. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1189.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1210.36s)]
*  Sir, this next executive order is about protecting America from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1220.06s)]
*  Again, crisis at the border, but it goes beyond that and it implicates other executive powers as well. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1231.36s)]
*  President Trump, if cartels are now going to be seen as foreign terror organizations, would you think about ordering US Special Forces into Mexico to take them out? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1239.86s)]
*  Could happen. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1255.56s)]
*  Stranger things have happened. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1257.36s)]
*  That would be an act of war, by the way. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1261.06s)]
*  That would be military deployment on foreign soil. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1264.76s)]
*  Except Venezuela. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1267.86s)]
*  Well, we're going to see you in Venezuela. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1269.56s)]

*  I don't want to say when, but it's going to happen. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1291.76s)]
*  It has to happen. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1294.76s)]
*  Oh, we're not going to have a country left. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1295.56s)]
*  This is actually an executive order designating the cartels and other organizations to be foreign terrorist organizations. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1297.56s)]
*  That's a big one. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1304.86s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1306.36s)]
*  People have wanted to do this for years. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1308.96s)]
*  So they are now designated as terrorist organizations foreign. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1314.1599999999999s)]
*  And Mexico probably doesn't want that. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1319.06s)]
*  But we have to do what's right. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1323.76s)]
*  They're killing our people. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1327.06s)]
*  They're killing 250, 300,000 American people a year. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1328.6599999999999s)]

*  Very simple. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1383.26s)]

*  Happy to help with the passing of the torch. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1493.76s)]
*  I did. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1497.56s)]
*  I left him one in the desk just like this. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1497.96s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1501.1599999999999s)]
*  Unification of our country. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1506.36s)]
*  You know, I didn't know that he gave a pardon to his family because he did it during my speech. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1509.6599999999999s)]
*  He didn't tell you to send a letter? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1516.96s)]
*  No, he didn't tell me. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1518.06s)]
*  No, no, he didn't. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1519.06s)]
*  They released it during my speech. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1520.46s)]
*  I mean during my speech. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1522.06s)]
*  So all I could do was say, excuse me, I'd like to come back and speak some more. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  So now we were surprised by that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1529.16s)]
*  It's bad precedent, obviously. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1532.66s)]
*  Where are you thinking on tariffs on Mexico given these actions you're signing on the border? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1534.86s)]
*  Well, we're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada because they're allowing [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1539.66s)]
*  vast numbers of people. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1546.66s)]
*  Canada's a very bad abuser also. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1547.96s)]
*  Vast numbers of people to come in and fentanyl to come in. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1550.56s)]
*  When do you think you would enact those? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1554.06s)]
*  I think February 1st. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1555.66s)]
*  Are you planning on leaving those at that? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1557.56s)]
*  I think we'll do it February 1st. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1559.1599999999999s)]
*  25% on both, sir. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1561.6599999999999s)]

*  This is an executive order taking a large number of executive actions to secure our southern border. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1564.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1570.06s)]
*  Sounds reasonable. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1571.86s)]
*  President Trump, we remember four years ago Barack Obama had told you that the top direct of the country was going to be North Korea. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1576.9599999999998s)]
*  Did Joe Biden tell you what he thinks the top direct to the country is? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1583.76s)]
*  No, I think we have a lot of them. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1586.86s)]
*  Right now. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1591.16s)]
*  We really, I think we have a lot of them. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1591.56s)]
*  Obama's in North Korea is a top threat. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1593.46s)]
*  I was very friendly with him. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1595.86s)]
*  He liked me. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1597.16s)]

*  We got along very well. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1598.56s)]
*  And they thought that was a tremendous threat. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1600.86s)]
*  Now he is a nuclear power. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1603.26s)]
*  But we we got along. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1605.86s)]
*  I think you'll be happy to see him coming back. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1607.86s)]

*  Got a lot of shoreline. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1615.86s)]
*  I want to work with countries from South America to coordinate on immigration. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1616.56s)]
*  About who? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1622.56s)]
*  About immigration in general. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1623.56s)]

*  We need people. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1630.56s)]
*  And I'm absolutely fine with it. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1632.06s)]
*  We want to have it. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1635.56s)]
*  We need it because we're going to have a lot of companies coming in to avoid tariffs. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1636.66s)]
*  You know, if you don't want tariffs, what you have to do is build your plant in the U.S. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1640.26s)]
*  So we're going to have a lot of workers coming in. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1645.8600000000001s)]
*  But we have to have legal immigration. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1648.46s)]
*  Which one? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1654.66s)]
*  No. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1658.26s)]

*  Say it again. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1661.06s)]
*  The China tariffs. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1661.56s)]
*  The broad tariffs. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1662.96s)]
*  Well, as you know, I put on large tariffs on China and they've really been forced to leave them. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1664.96s)]
*  And if we didn't leave them, you wouldn't have one steel mill that's open in this country because they were dumping massive amounts of steel. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1670.76s)]
*  We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China because they and they were unable to terminate the tariffs that put on China because it was too much money and the budgets and work and other reasons to. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1676.56s)]
*  No, I mean, we're going to have meetings and calls with President Xi. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1690.56s)]

*  I have a very good phone call. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1699.1599999999999s)]

*  Are you planning to make NATO alive soon? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1703.56s)]
*  NATO has to pay more money. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1705.56s)]
*  NATO has to pay 5%. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1707.86s)]
*  We are. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1710.26s)]
*  We're in the Ukraine war by 200 billion dollars more than NATO. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1712.56s)]
*  It's ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1716.36s)]
*  We have an ocean in between. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1719.86s)]
*  And we're we've spent 200 billion dollars more on Ukraine than NATO has spent. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1722.36s)]
*  And they've got to equalize. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1728.1599999999999s)]
*  Did you talk to Xi about the Ukraine war? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1729.86s)]
*  Yeah, because China and Brazil together has a proposal to bring Russia and Ukraine to talk. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=1734.1599999999999s)]

*  I think it's costing them a lot of money to maintain it to keep it. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2145.46s)]
*  The people of Greenland are not happy with Denmark. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2149.76s)]
*  You know, I think they're happy with us. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2152.16s)]
*  We had representatives. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2155.26s)]
*  My son had representatives went up there two weeks ago and they like us. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2156.26s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2161.36s)]
*  But Greenland is necessary not for us. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2162.26s)]
*  It's necessary for international security. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2164.6600000000003s)]
*  You have Russian boats all over the place. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2168.5600000000004s)]
*  You have China boats all over the place warships. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2170.1600000000003s)]
*  And they can't maintain it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2174.76s)]
*  Who? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2178.6600000000003s)]
*  I'll be meeting with President Putin. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2182.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2185.26s)]
*  I can't speak center. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2185.76s)]
*  First trip for the 90s. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2186.96s)]
*  So first foreign trip. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2190.16s)]
*  Typically has been with UK. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2193.26s)]
*  But we did it. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2196.16s)]
*  I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy 450 billion dollars worth of our product. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2196.96s)]
*  I said I'll do it. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2202.26s)]
*  But you have to buy American product and they agreed to do that. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2204.26s)]
*  They bought 450 billion. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2208.36s)]
*  It was the least reported story I've ever been involved in. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2209.96s)]
*  Now, where do you think to go now? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2213.06s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2214.76s)]
*  If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another 450 or 500, we'll up it for all the inflation. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2216.16s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2223.46s)]
*  Bro, he's gonna give Saudi Arabia nukes. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2226.16s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2228.46s)]
*  He's just like nuclear arms. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2229.56s)]
*  It's very expensive. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2231.66s)]
*  Saudi Arabia needs it. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2233.06s)]
*  Are you gonna give them the nukes? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2234.46s)]
*  Do you have 500 billion? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2235.96s)]
*  They'll get it from Russia. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2238.66s)]
*  But maybe not quite yet, but it'll end up being in the in the accords. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2245.66s)]
*  The Abraham Accords. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2251.7599999999998s)]
*  I think Saudi Arabia will end up being in the Abraham Accords. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2254.06s)]
*  Could be, but yeah, so not in a very long way. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2259.06s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2262.2599999999998s)]
*  It says ticked up. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2263.06s)]
*  My my my. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2264.7599999999998s)]
*  What is that all about? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2265.56s)]
*  First, we have Alaska, sir. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2266.7599999999998s)]
*  This is an executive order relating to unleashing Alaska's potential as an energy reservoir for the entire nation. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2268.36s)]
*  And what about Anwar? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2274.16s)]
*  I believe that would be included in aspects of the order. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2275.96s)]
*  So we're opening up Anwar. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2278.56s)]
*  Well, it depends on the deal. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2292.66s)]
*  I mean, I may not do the deal or I may do the deal. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2293.96s)]
*  TikTok is worthless. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2296.96s)]
*  Worthless. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2300.36s)]
*  If I don't approve it, it has to close. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2301.06s)]
*  I learned that from the people that own it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2303.86s)]
*  If it if I don't do the deal, it's worthless worth nothing. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2306.36s)]
*  If I do the deal, it's worth maybe a trillion dollars a trillion. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2310.96s)]
*  So I do the deal for the I'm talking about doing it for the United States. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2314.86s)]
*  If I do the deal for the United States, then I think we should get half. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2318.6600000000003s)]
*  In other words, wait, I think the US should be entitled to get half of TikTok. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2323.96s)]
*  And congratulations. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2329.5600000000004s)]
*  TikTok has a good partner and that would be worth, you know, could be $500 billion or something. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2330.66s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2338.56s)]
*  The numbers are crazy, but it's worthless. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2339.16s)]
*  If I don't if the president doesn't sign, then it's worthless. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2341.7599999999998s)]
*  If the president does sign, it's worth maybe a trillion dollars. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2346.16s)]
*  So I think like a joint venture, I think we would have a joint venture with the people from TikTok. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2350.46s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2357.46s)]
*  I mean, that's one of many ideas. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2358.26s)]
*  I've had some. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2360.46s)]
*  The CEO's in town. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2360.96s)]
*  Did he say he's open to that idea? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2361.96s)]
*  Who? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2364.26s)]
*  The CEO of TikTok is around. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2364.76s)]
*  Oh, I think he'd probably like it because he's got nothing. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2366.76s)]
*  They really have nothing. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2371.76s)]
*  It's passed in Congress. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2372.76s)]
*  It gives the president the right to make it make a deal or to close it. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2375.1600000000003s)]
*  And we have 90 days to make that decision. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2380.5600000000004s)]
*  But I could see making a deal with the US gets 50% of TikTok. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2383.6600000000003s)]
*  Polices it a little bit or a lot depends on them. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2388.96s)]
*  But remember they make telephones in China. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2394.6600000000003s)]
*  They make all sorts of things in China. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2396.96s)]
*  Nobody ever complains about that here. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2399.36s)]
*  They're complaining about this. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2400.86s)]
*  So many different products made in China and nobody ever complained about the only one they complain about is TikTok. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2404.46s)]
*  And TikTok is largely young people. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2410.26s)]
*  I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn't have originally. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2412.0600000000004s)]
*  But then I went on TikTok and I won young people by 36% Peter. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2415.26s)]
*  He loves that. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2422.26s)]
*  Republicans typically don't do too well. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2423.0600000000004s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2424.76s)]
*  That's the only reason why he wants to defend TikTok. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2425.5600000000004s)]
*  He's like, yeah, TikTok was great for me with the youth vote. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2429.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm keeping it. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2433.5600000000004s)]
*  50% of TikTok for the approval that TikTok can continue in business. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2434.36s)]
*  If Huawei phones somehow were responsible for him winning the election, he would have saved that too. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2439.36s)]
*  And eventually would be paid for doing that half of the value of TikTok. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2444.06s)]
*  Would there be a private sector owner as well? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2448.16s)]
*  Could be. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2450.16s)]
*  Could be a lot. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2450.66s)]
*  Tell you what every rich person has called me about TikTok. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2452.16s)]
*  He wanted to block TikTok. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2456.06s)]
*  Why did it change your mind? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2457.46s)]
*  Because I got to use it. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2459.2599999999998s)]
*  And remember TikTok is largely about kids, young kids. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2461.56s)]
*  If China is going to get information about young kids, I don't know. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  I think to be honest, I think we have bigger problems than that. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2469.36s)]
*  But you know, when you take a look at telephones that are made in China and all the other things that are made in China, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2473.86s)]
*  military equipment made in China, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2479.56s)]
*  TikTok, I think TikTok is not their biggest problem. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2483.1600000000003s)]
*  But there's big value in TikTok if it gets approved. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2488.1600000000003s)]
*  If it doesn't get approved, there's no value. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2490.6600000000003s)]
*  So if we create that value, why aren't we entitled to like half? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2492.26s)]
*  Does Biden ever do news conferences like this? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2499.96s)]
*  How many news conferences? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2503.06s)]
*  He's not president anymore. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2504.36s)]
*  He's dead, bro. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2505.56s)]
*  Who cares about Biden? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2506.56s)]
*  He's still talking about Biden. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2507.86s)]
*  And it would be zero for the next infinity. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2509.16s)]
*  For infinity, it would be zero. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2512.66s)]
*  Mr. President, can you talk to President Musk? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2514.26s)]
*  Is it going to help implement the executive orders? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2516.96s)]
*  I think you mentioned it. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2519.46s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2520.16s)]
*  Yes, it was technically his FBI that did January 6th. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2520.96s)]
*  He was very busy sending rocket ships up to various places. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2524.16s)]
*  But he always considers the FBI before January 6th and after January 6th, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2527.16s)]
*  especially as a hostile entity. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2532.06s)]
*  By the way, it was quote unquote his FBI that did January 6th with his like [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2535.66s)]
*  head that he had appointed to the FBI after firing the previous one. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2539.86s)]
*  So it's like it was fully his FBI. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2544.06s)]
*  I think he's going to get a lot of votes. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2546.06s)]
*  I think he's going to be at 90% or something. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2548.16s)]
*  I mean, I'm here. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2550.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm here. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2550.7599999999998s)]

*  People know him in the Senate. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2551.7599999999998s)]
*  They know he's good. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2553.16s)]
*  He's doing a good job. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2554.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2554.96s)]

*  I don't know what's going to happen with that. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2555.96s)]
*  He's got some very strong ideas. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2558.36s)]
*  Marco, did you sign the tick tock order? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2561.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2566.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes, that was just so. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2566.36s)]
*  Just sign. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2568.5600000000004s)]

*  Are you still committed with Maduro leaving power in Venezuela? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2572.36s)]
*  We're going to find out about that too, because we're going to probably stop [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2574.76s)]
*  buying oil from Venezuela. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2578.26s)]
*  We don't need their oil. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2579.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh fuck. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2582.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2587.86s)]

*  We don't need their oil. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2601.26s)]
*  Another embargo like the first term? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2602.66s)]
*  No, couldn't be, but we don't want to buy. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2604.06s)]
*  We don't have to buy their oil. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2605.56s)]
*  We have plenty of oil for ourselves. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2606.86s)]
*  So President Trump, that'll change Venezuela quite a bit. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2608.36s)]
*  There's a lot of concern about this during the campaign. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2611.26s)]
*  A question that only works today. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2613.96s)]
*  Are you a dictator on day one? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2616.26s)]
*  No, no. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2618.26s)]
*  I can't imagine even being called that. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2621.36s)]
*  No, I believe in the sanctity of the vote. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2623.46s)]
*  The Democrats didn't because they cheated like dogs, but I believe in the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2627.16s)]
*  sanctity and this was too big to rig. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2630.96s)]
*  This last election was just too big. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2632.86s)]
*  An election that he won. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2635.26s)]
*  So it wasn't, there was no cheating. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2636.46s)]
*  And then, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2638.16s)]
*  Talked a bit about Ukraine and Russia, but how long do you think it would take to end that conflict? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2642.66s)]
*  I have to speak to President Putin. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2650.3599999999997s)]
*  We're going to have to find out. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2651.8599999999997s)]
*  He's not, he can't be thrilled. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2652.96s)]
*  He's not doing so well. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2654.16s)]
*  I mean, he's grinding it out, but most people thought that war would have been [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  over in about one week. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2658.8599999999997s)]
*  I told you he was going to do that. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2660.96s)]
*  So he can't be, he can't be thrilled. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2663.56s)]
*  It's not making him look very good. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2665.56s)]
*  Now eventually, you know, I mean, it's a big machine. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2668.46s)]
*  So things will happen, but I think it'd be very well off to end that war. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2670.66s)]
*  Numbers of almost 1 million Russian soldiers have been killed. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2678.8599999999997s)]
*  About 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers are killed. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2682.96s)]
*  Russia's bigger. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2687.56s)]
*  They have more soldiers to lose, but that's no way to run a country. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2688.2599999999998s)]
*  What did your TikTok order do, Mr. President? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2693.7599999999998s)]
*  Just gave me the right to sell it or close it. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2696.7599999999998s)]
*  Essentially with TikTok, I have the right to either sell it or close it. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2699.96s)]
*  And we'll make that determination. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2705.46s)]
*  And we may have to get an approval from China, too. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2707.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure, but I'm sure they'll approve it. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2709.7599999999998s)]
*  And if they don't approve it, it would be somewhat of a hostile act, I think. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2713.86s)]
*  But it's good for China if it gets approved. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2718.46s)]
*  But you're not guaranteeing that TikTok will be around after 90 days from today? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2721.36s)]
*  No, but it could very well be. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2725.56s)]
*  It makes sense for it to be because it's got tremendous value. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2728.46s)]
*  But if we create the value by approving, you know, in other words, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2733.46s)]
*  that approval gives a tremendous value. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2737.1600000000003s)]
*  If that's the case, then we should be entitled to 50% as a country. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2739.56s)]
*  You want to see? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2743.76s)]
*  You haven't heard that one before, right? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2744.36s)]
*  That's called the joint venture. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2745.86s)]
*  And nobody ever thought that way before. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2748.26s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2753.6600000000003s)]
*  I think it's I think you have a lot of people that would be interested in TikTok [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2754.0600000000004s)]
*  with the United States as a partner. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2757.36s)]
*  Oh, what a great feeling. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2764.0600000000004s)]
*  One of the better feelings I've ever had. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2766.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, we're very experienced now. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2774.0600000000004s)]
*  You would say nobody's ever had experience like I have. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2776.86s)]
*  I've dealt with some very good people. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2780.36s)]
*  I've dealt with some very bad people. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2782.6600000000003s)]
*  And I know who the bad ones are and the good ones are. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2784.26s)]
*  You know, don't forget, I was very successful in primarily the real estate business. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2786.26s)]
*  And people used to say, who's worse, a politician or a vicious real estate developer? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2792.1600000000003s)]
*  And I would say, you know, the real estate developer is far worse. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2800.46s)]
*  But after about three months and getting to know scum like Adam Schiff and other people like that, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2804.66s)]
*  I said, no, actually, real estate people are quite nice by comparison. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2810.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I would. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2820.16s)]
*  But he's told me he wants to make a deal. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2821.06s)]
*  I mean, he wants to make a deal. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2824.06s)]
*  Zelensky wants to make a deal. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2824.96s)]
*  I don't know if Putin does. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2828.16s)]
*  He might not. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2829.2599999999998s)]
*  He should make a deal. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2831.56s)]
*  I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2833.2599999999998s)]
*  I think Russia's going to be in big trouble. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2837.8599999999997s)]
*  You take a look at their economy, you take a look at the inflation in Russia. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2841.06s)]
*  So I would I would hope I would get along with him great. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2845.3599999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I would hope he wants to make a deal. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2848.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, sanctions or tariffs. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2856.7599999999998s)]
*  I think the word tariff is much better because it keeps your dollar stronger. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2858.2599999999998s)]
*  I think tariffs are more effective. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2862.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I use sanctions on Iran. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2863.56s)]
*  Iran, Iran was broke when I left office. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2865.16s)]
*  Iran was broke. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2868.66s)]
*  They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2869.56s)]
*  None. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2873.36s)]
*  They were flat broke and October 7th would have never happened. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2874.86s)]
*  And I think you all know that it would have never happened. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2880.2599999999998s)]
*  They had no money. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2882.66s)]
*  Now they're rich, but, you know, they're weakened in a different way. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2884.46s)]
*  I would say that the one attack by Israel really set them back. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2888.06s)]
*  It really set them back. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2896.46s)]
*  The pages, the pages and others. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2897.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, the attack on air defense was a that was a bad attack for Iran. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2900.16s)]
*  It's an executive order relating to reforms to the federal workforce, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2906.86s)]
*  including to the senior executive service. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2910.16s)]
*  We're getting rid of all of the cancer. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2913.86s)]
*  I call it cancer. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2917.06s)]
*  The cancer caused by the Biden administration. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2918.06s)]
*  How confident are you, Mr. President, that you can keep the ceasefire in Gaza [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2922.8599999999997s)]
*  and conclude the three phases of this deal? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2927.46s)]
*  I'm not confident. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2929.66s)]
*  This is not our war. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2930.3599999999997s)]
*  It's their war. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2931.16s)]
*  But I'm not confident. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2931.66s)]
*  But I think they're very weakened on the other side. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2933.66s)]
*  Gaza, I looked at a picture of Gaza. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2938.06s)]
*  Gaza is like a massive demolition site. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2940.2599999999998s)]
*  That place is, it's really got to be rebuilt in a different way. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2943.76s)]
*  My mind. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=2952.0600000000004s)]

*  And they were looking to do a number in the United States. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3428.06s)]
*  And if they do that, they won't be happy about what's going to happen to them. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3430.8599999999997s)]
*  May. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3441.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but we're not ready for that yet. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3441.8599999999997s)]
*  We may we may put it rapid because essentially all countries take advantage of the US. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3443.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't we don't make any good deals in the US. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3452.3599999999997s)]
*  It's amazing in a way that we exist. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3454.46s)]
*  We don't make good deals. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3457.26s)]
*  We don't have any good deals. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3458.56s)]
*  We have a we have a deficit with almost not all there are a couple. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3460.96s)]
*  I won't tell you their names because I don't want them to find out about it because they'll feel stupid. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3464.26s)]
*  But there are a couple of countries that there are a couple of countries that actually don't make money with us. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3469.56s)]
*  But I don't want to let you know because they'll immediately change that. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3478.46s)]
*  But we're going to we're going to do I tell you what we have our country has a chair. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3483.06s)]
*  I really believe that what kind of universal tariff you didn't do well, you put a universal tariff on anybody doing business in the United States [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3487.66s)]
*  because they're coming in and they're stealing our wealth. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3495.86s)]
*  They're stealing our jobs is stealing our companies are hurting our companies. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3498.06s)]
*  So you put a you put a tariff on to keep them from doing that. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3503.26s)]
*  I'm fine with that. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3513.56s)]
*  Well, he was he had a lot of guys and then they found out that he didn't know what the hell he was talking about. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3516.46s)]
*  And I think they deserted him. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3522.56s)]
*  They deserted him. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3525.16s)]
*  The same guys. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3527.06s)]
*  Look, I don't make pretenses smart guys, but there are a lot of smart people around but they did deserve them. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3529.26s)]
*  They were all with him every one of them. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3534.26s)]
*  Now they're all with me. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3535.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3537.06s)]
*  It's not going to get anything from me. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3538.46s)]
*  I don't need money, but I do want the nation to do well and they're smart people and they have you know, they create a lot of jobs. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3539.96s)]
*  And if they don't do it, China is going to do it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3548.66s)]
*  You know what they've done is they've taken industries and they've taken it away. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3550.16s)]
*  They outsmarted China. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3555.66s)]
*  Elon replied to the ADL. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3558.36s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3559.96s)]
*  He said I did see Kyle. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3560.86s)]
*  What are you going to do about it? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3562.06s)]
*  Not all of them protecting women from radical gender ideology. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3563.26s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3566.66s)]
*  Sure I do. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3578.2599999999998s)]
*  But not when you're being ripped off like we are by the World Health. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3579.2599999999998s)]
*  World Health ripped us off. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3583.46s)]
*  Everybody rips off the United States and that's it. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3586.7599999999998s)]

*  This is Mark. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3606.56s)]
*  Oh, we have just been watching the new. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3607.56s)]
*  By the way, Jake Tapper already full glazed mode did the thing that I told you that they would start doing immediately that they did last time Donald Trump became president and said something so insane. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3612.56s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3626.56s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3628.96s)]
*  One second. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3629.96s)]
*  I got to show you apparently. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3630.96s)]
*  Apparently Jake Tapper was like, well, there was a lot of messaging discipline coming from [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3632.46s)]
*  Donald Trump and JD Vance during the during the campaign. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3638.86s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3648.2599999999998s)]
*  Let me see if I can find it. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3649.2599999999998s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3650.2599999999998s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3651.2599999999998s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3654.26s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3655.26s)]
*  He's just Aaron Rupar is just on a posting frenzy over the. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3656.26s)]
*  Oh, here. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3665.76s)]
*  This is this is a here it is. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3667.76s)]
*  Fact before I bring in Daniel, they'll do some fact checking on some of the things he said that were not true about January 6, 2021. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3669.76s)]
*  I think it's important to point out that the Trump Vance campaign in 2024 was a very disciplined campaign. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3678.26s)]
*  Very, very disciplined. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3688.26s)]
*  Like the messaging discipline that they exhibited when they said Haitians are eating cats and dogs over and over again, which we here at CNN understandably fact checked. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3690.26s)]
*  I was overcome by the discipline that they demonstrated when they kept repeating that lie, that insane racist lie. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3701.76s)]
*  And did a decent job of depicting President Trump as somebody who obviously had strong feelings on the border. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3710.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, definitely. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3720.76s)]
*  And not like a psychopathic racist madman. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3722.76s)]
*  Yeah, they really were. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3727.26s)]
*  They stuck to the message, you know, and they communicated their strong feelings. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3729.26s)]
*  Dude, this is something that Fox News wouldn't even say. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3735.26s)]
*  Like, what are we talking? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3739.26s)]
*  At least Fox News is overtly glazed them. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3741.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3743.26s)]
*  They'd be like, yeah, actually, how can you glaze them even harder? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3744.26s)]
*  This is never mind. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3747.26s)]
*  This is something exactly to a tee that Fox News would say. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3749.26s)]
*  Yeah, when Donald Trump talked about how Arnold Palmer was hanging dung or when he deep throated the microphone at one of his rallies or when his opener at the Madison Square Garden, you sound libed up. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3752.76s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3764.76s)]
*  There was no messaging discipline. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3766.76s)]
*  If anything, the media is actively normalizing and doing historical revisionism over a campaign that we saw and experienced. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3768.76s)]
*  Not that long ago. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3778.26s)]
*  This is not me being libed up. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3780.26s)]
*  It was me doing objective media analysis. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3785.26s)]
*  What a crazy thing for Jake Tapper to say. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3788.26s)]
*  You had strong feelings on inflation and a disruptor, but somebody who was within the realm of normalcy, which is not obviously a political or political thing. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3790.26s)]
*  Like there is a difference. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3802.76s)]
*  There's a difference between like I'm not my job is not to lie to you. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3804.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3810.76s)]
*  My job is to tell you the truth. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3811.76s)]
*  And time and time again, I have communicated to you when Donald Trump, even in the interim period, does something and then he's like, oh, I'm not going to lie to you. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3813.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3823.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3825.26s)]
*  And time and time again, I have communicated to you when Donald Trump, even in the interim period, does something that the Democrats haven't done. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3826.26s)]
*  My job is to also offer additional context and analysis. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3834.26s)]
*  Like, for example, Gaza being the key issue that we've talked about extensively over the past 15 months, the genocide that Israel has conducted. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3837.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3846.26s)]
*  Joe Biden refused to deal with Israel, refused to pressure Israel at all, refused to let Israel budge on the ceasefire negotiations and actively lied at the behest of Israel. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3847.76s)]
*  Donald Trump came in and in a matter of two weeks pressured Israel to commit to a ceasefire. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3860.76s)]
*  Now, I said at the time that there is probably additional assurances that Donald Trump gave to Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3866.76s)]
*  That much is becoming clear even right now. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3874.26s)]
*  The fact that Donald Trump also is talking about how he's going to turn Gaza into beachfront property is further assurances that he is not interested in, obviously, understandably, the emancipation of Palestinian people, make no mistake, and instead is giving Israel the opportunity to re-up and re-arm in the process. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3877.26s)]
*  As they ship more weapons, specifically 2000 pound bombs. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3897.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3902.76s)]
*  If I were to do, if I were to lived up, I would be like, see, Donald Trump is significantly worse than Joe Biden on the issue of Palestine. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3907.76s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3914.76s)]
*  That would be a lived up analysis. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3915.76s)]
*  Clear headed analysis on the matter is different than that. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3918.76s)]
*  You have to, you have to understand there's a difference. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3922.76s)]
*  How do you see this potential West Bank annexation deal playing out for Netanyahu and his base in coalition or so opposed to ending the war? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3926.26s)]
*  Personally, I'm skeptical the deal will survive phase one. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3931.26s)]
*  But what's the calculation for BB? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3934.26s)]
*  If it does, would he regain support by annexation slash KSA piece? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3935.26s)]
*  How do you see a part of it? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3939.26s)]
*  I think that Benjamin Netanyahu and you'll probably agree with me on this. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3940.26s)]
*  His number one thing in Israel, aside from being the security guy, is that he has three decades of of experience with America. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3944.26s)]
*  Everyone in Israel understands that America has to be, you know, a, a, the America is the most valuable ally. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3955.76s)]
*  And that if you have a politician that is quote unquote, the whisper of, of the American state, that's pretty valuable. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3963.76s)]
*  So I think Benjamin Netanyahu is close relationship with Donald Trump will be highlighted by the likes of, you know, channel 14 and all these other, all these other pro Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3973.76s)]
*  Outlets. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3985.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3986.26s)]
*  And that will consistently gain him more support, enough support that he does not have to have a delicate allegiance with all these other people. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3987.26s)]
*  And most likely, most likely will cause him to to regain control of the Israeli government. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=3998.26s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4004.26s)]
*  I don't know if this will happen. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4005.26s)]
*  But what I suspect is he will keep beefing up and Donald Trump will also, Donald Trump will also give him the additional American propaganda from the American state that is necessary for his survival, his political survival. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4006.76s)]
*  So that he can do whatever he wants and, and suffer some political penalties for it, but not so much that it like completely disbands his governing coalition and, and potentially kicks him out of power. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4022.26s)]
*  That is how I think he will be able to stay in power and continue and maybe even limit the offensive actions in Gaza and create a period of fake peace so that he can re up and rearm and annex the West Bank, annex the West Bank in its entirety later down the line. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4038.76s)]
*  I agree partly, but at the end of the day, I'm not sure how he remains a power electorally with the war gone. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4067.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4072.26s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4073.26s)]
*  Especially considering that, and you know this better because you are in Israel, but it does feel like at least from over here that even a brief cessation of hostilities is being seen as a major issue in Israel. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4074.26s)]
*  Like in spite of the fact that you are seeing hostages get released and there's like a brief moment of celebration for that. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4089.76s)]
*  It seems like the broad majority of Israeli society, specifically majorities in the Jewish population want the war to continue, want the genocide to continue, want the death and destruction to continue. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4097.76s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4110.26s)]
*  New York Times making superbly spineless choice in the face of overt fascism. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4111.26s)]
*  Elon Musk ignites online speculation over the meaning of a hand gesture. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4113.26s)]
*  Yeah, I read the article. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4115.26s)]
*  They actually put me in the article. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4117.26s)]
*  So, you know, I can't criticize them too much. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4119.26s)]
*  New York Times is officially a friend of the show now. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4121.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4123.26s)]
*  Bang, you're very left already and small. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4124.26s)]
*  Trish would leave after phase one. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4126.26s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4128.26s)]
*  This is a very interesting article. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4129.26s)]
*  I'm not sure if you've read it, but I'm sure you've read it. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4131.26s)]
*  I'm not sure if you've read it. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4133.26s)]
*  I'm not sure if you've read it. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4135.26s)]
*  I'm not sure if you've read it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4137.26s)]
*  It's interesting to see if he'd permanently join with Ghani. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4139.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4141.76s)]
*  It is pretty wild to think that Israel, like Israeli society broadly is supercharged and primed to continue the death and destruction campaign. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4147.76s)]
*  Like that is, like Benjamin Netanyahu's popularity has only increased as he has escalated the violence. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4158.76s)]
*  It increased when he moved the violence over to Lebanon. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4166.26s)]
*  Like they consider that to be a good thing, a positive thing. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4170.26s)]
*  So if he were to dial that back in any capacity, he would suffer political penalties for it. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4176.26s)]
*  And I don't know, I don't think Donald Trump is, is bold enough to just hang Netanyahu out to dry like that. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4186.76s)]
*  I don't think he would ever do that. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4195.76s)]
*  Even though I don't think he likes Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4197.76s)]
*  So either he like has cut a side deal with Miriam Adelson and, and will cut a side deal with Miriam Adelson. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4199.76s)]
*  I don't think they have different intentions for who governs Israel after the fact, because I've read reporting again, this is like palace intrigue shit, but I've read reporting on Miriam Adelson also not being too fond of the Netanyahu's. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4212.26s)]
*  And, and I know for a fact that Donald Trump is not exactly fond of Benjamin Netanyahu either. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4222.26s)]
*  So unless they have, I don't know, unless they have like a separate setup and they'll allow Benjamin Netanyahu to fall. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4230.26s)]
*  What do you think happens to Palestine? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4242.26s)]
*  Do you think the ceasefire is legit? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4246.26s)]
*  I mean, the ceasefire is illegitimate to begin with, but how illegitimate it is, is entirely dependent on what the Israeli government does going forward. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4248.26s)]
*  So it's illegitimate either in the next 42 days or it's illegitimate after 42 days when phase one is supposed to move into phase two in the process. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4256.26s)]
*  There will still be like 90 plus Israeli occupying force prisoners of war that Hamas maintains. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4264.76s)]
*  And therefore there will still be a lot of public pressure to continue trying to get those hostages back. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4272.76s)]
*  And that is supposed to be the bargaining chip to ensure that the ceasefire goes from phase one to phase two. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4278.76s)]
*  But Benjamin Netanyahu keeps yelling at the public saying over and over again that he's not going to abide by that standard. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4287.26s)]
*  He's not going to go into phase two. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4295.26s)]
*  He's made he's given assurances to small Trish in order to maintain his coalition that by phase two in the next 42 days, they are going to continue the bombing campaign. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qncyt7VTfCY&t=4297.26s)]
