# America Bombed Iran | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk)
*  Do we think Iran will retaliate? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=0.0s)]
*  I like under normal circumstances. Yes. If they if they even care to be Iran going forward, they have to but given what they've done in the past, their their retaliation always has been including the tit for tat between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7.0s)]
*  Dude, you were so wrong. What do you mean? US is briefing troops that Iran will likely retaliate. US military is now briefing troops that its strike on Iran will likely result in counter strikes on US base and facilities in the Middle East and likely activate Iran and other foreign organizations abroad, including US including the US conduct strikes against US persons and facilities according to briefing. I have 10. Of course. I mean, they're just that's what they're anticipating. By the way, it might not happen. Remember, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=31.0s)]
*  three o'clock in the morning here in in Tel Aviv, we got word joined again by by Brett McGurk. Brett, just in terms of concern about US forces in the region, other potential targets from Iran or their proxies. What kind of precautions do you think the US has already begun to take? Or would the US have begun to take in order to to prepare in order to protect their forces? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=56.0s)]
*  I think Anderson, we have been for the last eight days moving personnel, hardening positions, making sure air defenses in. So that has been ongoing. We've been seeing it, particularly movement from some of those facilities in the Gulf States moving into Saudi Arabia, a little more inland. So that has been ongoing. We have in Iraq and Syria. Probably it goes up and down a little bit, probably about 1200 troops or so. And I think that's been ongoing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=84.0s)]
*  At positions that can be vulnerable. I have to say, though, I want to remind everybody and the viewers after October 7th, those positions all came under attack almost every single day by Iranian backed militias. And three Americans were killed at a facility in Jordan. So these militias have attacked us. And it stopped. We got to cease fire because we the number of things that deter further, further attacks. But the point we know how to deal with that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=114.0s)]
*  It's a risk, but it's not a new risk. I think the challenge of Iran's missile program to some of our facilities in the Gulf is real. But the Israelis have been going after those missiles in a systematic way. I would not discount or understate the risk at all. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=144.0s)]
*  Work in Israel, bro. Go live in Israel. Why are you here? Why are all of these people here? You can live there. Israel loves white guys. They love them so much. They let every Russian, every Russian on the planet become Israelis. Okay. Why don't these guys just go live there? Why do they live here? Why do these guys live here and act like they are living in Tel Aviv? Why do they care about the interests of Israel? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=161.92s)]
*  More than they care about the interests of America. Get the f**k out of my country, dude. What the f**k is going on? What do you mean? What is this? Oh, dude, this is a really important thing that we're doing here. Like, dude, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, American foreign policy and Israel's involvement in American foreign policy is one direction. Okay. They are aligned. This much is true. But the reality that Israel [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=191.92s)]
*  gets to call the shots in any capacity is so insane to me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=221.88s)]
*  Now, that's very good. So preparations have been underway. But I look, this is extremely serious. I'm sure intelligence community is doing everything to see what Iran might have in mind. And whether Iran given their disarray can really muster any sort of an effective response. And the hope I know in the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=225.96s)]
*  administration here is that the diplomacy and making clear to Iran that, you know, don't think about it. This can be it prevails. That would not be unprecedented. I have to say something, Anderson. You know, this this event we're seeing right now, totally unprecedented. The last October, Israel launched an air attack into Iran after they were attacked by ballistic missiles. That had never been done before. An overt air attack. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=247.88s)]
*  Israel attacked Iran. The assumption was Iran would massively respond. And they didn't. A couple other things, Anderson, to keep in mind, you know, all presidents are, they're, they're experienced determinist decision making. President Trump did the strike against Qasem Soleimani in January of 2020. And the response was not insignificant. About 15 ballistic missiles were fired at an American base. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=276.88s)]
*  I told you, I told you they would use Qasem Soleimani. Did I not tell you that every single person, Brett McGurk obviously is not in Trump's ear because he was Biden's guy, but they are uniparty, so it doesn't matter. I told you that they would use Qasem Soleimani's retaliation from Iran as a reason to quiet Trump down. If he were to be like, oh, what if war breaks out? Then they probably told us some stupid ass that remember when nothing happened after Qasem Soleimani's assassination? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=304.88s)]
*  Don't worry. These Iranians are servile. They won't do anything. So now that's the best possible outcome here. The best possible outcome here for global stability, I guess, is if Iran doesn't retaliate, if Iran doesn't retaliate, and then, and then they're just like a failed state from this point on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=334.88s)]
*  Fall on the United States attack on Iran. The Home Front Command is changing the guidelines back to the most stringent. Breaking. Com Province Crisis Management spokesperson hours ago after Com's air defense activated and identified hostile targets, part of the Fordow nuclear site was subjected to enemy aerial aggression. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=353.88s)]
*  These are the only, these are a few pieces that we know of what might have happened in Fordow. They still are showing the Fordow strike target. Oh my God. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=367.88s)]
*  They're literally, they love this. They love this satellite imagery, dude. They nut to it. They jerk off. They jerked off to it for literally the past week and a half. Look at that. Look, look, it's just so strikeable. It's so it's just looking. Look at what it's wearing. Look at what Fordow was wearing. It just looks so so submissive and so ready for a strike. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=375.88s)]
*  Effectively eliminated many of the people who would be involved in any kind of response of proxy forces, correct? Yes. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=398.88s)]
*  As a military tactical campaign this military Israeli campaign over the last nine days has been incredibly effective. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=408.88s)]
*  That's tactical. Does it lead to the strategic effect you want of Iran no longer having their enrichment program by which they might be able to produce a weapon still remains to be seen. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=416.88s)]
*  I think the odds of that after the American strikes tonight are very high. But you know Israel's campaign the last nine days also completely unprecedented. I think if you asked anyone who follows them years ago, what would Iran do if Israel launched a massive military intelligence campaign inside Iran? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=427.88s)]
*  I don't know how much stock you can put into what's being said right now, but they largely seem unfazed because by because they insist their nuclear assets were moving out of facilities that were attacked. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=445.88s)]
*  I know they said that already. I know they said that a couple days ago. They said that they had already before even the new agreement started that they would move the enriched uranium that they already had to different places to secret locations. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=454.88s)]
*  So I don't think they have it there. I don't think they're bluffing. No, no, no, that part is not a bluff. I don't think that part is a bluff, but it still doesn't matter. This is a violation of the fucking country sovereignty, man. What are we talking about? This is America entering the war directly. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=470.88s)]
*  I suspect that the reason why they're talking about how unfazed they are is because this might this might show that their response will be relatively restrained again. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=483.88s)]
*  Again, slowly but surely death by a thousand cuts getting destroyed. It's over. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=492.88s)]
*  Later could say I have to drink from the poison chalice and give up the program here. That choice has been made for him and how he responds. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=497.88s)]
*  Oh my God. US President Donald Trump tells me in a phone call. We had a great success tonight. Your Israel is much safer now. Oh my God. Donald Trump literally calling Barack ravine directly. Your Israel is much safer tonight. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=507.88s)]
*  Yeah, Trump post after Suleymani strike on January 3rd, 2020. There it is. Trump post an American flag. Why doesn't Donald Trump go live there, dude? Oh, that's right. Because they don't have enough, you know, gay activities that he likes like Broadway shows and enough interest in churning out good art. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=523.88s)]
*  Is that why you don't want to listen to psy trans every day Donald Trump go live in Israel. Why the fuck are you the president of America? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=539.88s)]
*  The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran rarely tweets in English yet its recent English Post center on condemning the International Atomic Energy Agency signaling that Tehran may be gearing up to pull out of its safeguards agreement with the IAEA. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=546.88s)]
*  Our facilities have been attacked. Why has the International Atomic Energy Agency remained silent? If these attacks are not condemned, the consequences of our decisions will directly fall upon the International Atomic Energy Agency. We no longer trust the IAEA or its inspection regime. They shouldn't. They shouldn't. They're not wrong. That's not a wrong statement. New reporting from CNN Trump hopes strike hope strikes prompt new diplomacy and isn't currently planning on additional. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=560.88s)]
*  Do we are a delusional country? We are actually a delusional country. Iran confirms via drop site spokesperson. Here's the first confirmation from Iranian officials on the strikes. Sposed person for comb provincial crisis management headquarters a few hours ago. The comb air defenses were activated and hostile targets were identified. Part of the Ford outside area was attacked by enemy air strikes. Do we think Iran will retaliate? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I like under normal circumstances, the IAEA is not going to be able to do anything. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=587.88s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=617.88s)]

*  Yemen to also strike American assets in the region on the other side while getting Hezbollah to strike into Israel would be the option. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=674.44s)]
*  I don't think that they're going to do that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=683.8800000000001s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=686.44s)]
*  But if they were to even entertain a fraction of what I'm talking about, gas is going to be a million dollars. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=687.5200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  US briefing troops to expect counter strikes in the region. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=699.0s)]
*  But if the counter strikes in the region are limited, like after the Qasem Soleimani assassination from Trump, then it's not that significant. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  WWE has an event in Riyadh next Saturday would blowing up John Cena be seen as a big enough strike on America? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=707.36s)]
*  I don't know what this will look like. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=714.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=716.2s)]
*  If Iran doesn't retaliate, there was basically telling the world that they're totally chill with what's going on and are basically conceding they don't have sovereignty anymore as dire. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=716.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=723.12s)]
*  It's basically saying we don't have any air to air defenses. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=723.76s)]
*  We don't have any control over our own airspace. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=726.96s)]
*  We have no control over. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=729.12s)]
*  We have no protection. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=730.48s)]
*  You can come in and you can do as hard as you want. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=731.92s)]

*  If Iran doesn't retaliate in this circumstance, or even if it retaliates, there still might be a decapitation strike. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=742.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=748.08s)]
*  If that is imminent, then at that point, it's like, do you want to maintain some semblance of a state, which then you go into long and extended conflict with the United States of America, which is almost surely going to end the American Empire if there was like boots on the ground military warfare.

*  they pack it up and then they push the can of destabilization down the line, maybe like [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1843.9199999999998s)]
*  a couple of months. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1851.28s)]
*  But if. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1855.2s)]
*  But if there's like severe escalation, I don't know who knows where that goes. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1856.96s)]
*  Yeah, look at that March 26, 2003, this war will destabilize the entire Middle East region [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1862.12s)]
*  and set up a global shockwave of anti-Americanism. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1872.8799999999999s)]
*  Add also anti-Semitism to that, too, for the record. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1875.8799999999999s)]
*  This time, at least we've added we've added a new ally to the to the anti-sentiment. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1879.04s)]
*  Because it won't just stay at anti-Americanism. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1886.56s)]
*  There's going to be going to be a lot of going to be a ton of anti-Semitism as well. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1888.76s)]
*  Versus no one won't. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1896.28s)]
*  And part of that is because they weren't even airtight. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1897.28s)]
*  They didn't even justify they didn't even find like a cautious belly. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1900.2s)]
*  They just straight up were like, no, we're doing this for Israel after spending the last [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1904.0s)]
*  year and a half being like Israel is the Jewish nation state. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1908.92s)]
*  And if they don't, if they if you say that they shouldn't kill children, you're an anti-Semite, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1913.4s)]
*  you're a Jew hater, we should throw you in jail. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1919.1200000000001s)]
*  What the fuck are Americans going to think after all of this? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1921.44s)]
*  The Islamophobia is going to explode as well, of course. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1924.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm just reporting on what I suspect will happen with anti-Semitism because like, you [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1927.16s)]
*  know, the the institutional the institutional control over over that form of bigotry will [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1932.4s)]
*  probably be woefully inept at dealing with the with the sea of with the wave of anti-Semitism [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1941.1599999999999s)]
*  exploding in the country. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1948.6799999999998s)]
*  So, yeah. You know, welcome, welcome to welcome to where we've been. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1950.28s)]
*  We all want smaller ones, largely because for the smaller ones, the stakes are existential. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1957.32s)]
*  If this were a one and done exercise, three successful sites strikes against four to [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  Obama's. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1969.2800000000002s)]
*  No, it's fun, by the way. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1970.2s)]
*  People aren't paying attention to the fact that they're chatters. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1971.96s)]
*  Iran does not have a capability of hitting US. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1974.3200000000002s)]
*  They don't have any ballistic missiles that can reach the United States. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1977.2s)]
*  Why do you think we're such a violent belligerent nation? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1981.16s)]
*  It is because we are sheltered by proximity. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1984.1200000000001s)]
*  OK, at most they could do like, I don't know, like a terror attack. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1986.92s)]
*  But I feel like they're a little bit busy right now to implement a successful terror [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1991.0s)]
*  attack on US soil. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1995.2800000000002s)]
*  They're a little they got their hands full. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1996.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=1998.52s)]
*  There are also 40,000 American troops right at the ass cheeks of Iran right now in perfect [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2000.3200000000002s)]
*  striking distance. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2007.04s)]
*  So I think there's plenty of Americans that they could kill in the immediate vicinity [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2008.16s)]
*  if they have even the capability to do so, which or even if they have the interest in [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2013.8s)]
*  doing so. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2020.3600000000001s)]
*  Well said mud slime at Hassan Abiy is mud slime like a Islamophobic take. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2022.08s)]
*  Is that is that what the is like a new thing I haven't heard before? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2029.36s)]
*  Is that a different way of saying Muslim? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2035.12s)]
*  Is that a slur? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2040.32s)]
*  Damn, I've I'd never heard that one before. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2042.32s)]
*  And I hear I hear I hear crazy shit all the time. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2048.3199999999997s)]
*  That's my that's a new one for me. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2055.7999999999997s)]
*  New slur unlocked, new old slur. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2059.04s)]
*  He's picking up the phone for everybody. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2066.12s)]
*  Jonathan Karl, ABC News Chief Washington correspondent. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2067.44s)]
*  I call President Trump about 10 minutes ago. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2071.4s)]
*  He didn't talk details or next steps, but he wanted to say this tremendous success [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2072.88s)]
*  tonight. Careful, you're going to be banned for showing slurs. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2076.12s)]
*  I think this person is probably going to be banned, not me. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2079.48s)]
*  Oh, I knew the gray bar was coming. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2096.52s)]
*  I. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2100.72s)]
*  OK. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2104.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, this was the leader of the Senate Democrats. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2107.12s)]
*  He got his wishes, though, if Taco Trump is already folding on Iran, the American [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2111.88s)]
*  people need to know about it. No side deals. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2115.96s)]
*  That's what remember when Chuck Schumer. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2122.0s)]
*  A few weeks ago came out with this blistering criticism. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2125.48s)]
*  Do you think there will be a Chinese response to this? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2130.92s)]
*  I think if there was any sort of Chinese intervention, this would not have happened. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2133.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what that's what I think. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2137.2400000000002s)]
*  Have we really accomplished? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2140.4s)]
*  You've bought time, probably a lot of time, but the story is far from all of them. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2141.96s)]
*  I want to go to Jim Schudo, who's been looking to measures to protect U.S. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2148.7200000000003s)]
*  forces in the region, Jim. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2152.96s)]
*  Anderson, I'm told that the U.S. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2156.6800000000003s)]
*  forces in the region quite understandably were advised to take shelter until [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2158.6400000000003s)]
*  it was clear that there was no immediate Iranian response. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2164.36s)]
*  They will then remain on high alert for some time, because, of course, that [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2168.52s)]
*  response could come at any time, even if it's not in the minutes or hours [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2172.44s)]
*  right after the attack. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2176.28s)]
*  That's an understandable step to take and one that would have happened in [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2178.1200000000003s)]
*  advance of these attacks. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2182.28s)]
*  And when we have seen attacks in the past, for instance, the killing of [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2183.8799999999997s)]
*  Soleimani in Trump's first term, there were Iranian responses, specifically [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2188.68s)]
*  targeting U.S. forces in the region. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2192.4399999999996s)]
*  The other side of this, by the way, were impacted. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2193.9599999999996s)]
*  True to Parsis analysis is correct. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2198.04s)]
*  He's from Quincy Institute. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2199.8799999999997s)]
*  Trump just guaranteed that Iran will be a nuclear weapons state in the next five to [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2201.8799999999997s)]
*  10 years, particularly if the regime changes. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2205.48s)]
*  Definitely, definitely. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2207.9599999999996s)]
*  The real fear is if Iran retaliates in kind, OK, and launches a brutal [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2210.44s)]
*  counterattack, I don't even know if they have the capacity to do so, to be fair. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2216.84s)]
*  But let's say they did. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2220.6s)]
*  Let's say they did. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2222.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2223.88s)]
*  And in the process, America engages in a decapitation strike. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2225.08s)]
*  America engages in a decapitation strike alongside Israel. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2228.52s)]
*  They killed the Iranian leadership. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2231.96s)]
*  What comes next is going to be a very, very, very, very, very, very, very [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2234.6s)]
*  going to be a torrent of violence, like Iraqi Shias revolting Hezbollah with [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2240.2s)]
*  whatever capabilities they have, launching as many attacks as possible. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2249.0s)]
*  The reason why I say this is because power vacuums is what creates [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2254.52s)]
*  militancy like ISIS. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2260.6s)]
*  OK, this is what happened in this is what happened in Iraq. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2262.7599999999998s)]
*  This is what happened in Libya. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2267.56s)]
*  Open open air slave markets. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2268.92s)]
*  What people fail to comprehend is that the Iranian Ayatollah, the Islamic [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2271.56s)]
*  Republic, is the only diplomatic outcome here. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2280.12s)]
*  They are the ones who were demonstrating restraint. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2285.16s)]
*  They were the ones who were willing to do diplomacy. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2288.6s)]
*  They were the ones who were willing to play ball with the West to a detriment, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2291.32s)]
*  mind you. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2296.04s)]
*  And this attack shows that you need to understand they are a centralized force. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2296.84s)]
*  When Trump says we know where you are, we can kill you at a moment's notice. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2303.2400000000002s)]
*  The thing that stops America and Israel from killing Ayatollah Khamenei is not [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2306.84s)]
*  because they're afraid or something. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2315.1600000000003s)]
*  They're afraid of the retaliation or because they simply can't find him. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2317.4s)]
*  His bunker is too powerful or whatever. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2321.0s)]
*  No, they could. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2323.08s)]
*  They could kill him at a moment's notice if they wanted to. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2323.6400000000003s)]
*  Trump is right when he says that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2325.96s)]
*  The reason why they don't do that is because they're calculating what the best [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2327.56s)]
*  possible day after is for Iran. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2330.92s)]
*  So even at a certain point, the American leadership also understands that if they [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2334.2s)]
*  were to kill the most restrained version of Iranian leadership, what comes after is [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2341.08s)]
*  going to be significantly more invested in punishing every other regional operative. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2349.32s)]
*  No more restraint. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2355.3199999999997s)]
*  Sure, it actually cripples the logistics for all of the Axis of Resistance states in the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2357.08s)]
*  region, but they're already getting some help from China, like Yemen is getting help [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2362.3599999999997s)]
*  from China. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2366.8399999999997s)]
*  You have to understand they're no longer going to hold back at all and they will be [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2367.64s)]
*  uncontrollable. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2373.08s)]
*  Forceful. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2385.72s)]
*  The bunker bombs never used before, so we have never seen this before. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2387.7999999999997s)]
*  No one has. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2392.2799999999997s)]
*  No one's seen it. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2393.08s)]
*  So we don't have a sense yet of what the fallout will be nor what the strategic [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2394.52s)]
*  success will be. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2399.4799999999996s)]
*  Here, let's hear what Donald Trump had to say. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2401.0s)]
*  What was perhaps one of the most powerful statements he made on the campaign trail [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2402.9199999999996s)]
*  that was definitely different from the rest of the Republicans the first time he ran? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2408.9199999999996s)]
*  The war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2413.24s)]
*  All right? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2416.7599999999998s)]
*  Now, you can take it anywhere you want. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2417.56s)]
*  And it took Jeb Bush, if you remember, at the beginning of his announcement when he [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2419.24s)]
*  announced the president, it took him five days. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2424.2799999999997s)]
*  He went back. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2426.6s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2427.3199999999997s)]
*  It wasn't a mistake. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2428.2799999999997s)]
*  It took him five days before his people told him what to say. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2429.3199999999997s)]
*  And he ultimately said it was a mistake. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2433.08s)]
*  The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2435.8799999999997s)]
*  We don't even have it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2439.64s)]
*  Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2440.84s)]
*  Obviously, it was a mistake. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2445.1600000000003s)]
*  George Bush made a mistake. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2447.2400000000002s)]
*  We can make mistakes. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2449.0s)]
*  But that one was a beauty. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2450.2000000000003s)]
*  We should have never been in Iraq. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2451.56s)]
*  We have destabilized the Middle East. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2453.56s)]
*  But so you so I mean, so you still think he should be impeached? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2455.6400000000003s)]
*  I think it's my turn. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2458.84s)]
*  And you do whatever you want. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2459.56s)]
*  You call it whatever you want. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2460.92s)]
*  I want to tell you, they lied. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2462.2000000000003s)]
*  They said there were weapons of mass destruction. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2464.04s)]
*  There were none. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2466.44s)]
*  And they knew there were none. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2467.32s)]
*  There were no. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2468.76s)]
*  He didn't change for the record. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2469.64s)]
*  He did not like, you know, people are like, oh, he was way more fiery. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2471.4s)]
*  No, he's just lying back then, too. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2475.3199999999997s)]
*  Guys, what are you talking about? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2477.72s)]
*  He was president for four years after this, and he continued destabilizing the region. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2479.24s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2485.0s)]
*  Why do you think I kept saying Donald Trump is not a peaceful dove? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2486.2s)]
*  I cannot believe the Democrats are literally conceding territory to Donald Trump. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2489.48s)]
*  Last election cycle to rerun the peaceful dove narrative once again, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2493.8799999999997s)]
*  because Joe Biden is doing a unlimited genocide campaign for Israel. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2498.6s)]
*  He is going to be just as bad, if not worse, than the Harris administration [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2502.12s)]
*  and the Biden administration that was currently doing the unlimited child holocaust in Gaza. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2507.24s)]
*  It's not like we didn't know. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2513.96s)]
*  The problem is the Democrats are so also invested in unlimited war. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2515.56s)]
*  They're such annoying war hawks that Trump was able to lie again a second time around. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2522.36s)]
*  And present himself once again as a peaceful dove. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2529.56s)]
*  Oh, weapons of mass. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2534.12s)]
*  Okay. All right. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2536.52s)]
*  Yes, I'm going to be covering Trump's speech in 26 minutes or whenever he goes live. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2537.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2543.3199999999997s)]
*  Iran is saying that the impacts are overblown signals that they might not be as violent in [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2544.52s)]
*  retaliation. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2550.6s)]
*  Vortex Network, Mediostat 9, Detective Flash over the Ford hour enrichment plant, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2552.6s)]
*  the event registered at 3.90 micrometers and was visible on nighttime microphysics scans. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2556.76s)]
*  The location aligns with the sat with the salt plain east of Fordell. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2562.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2566.44s)]
*  That sounds so crazy. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2567.1600000000003s)]
*  That looks that looks like a little baby. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2568.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2570.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what it's supposed to look like while this communication lasts. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2572.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm wondering, are you seeing anything? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2576.36s)]
*  Are you hearing anything new on the ground there in Tehran? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2577.7200000000003s)]
*  Hi there, Anderson. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2581.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm outside right now here in Tehran. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2582.2000000000003s)]
*  The skies here are actually pretty quiet. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2585.72s)]
*  But as we've been saying before, there was a lot of air defense activity going over going [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2587.3999999999996s)]
*  on here in Tehran over the course of the night. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2591.8799999999997s)]
*  And there are, of course, now several Iranian regional officials who are now confirming that [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2595.08s)]
*  strikes seem to have taken place on the area of at least two of these nuclear facilities [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2599.8799999999997s)]
*  that we've been talking about, specifically in the Qom region. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2605.16s)]
*  The Qom region is south of Tehran. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2607.9599999999996s)]
*  It's where the Fordo nuclear site is located. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2610.2799999999997s)]
*  And a regional official there was saying that a few hours ago, obviously, that was in the [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2613.48s)]
*  middle of the night here in Iran. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2617.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's true. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2618.28s)]
*  The explosion is it penetrates first and then the explosion is delayed. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2619.72s)]
*  I forgot the the GB57. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2624.44s)]
*  So the impact is like hard to but I still assume that it like if it blows up in the [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2628.28s)]
*  nuclear facility there be, you know, we would probably see something more, right? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2633.16s)]
*  It's air forces. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2638.36s)]
*  So that's what a regional official there is saying. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2639.72s)]
*  But when they talk about air defenses being activated, some of them are sort of short [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2642.2s)]
*  range air defenses. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2647.16s)]
*  You know, one of the things that we've been seeing here, especially over Tehran as the [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2648.2799999999997s)]
*  night's been going on, but also in the past couple of nights, a lot of those were anti-aircraft [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2652.04s)]
*  guns that were being activated. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2656.68s)]
*  I've seen less anti-aircraft missiles being fired into the air, even though Iran certainly [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2659.0s)]
*  still does have that capability. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2663.4s)]
*  And also region, the Isfahan region is in central Iran. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2666.12s)]
*  And that's actual where the Isfahan nuclear facility is located, but also where the Netan [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2669.64s)]
*  nuclear facility is located as well. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2674.44s)]
*  And there also a regional official is saying that they witnessed what they call intrusions [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2676.7599999999998s)]
*  near those nuclear facilities, obviously meaning intrusions into the airspace there, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2682.2799999999997s)]
*  that then air defenses were also activated to confront hostile targets, as they put it, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2687.72s)]
*  but that several explosions were heard in that facility, in those facilities as well. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2692.7599999999998s)]
*  So the Iranians now having local officials confirming that explosions took place at those [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2697.8s)]
*  nuclear facilities here in Iran, but again, still trying to come to terms with what is [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2704.1200000000003s)]
*  going on there. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2710.04s)]
*  Still very little information coming out, but certainly it does seem as though regional [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2711.1600000000003s)]
*  officials... [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2715.32s)]
*  It looks like we lost that communication. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2720.36s)]
*  We had a video actually from Fred Pleitgen before, earlier this evening, that we were [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2722.7599999999998s)]
*  going to show. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2729.08s)]
*  I don't know if we have it ready right now, but let's get that, because it does show what [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2730.2799999999997s)]
*  he's talking about. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2733.24s)]
*  It's a video I believe he shot or his crew shot from Tehran earlier in the evening. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2733.96s)]
*  I'm not sure, I think it was around in the 9 o'clock or 9.30 time frame PM in Tehran. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2739.4s)]
*  And you hear, you see some bursts in the air. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2745.56s)]
*  You also just hear anti-aircraft fire, but it gives you a sense of sort of, it's just [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2747.8s)]
*  anti-aircraft fire. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2752.1200000000003s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it's a lot of interceptors, the type of which we see here in Tel Aviv [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2753.4s)]
*  and other cities in Israel, giving a sense of the level of air defenses that they still [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2759.2400000000002s)]
*  have left. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2764.92s)]
*  What the f*** did Hakeem Jeffery say? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2765.5600000000004s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2767.0800000000004s)]
*  Before I look at it, I'm assuming, hold on. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2767.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm not even looking, okay? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2770.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to predict that he's going to say that this was illegal. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2772.2s)]
*  This was illegal only because it was conducted unilaterally by the administration without [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2779.24s)]
*  getting congressional approval. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2784.6s)]
*  And he might even heavily imply once again that he would have been on board with the [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2786.92s)]
*  attacks because Iran must not have a nuclear weapon and Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2793.48s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2797.4s)]
*  Let's see if I'm correct. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2798.36s)]
*  Donald Trump promised to bring peace to the Middle East. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2800.28s)]
*  He has failed to deliver on that promise. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2802.52s)]
*  The risk of war has now dramatically increased. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2804.28s)]
*  The risk of war? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2806.28s)]
*  It's war, man. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2809.4s)]
*  What do you mean the risk of war? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2810.52s)]
*  We're in war. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2811.96s)]
*  You what? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2813.64s)]
*  Okay, good start. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2817.2400000000002s)]
*  And I pray for the safety of our troops in the region who are put in harm's way. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2819.48s)]
*  President Trump misled its war. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2822.6800000000003s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2824.76s)]
*  Our troops are put in harm's way. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2825.48s)]
*  It's... [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2827.48s)]
*  Donald Trump did an act of war against a sovereign state. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2829.08s)]
*  That's like this is giving... [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2837.48s)]
*  This brave Israeli hostage was kidnapped from a tank. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2841.16s)]
*  Like they're soldiers in a military base that is now becoming an active zone of conflict. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2847.4s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2858.36s)]
*  President Trump misled the country about his intentions, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2860.68s)]
*  failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2862.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2865.56s)]
*  Again, risks, American entanglement, and potentially disastrous war in the Middle East. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2866.36s)]
*  First, the Trump administration bears the heavy burden of explaining to the American people why [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2870.2s)]
*  this military action was undertaken. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2873.2400000000002s)]
*  Second, Congress must be fully and immediately briefed in a classified setting. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2874.84s)]
*  Third, Donald Trump's shoulders complete and total responsible for any adverse consequences [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2878.44s)]
*  that flow from his unilateral military action. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2881.8s)]
*  Holy... [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2884.84s)]
*  Yeah, but he's no longer Taco Trump. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2885.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2888.12s)]
*  I don't... [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2890.28s)]
*  I want him to be Taco Trump on this. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2890.68s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2892.68s)]
*  What is this? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2893.72s)]
*  A US CH-47 Chinook helicopter was spotted flying over [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2894.44s)]
*  and out of here to reportedly conduct evacuations. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2897.88s)]
*  I think a lot of people... [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2900.76s)]
*  And their immediate fear in this is like, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2902.76s)]
*  oh, we're going to war. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2905.0s)]
*  Like we're going to be unsafe. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2905.96s)]
*  Like Iran is going to nuke us or something. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2907.8s)]
*  Iran does not have the actual targeting capabilities. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2910.12s)]
*  Okay? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2914.52s)]
*  Iran does not have like the ballistic missiles [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2914.84s)]
*  that they could launch at the United States of America. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2917.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2922.04s)]
*  What you should be upset about and what you should be fearful about [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2923.56s)]
*  and what you should be gearing up for [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2927.48s)]
*  is that in spite our incredible proximity to all of the chaos that we create over there, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2929.96s)]
*  the impact will be met with economic instability here. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2937.88s)]
*  Okay? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2942.52s)]
*  The impact will be met when your family members that are in the military [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2943.6400000000003s)]
*  because they wanted to get a comms degree for free [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2947.7200000000003s)]
*  because we don't have free healthcare [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2950.6000000000004s)]
*  and we don't have free college education in this goddamn country [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2952.28s)]
*  are now possibly going to get their shit blown up. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2955.8s)]
*  That is how you're going to feel the impact. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2959.4s)]
*  Just as we did after 9-11. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2961.48s)]
*  Just as America experienced the impact for years. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2964.6000000000004s)]
*  Okay? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2967.6400000000003s)]
*  If you don't care about all of the potential Iranian civilian casualties in this process [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2968.28s)]
*  because we just chose to destabilize a massive regional superpower, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2975.2400000000002s)]
*  a massive regional power that has been around for a very long time. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2979.5600000000004s)]
*  Mehdi Mohammadi, a senior advisor to Mohamed Ghalibov, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2983.88s)]
*  the speaker of the Iranian parliament. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2987.96s)]
*  From Iran's perspective, nothing particularly surprising has happened. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2990.52s)]
*  Iran has been expecting an attack on Fordow for several nights. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2993.88s)]
*  The site was evacuated long ago and has not sustained any irreversible damage in the strike. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=2996.28s)]
*  Two things are certain. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3000.1200000000003s)]
*  First, knowledge cannot be bombed. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3001.0800000000004s)]
*  Second, this time the gambler will lose. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3002.76s)]
*  If we invade Iran but get universal healthcare, would that be okay? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3004.84s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3008.6800000000003s)]
*  The very fact that we're even talking about having a military capable of invading Iran, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3010.44s)]
*  which make no mistake would be devastating for America as well as Iran, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3016.2000000000003s)]
*  is the very fact that you will never have healthcare. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3020.84s)]
*  There is an opportunity cost to having endless empire, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3023.48s)]
*  and that opportunity cost is you not getting healthcare. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3027.96s)]
*  What did I just tell you? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3031.0s)]
*  It serves two different purposes. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3032.92s)]
*  One, you don't get to have healthcare. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3035.0s)]
*  It's private. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3038.04s)]
*  You have to pay for it. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3038.6s)]
*  That is great for the GDP. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3039.7200000000003s)]
*  Numbers on board. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3042.28s)]
*  But two, in order to get that healthcare, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3043.88s)]
*  now you have to be a loyal servant of the defense department. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3046.6s)]
*  You have to sell your soul to the Pentagon [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3049.0s)]
*  and hope that you don't get your shit blown up in the process [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3051.56s)]
*  so you can have a little bit of that free healthcare. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3054.6800000000003s)]
*  Something that other countries give to their citizens unconditionally. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3058.04s)]
*  Something that Israel, as a matter of fact, gives its citizens. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3060.92s)]
*  Isn't that nice? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3065.08s)]
*  Don't worry Israel, we'll foot the bill. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3067.16s)]
*  We'll keep shipping billions of dollars of weapons and anti-air defense systems [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3069.7200000000003s)]
*  so that you can be safe as you decide to launch an eight front war [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3075.48s)]
*  while you're doing on genocide. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3082.36s)]
*  And don't worry, you can have your healthcare. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3084.44s)]
*  You're going to have free college. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3086.76s)]
*  You know, W Israel. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3087.8s)]
*  Say the president's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3089.96s)]
*  a great violation of the constitution and congressional war powers. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3093.1600000000003s)]
*  He has impulsively risk launching a war that they may ensnare us for generations. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3095.8s)]
*  It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3099.88s)]
*  At least you said his grounds for impeachment. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3102.44s)]
*  The anti-war position here is supposed to be, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3105.16s)]
*  why are we going to war with Iran at the behest of Israel [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3107.88s)]
*  against the intelligence community's own assessment? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3112.2s)]
*  The American intelligence community, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3116.28s)]
*  which has never met a war it doesn't like, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3118.04s)]
*  literally was saying, there's no reason to do this. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3120.84s)]
*  There was a negotiation process taking place. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3123.48s)]
*  According to sources, the VP, SECDEF and DNI advise against getting involved. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3126.36s)]
*  Why have them? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3131.0s)]
*  If you're not going to listen to them, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3131.8s)]
*  I suspect that that might be, that's just probably speculation. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3133.08s)]
*  Look, this is what I said. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3137.72s)]
*  I said the U.S. attacked Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3138.52s)]
*  while using a denuclearization negotiation as cover for Israel to implement a first strike [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3140.84s)]
*  because Israel lied about Iran having WMDs against our own intelligence community's assessment, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3145.0s)]
*  all while talking about Iran's disinterest in diplomacy. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3150.12s)]
*  And now you are watching every single one of these mega- [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3153.7999999999997s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3160.2s)]
*  Of course he's doing an English. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3161.3999999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3162.8399999999997s)]
*  Nanny, how things Trump after the Iran attacks. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3164.6s)]
*  Of course, dude. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3166.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, here, here's Trump's daddy. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3167.8799999999997s)]
*  Let's hear what daddy has to say. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3169.8799999999997s)]
*  Let's see what the real daddy has to say. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3171.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3173.8799999999997s)]
*  Let's see what the big dog is. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3174.2799999999997s)]
*  Say, of course he's delivering a, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3175.48s)]
*  he's delivering an English response, you know, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3178.6s)]
*  for one man and one man only, really, when you think about it. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3181.72s)]
*  This is not for the Americans listening. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3185.0s)]

*  America has been truly unsurpassed. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3223.0s)]
*  I asked my hog brother. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3226.7599999999998s)]

*  I've heard very conflicting reports on this. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3372.2s)]
*  I don't think that's real. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3375.4s)]
*  First of all, you can't just give a heads up to Congress. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3377.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3380.36s)]
*  You can't be like, Hey, by the way, heads up, we're going to war with Iran. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3380.6s)]
*  That's not how this works. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3383.7999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3385.56s)]
*  And secondly, I don't even know if that's the case because a lot of people have been saying [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3386.92s)]
*  that, no, they did not actually get a heads up at all. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3392.52s)]
*  Initial Iranian reports claim the U S hit Ford out initial Iranian reports claim the U S had [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3396.0400000000004s)]

*  The bunker busters once high, potentially symbolic and symbolic, not strategic. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3405.8s)]
*  Ford out was reportedly evacuated material moved. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3410.2000000000003s)]
*  The real question now, how will Iran respond? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3413.2400000000002s)]
*  Mike Pence. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3416.04s)]
*  Remember, we don't know the exact impact of this. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3417.0s)]
*  We don't know the exact impact of this strike. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3420.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3423.64s)]
*  But if it's like a faint, if it's like a very, very limited strike, just to showcase [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3423.96s)]
*  American targeting capabilities, American air superiority, all the stuff to try to bully [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3429.8s)]
*  the Iranian leadership into, I guess, like taking a, taking whatever deal that they will present, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3434.28s)]
*  which is probably kill yourself with a gun, please. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3442.52s)]
*  And then give the country over to the Shah. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3445.72s)]
*  Every single person in American leadership is running around. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3448.04s)]

*  The president made the right call and didn't what he needed to do. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3474.68s)]
*  Leaders in Congress were aware of the urgency of the situation and the commander in chief [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3477.4s)]
*  evaluated the imminent danger outweighed the time it would take for Congress to act. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3481.24s)]
*  The world's largest state sponsor of terrorism was chance death to America. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=3485.08s)]

*  I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they've done. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4048.28s)]
*  And most importantly, I want to congratulate the great American patriots [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4053.16s)]
*  who flew those magnificent machines tonight. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4056.68s)]
*  And all of the United States military on an operation [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4059.96s)]
*  that the world has not seen in many, many decades. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4063.2400000000002s)]
*  Hopefully, we will no longer need their services in this capacity. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4066.2000000000003s)]
*  I hope that's so. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4070.52s)]
*  I also want to congratulate the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4072.1200000000003s)]
*  General Dan Raisen Kane, spectacular general, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4076.28s)]
*  and all of the brilliant military minds involved in this attack. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4080.04s)]
*  With all of that being said, this cannot continue. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4084.28s)]
*  There will be either peace or there will be tragedy far greater than [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4086.92s)]
*  we have witnessed over the last eight days. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4092.6800000000003s)]
*  Remember, there are many targets left. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4095.48s)]
*  Tonight's was the most difficult of them all by far. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4099.4s)]
*  Did I do good? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4102.4400000000005s)]
*  And perhaps the most lethal. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4103.08s)]
*  But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4105.64s)]
*  those other targets with precision, speed, and skill. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4108.92s)]
*  Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4112.76s)]
*  There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4116.280000000001s)]
*  not even close. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4120.52s)]
*  There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4121.400000000001s)]
*  Tomorrow, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will have a press conference at 8 a.m. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4127.08s)]
*  at the Pentagon. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4132.6s)]
*  And I want to just thank everybody and in particular, God, I want to just say [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4134.04s)]
*  we love you, God, and we love our great military. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4140.92s)]
*  Protect them. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4144.6s)]
*  God bless the Middle East. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4146.12s)]
*  God bless Israel. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4148.28s)]
*  And God bless America. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4149.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4151.4800000000005s)]
*  God bless Israel? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4152.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4152.84s)]
*  First of all, the idea that there's no other military that's capable of doing this [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4153.4800000000005s)]
*  is an abject lie. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4156.52s)]
*  The only difference is we get to do it because we are the dominant power on the planet. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4157.4s)]
*  It's not a matter of capability. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4163.08s)]
*  It's a matter of, one, restraint. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4165.08s)]
*  And it's a matter of, obviously, mutually assured destruction [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4167.0s)]
*  and retaliation that would happen. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4170.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4174.28s)]
*  Like flexing that you could strike Iran is ridiculous. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4174.92s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4179.88s)]
*  Of course you can strike Iran. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4180.68s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4182.28s)]
*  But so can Russia. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4183.32s)]
*  So can China. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4184.5199999999995s)]
*  And they can do that to us as well, as a matter of fact. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4185.8s)]
*  The reason why they don't do that is because, one, China is always trade maxing [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4188.68s)]
*  and nutting at the prospect of more trade opportunities that can unfold potentially. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4193.48s)]
*  And Russia's got their hands too busy with Ukraine. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4199.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4202.36s)]
*  This is the primary takeaway. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4202.759999999999s)]
*  Trump says if peace doesn't come quickly to the U S will go after other Iranian targets. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4204.36s)]
*  Stop this fear mongering crap. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4210.679999999999s)]
*  This was much needed guy living in a trailer park in Terrahot, Indiana, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4213.4s)]
*  fantasizing about how much better the world is because America spent his, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4221.0s)]
*  the healthcare money that you will never get on a mass pain on the other side of the planet. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4226.84s)]
*  You and others like you are exactly the reason why we will never have rebellion in this country. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4236.2s)]
*  We will never have a revolution in this country. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4242.68s)]
*  And you will forever exist in a world of anger and resentment and will never understand why you [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4245.0s)]
*  are over all the time and why your living standards never get better. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4254.5199999999995s)]
*  Biden sent 300 billion to Ukraine and more money to Israel. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4259.48s)]
*  And do you think I like Biden? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4262.12s)]
*  You moron. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4265.0s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4266.679999999999s)]
*  You don't understand anything. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4267.5599999999995s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4269.48s)]
*  It's not partisan. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4270.839999999999s)]
*  American foreign policy is uniparty. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4273.5599999999995s)]
*  These people that you think you're on board with, this team that you think is actually [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4277.24s)]
*  doing right by you is doing the exact same shit that Biden did. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4282.68s)]
*  But you hate when Biden does it, but you love it when Trump does it. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4286.36s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4289.4s)]
*  Neither of these teams give a about you. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4290.68s)]
*  Wake up. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4292.76s)]
*  That's my point. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4293.24s)]
*  Why are you lying and saying all these falsehoods? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4294.36s)]
*  You're so dishonest. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4297.4s)]
*  Endless deaths continue with your rhetoric, my dude. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4298.5199999999995s)]
*  Trump just went and struck three nuclear facilities, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4301.08s)]
*  violating numerous international human rights and protocols set in place, including the [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4305.96s)]
*  nonproliferation, the nuclear proliferation treaty. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4311.96s)]
*  And my assessment of those events are what's causing the deaths of Twitch streamer. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4315.96s)]
*  Do you hear yourself? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4321.8s)]
*  I know when you wrote that with your tongue sticking out of the side of your mouth, you [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4324.52s)]
*  were like, I'm about to get him with this. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4328.04s)]
*  It's a real banger. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4329.56s)]
*  But the only thing you've done is basically exposed how unimaginably stupid [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4330.76s)]
*  you are. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4336.2s)]
*  Okay, my dude, good job. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4337.4800000000005s)]
*  Open the schools. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4339.64s)]
*  Open what schools? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4341.16s)]
*  We're going to open the schools. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4342.52s)]
*  The schools also suck dick because sorry, all the money's going to Israel and all the [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4343.4800000000005s)]
*  money's going so we can bomb Iran. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4347.8s)]
*  And slasher says, as we enter the next major world war that will take tens of thousands [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4349.64s)]
*  of lives, I just want to say that I now feel much safer from anti-Semitism. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4353.64s)]
*  The biggest fear in my life. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4357.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4358.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4359.4800000000005s)]
*  Also remember, literally half the country also is now going, oh, why did he thank Israel? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4359.72s)]
*  Are we doing this shit for the Jews? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4365.72s)]
*  Which is of course, certainly not going to explode anti-Semitism in this country either. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4367.56s)]
*  The great anti-Semitism destroyer, Donald Trump, running around being like Shalom Mahmoud [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4372.76s)]
*  and like arresting people for saying Israel should stop killing children. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4379.8s)]
*  He's making real, making a real safe. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4384.6s)]
*  Anyway, everyone that thinks the world is ending. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4386.76s)]
*  I do not know what what Iran's response is going to be. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4390.280000000001s)]
*  But judging by what Iran has done, restraint to a fault, as I've said thus far, I don't [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4395.24s)]
*  think it'll be as we'll see. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4402.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't think it'll be as, as devastating as you think it might be. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4406.5199999999995s)]
*  You clearly don't know much about politics. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4410.92s)]
*  Law is true. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4413.24s)]
*  I don't, I don't understand how any of this works. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4414.12s)]
*  I think whether because Iran simply does not have the capabilities. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4417.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4422.44s)]
*  A God bless Israel in a POTUS address to the nation. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4423.64s)]
*  And technically their anti-Semitism will be valid based on the fact that Israel supporters [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4429.32s)]
*  claim is inextricably a Jewish state for Jewish people. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4432.28s)]
*  Obviously that is not the case, but that's exactly what Israel wants to be the case. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4434.4400000000005s)]
*  Another example of Israel exacerbating anti-Semitism globally. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4437.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4439.88s)]
*  Wait, CNN is reporting that Trump only told the [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4443.64s)]
*  Republican leadership in Congress before the strike. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4446.76s)]
*  Anderson is the question as to why now? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4449.799999999999s)]
*  Why did president Trump feel the need to do this given the fact that his own director [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4452.839999999999s)]
*  of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testified in March saying that the conclusion [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4456.92s)]
*  of the intelligence community was that Iran had not made the decision to go forward with [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4462.759999999999s)]
*  its nuclear weapons program. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4468.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, the understanding I have is that a lot of Israeli intelligence has contradicted that, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4470.04s)]
*  especially in the last few months, especially at the Fordow and Ifshahan nuclear sites. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4476.12s)]
*  And as it was described to me, the Iranians, even in the midst of negotiating, Anderson, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4483.5599999999995s)]
*  even in the midst of negotiating, the Iranians had their pedal to the metal, as it were, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4489.08s)]
*  in terms of the nuclear enrichment program. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4494.36s)]
*  And so the feeling was inside the White House, they just could not take that risk. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4497.88s)]
*  And that's where we are. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4502.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's certainly a lot of concern on the speed with which and also obviously the more [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4504.28s)]
*  recent comments by the IAEA, though the IAEA certainly is not calling for any kind of military [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4509.5599999999995s)]
*  intervention. They were calling for diplomacy, but they certainly raised concerns about the [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4514.36s)]
*  speed of the nuclear program, the enrichment of the up to 60% [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4518.759999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, shut up. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4524.759999999999s)]
*  America is so deindustrialized, we don't even manufacture our own consent. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4527.4s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4531.24s)]
*  It's true. We had to get Israel to do it for us. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4532.76s)]
*  Iran has nothing left to negotiate for nuclear bombs. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4535.24s)]
*  Now the whole world knows for a fact that Iran can't develop nukes because it has no [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4537.64s)]
*  nuclear facilities. No, it still has nuclear facilities. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4541.08s)]
*  It still has enriched uranium, it still has nuclear facilities, and we don't know the [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4545.4800000000005s)]
*  extent of the damage in Fordow, which is where they could potentially enrich more. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4549.64s)]
*  The difference here, however, the the difference here, yeah, Tulsi Gabbard was not invited. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4555.24s)]
*  I know I that was reported on earlier. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4560.04s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard has not been invited to any of the fucking Situation Room meetings in [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4563.8s)]
*  the last couple of days. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4567.64s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4569.48s)]
*  Oh God, he's wearing the fucking lame ass Ronald McDonald ass fucking hat, dude. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4571.08s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4577.48s)]
*  It's not the point. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4579.64s)]
*  I know, but God damn like we are the fucking lame as goddamn country on the planet, dude. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4581.08s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4587.48s)]
*  You know what hurts about seeing images like this? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4588.52s)]
*  It's not just that he did this. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4591.88s)]
*  Okay, that's really fucking lame on its own. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4593.88s)]
*  You're such a loser. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4597.160000000001s)]
*  I know, I know, I'm I know, I'm going to get to you in a second. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4598.6s)]
*  Hold on that. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4601.64s)]
*  You're actually the point I'm trying to make. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4602.92s)]
*  It's not that he did this and lame ass bullshit. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4606.040000000001s)]
*  It's that there are people that you and I exist in the same space as that. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4609.320000000001s)]
*  Look at that and go hell yeah, he looks so fucking cool. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4616.92s)]
*  That makes me want to perish knowing that I am occupying a space with people that are [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4620.28s)]
*  that fucking stupid that look at this image and go, yeah, that's strong. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4629.96s)]
*  He's so strong. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4635.88s)]
*  The very same people that don't understand that all of these actions are consequential [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4637.4s)]
*  for them. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4642.36s)]
*  All of these actions are actually taking away from the resources that could help them, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4643.400000000001s)]
*  help them have an easier go at life, fix the fucking potholes, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4649.8s)]
*  create a robust healthcare infrastructure, fix the goddamn ISPs. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4655.32s)]
*  So we have better broadband internet, you know, free college so they can be educated [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4660.76s)]
*  a little bit better, maybe not constantly feel fear all the goddamn time. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4666.12s)]
*  They'll never understand it. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4670.76s)]
*  It's so cooked, it's so lost. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4673.4800000000005s)]
*  Today, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries released the following statement. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4675.72s)]
*  Donald Trump promised to bring peace to the Middle East. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4678.52s)]
*  All right, we read this already. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4680.2s)]
*  It was fairly limp dick, but a lot of crimson obviously, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4682.04s)]
*  but what Iran is going to do next and all lies waiting for that. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4685.400000000001s)]
*  We'll check back in with you a little bit. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4690.52s)]
*  Free Zakaria also standing by. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4692.360000000001s)]
*  For it. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4695.64s)]
*  I mean, this is moving. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4696.04s)]
*  Jake Tabach just referred to Iran's weapons program as a target of the US attack. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4698.360000000001s)]
*  Again, there's no nuclear weapons program. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4701.48s)]
*  US intelligence have affirmed this dozens of times since 2007, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4703.719999999999s)]
*  having done so again just a few days ago. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4707.08s)]
*  This is an outright lie, but it doesn't matter. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4709.08s)]
*  But US intelligence assessments had reached a different conclusion. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4711.24s)]
*  Not only was Iran, this is from CNN's own reporting, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4714.599999999999s)]
*  which is also backed by the New York Times' reporting as well. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4718.04s)]
*  US intelligence assessments had reached a different conclusion. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4721.32s)]
*  Not only was Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4725.16s)]
*  it was also up to three years away from being able to produce [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4729.56s)]
*  and deliver one to a target of its choosing. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4732.92s)]
*  And remember, they do not have a delivery mechanism [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4736.360000000001s)]
*  that can reach beyond the point of Eastern Europe. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4740.200000000001s)]
*  So the idea that they were going to bomb Western Europe, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4744.4400000000005s)]
*  like they're going to bomb France, they're going to nuke fucking Paris, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4747.080000000001s)]
*  they were going to nuke New York City. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4749.96s)]
*  All of that is an abject fucking lie. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4753.0s)]
*  They do not have this technology. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4755.240000000001s)]
*  You know who does? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4757.160000000001s)]
*  You know which religious fundamentalist country that is an ethnostate [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4758.52s)]
*  that's currently a bloodthirsty monster in the region [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4761.64s)]
*  with a fat nuclear stockpile of potentially 400 nuclear warheads [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4765.320000000001s)]
*  with a delivery mechanism capable of reaching every major city around the planet? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4769.72s)]
*  That country is Israel. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4774.280000000001s)]
*  It's not Iran, it's Israel. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4775.72s)]
*  We know that they have this delivery mechanism [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4777.64s)]
*  and we know that they have the nukes. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4779.96s)]
*  It's very hush-hush, but I mean, they admit it from time to time. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4781.8s)]
*  America knows that they have it. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4785.56s)]
*  It's not Iran though. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4787.0s)]
*  It's fucking Israel. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4788.52s)]
*  Israel has the nukes and the delivery mechanism to reach the United States of America. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4789.64s)]
*  You're lying? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4794.52s)]
*  I'm lying. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4795.4800000000005s)]
*  Liar. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4796.68s)]
*  Okay, you should google the Samson Doctrine to figure out what that's about. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4797.56s)]
*  But don't worry, if they were to ever nuke New York City, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4802.360000000001s)]
*  they could turn around and find a copy of Mein Kampf or something [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4806.040000000001s)]
*  and then it's valid, you know what I mean? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4809.080000000001s)]
*  These New Yorkers were reading copies of Mein Kampf, annotated. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4811.4800000000005s)]
*  We found it in the ashes as someone from Philadelphia, myself, I, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4817.56s)]
*  did not want to nuke New York City. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4823.88s)]
*  But once Zoran Mamdani became mayor, I had no other choice but to nuke New York. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4827.080000000001s)]
*  And then the American leadership would come out and be like, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4834.04s)]
*  thank you for nuking New York City, Mr. Netanyahu, sir. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4836.04s)]
*  We will give you the key, the Reddit key that we initially gave the Ilamas. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4840.280000000001s)]
*  We're going to give it to you now for nuking. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4844.84s)]
*  It's the keys to the city. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4847.32s)]
*  Eric Adams gave it to Diddy last time. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4849.08s)]
*  New York City was three months away under the leadership of Shia Muslim Zoran Mamdani [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4851.24s)]
*  of developing nukes. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4860.28s)]
*  We had to act fast. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4861.719999999999s)]
*  God bless Israel. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4863.32s)]
*  But many in Congress wanted him to do and said and spoke to that. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4865.24s)]
*  Freed, thanks very much. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4869.16s)]
*  I'm here with Jeremy Diamond, Clarissa Ward. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4870.04s)]
*  It really is now a question of, I guess, what Iran chooses to do, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4872.599999999999s)]
*  what Israel continues to choose to do, and it remains to be seen. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4876.04s)]
*  I just thought it was so striking. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4881.16s)]
*  Freed talked about it as a threat. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4883.4s)]
*  I mean, essentially, President Trump was saying to Iran and to the Iranian regime [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4885.16s)]
*  and to the Ayatollah, if you want to survive, you take this one on the chin [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4889.56s)]
*  and you come back to the negotiating table. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4894.36s)]
*  This is your chance now to survive. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4896.92s)]
*  If you're going to fight, then we're going to have a problem. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4900.36s)]
*  I mean, he said it's peace or tragedy. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4903.48s)]
*  That's the choice that's being given. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4906.04s)]
*  And I think it's worth just for our viewers who are not pouring over the minutiae [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4908.04s)]
*  of geopolitics every second hour of the day to go through the different sort of proxies [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4911.72s)]
*  that Iran has at its disposal. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4918.28s)]
*  The nearest one to here, of course, is Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakened [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4920.5199999999995s)]
*  and degraded, did not get involved when Israel began its operations against Iran. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4925.96s)]
*  Do they now feel pressured to do something, to respond in some kind of way, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4931.56s)]
*  because, by the way, Iran has been very clear that if the US got involved, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4935.88s)]
*  every American citizen and every American soldier in this entire region is crazy. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4939.72s)]
*  It's like, why won't Iran do peace as we are bombing them? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4945.16s)]
*  Yeah, I already read it. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4950.36s)]
*  Like I said, the fact that the Iran Atomic Energy Agency [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4952.68s)]
*  is saying that they're going to pursue legal avenues, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4958.12s)]
*  they are, the Ayatollah is basically a democratic party, okay? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4961.32s)]
*  That's it. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4965.32s)]
*  They're feckless institutionalists holding on to a fantasy that does not exist within the [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4966.599999999999s)]

*  It is not real, okay? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4978.5199999999995s)]
*  It is not real at all. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4980.2s)]

*  But what they don't realize is it's either today or it's, you know, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=4986.599999999999s)]

*  in this country where they're like fantasizing about a diplomatic outcome that does not exist. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5000.36s)]
*  It's clear to me that their initial response to this severe violation of their sovereignty, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5007.16s)]
*  just like their initial tit-for-tat campaign between them and Israel in the process, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5017.64s)]
*  in the process of a nuclear denuclearization agreement that they were having with the [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5024.360000000001s)]

*  some sort of peaceful solution that even when they are bruising the Iranian public bloody, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5038.04s)]
*  even when they are destroying Iran, wiping out Iranian sovereignty, his responses, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5044.04s)]
*  they didn't hurt that bad. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5050.44s)]
*  That's what they said tonight. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5052.12s)]
*  They said, oh, actually, we hit our enriched uranium, which is true. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5053.48s)]
*  They did do that ahead of time. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5058.5199999999995s)]
*  We moved all of our stockpiles elsewhere. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5060.5199999999995s)]

*  No. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5076.2s)]

*  if I was the head of state of a country that is being bruised and battered [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5226.12s)]
*  by a belligerent attack dog for the largest superpower on the planet, okay? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5231.0s)]

*  I would like to launch maximum amounts of Dongfeng missiles [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5258.2s)]
*  is what I would probably do in that situation. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5262.28s)]
*  International law collapsed in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5264.759999999999s)]

*  and Trump has torn the mask off in 2025. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5270.839999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5273.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5274.36s)]
*  Dongfeng missiles in the direction of commercial vessels potentially flying above them, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5275.74s)]
*  you know, mining the straight of hormones, closing it down. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5281.58s)]
*  Dongfeng missiles in the direction of oil refineries, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5284.62s)]
*  but that wouldn't happen because that would also hurt China's interest. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5286.7s)]
*  Also, there's the other side of this as well. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5289.74s)]
*  China loves trade maxing, as I've said before, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5291.98s)]
*  and they would hate for a global disruption of any sort against shipping or God forbid energy. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5294.299999999999s)]
*  That means less trade. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5301.099999999999s)]
*  That means economic collapse and that means no trade. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5303.42s)]
*  And they love trading. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5307.66s)]
*  If they don't trade, they explode. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5308.78s)]
*  So obviously, obviously they, they probably would not be on board with that. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5310.46s)]
*  But it doesn't even need to get to that point. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5316.3s)]
*  If you don't want America to blow up your nuclear facilities, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5318.86s)]
*  put some Chinese military in your country. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5321.66s)]
*  If you don't want America to blow up your nuclear facilities, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5324.38s)]
*  put some Russian military in your country. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5326.14s)]
*  It's kind of that simple. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5328.54s)]
*  There are Russian nuclear, there are Russian civilian nuclear sites in Iran. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5329.98s)]
*  They were not attacked. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5337.0199999999995s)]
*  It would also be weird, of course, for, you know, relatives to kill one another [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5338.219999999999s)]
*  when you got, you know, Israeli, Russian, Air Force pilots [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5342.62s)]
*  throwing missiles in the direction of Russian nuclear scientists down in, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5346.94s)]
*  on Iranian soil. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5350.46s)]
*  That would be really tough, but they didn't do that. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5351.42s)]
*  They didn't do that. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5355.259999999999s)]
*  I think that's a major concern. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5357.66s)]
*  You're talking about, it's not, the problem is that we're talking about [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5359.66s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of kilograms of... [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5363.98s)]
*  Look at this, look at this. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5366.7s)]
*  Oh God, I hate Brock Reveed. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5367.58s)]
*  I talked with President Trump tonight on the phone [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5369.98s)]
*  and he touted the tremendous success of the military operation. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5371.82s)]
*  No other military could have done that, he added. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5374.0599999999995s)]
*  Two days was within two weeks pointing to his comments on making a decision [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5376.3s)]
*  within two weeks for operational security. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5379.26s)]
*  So he just lied. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5380.94s)]

*  and American negotiations are meaningless. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5424.54s)]

*  He wants peace more than anybody. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5557.18s)]

*  Listen, guys, I'm telling you right now, judging by what Iran has said so far, it feels like [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5684.320000000001s)]
*  they're just going to say it feels like they're going to say it feels like they're going to [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5692.400000000001s)]

*  And their retaliation will be fairly limited. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5702.48s)]
*  This doesn't mean that further war is avoided here because the appetite for further death [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5705.44s)]
*  and destruction and regime change is coming from our side. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5711.919999999999s)]

*  Best case, they just say, oh, we ate it. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5729.599999999999s)]
*  It's not that bad. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5732.879999999999s)]
*  It's not that bad. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5734.4s)]

*  But then again, this is a severe violation, a severe violation that could be a wake up call [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5738.5599999999995s)]
*  for the Iranian leadership to say, okay, maybe they just don't have any interest in negotiations. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5748.719999999999s)]

*  Who knows? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5757.6s)]

*  And I've already detailed what that would look like mining the Strait of Hormuz, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5765.6s)]
*  lobbing ballistic missiles in the direction of every American asset in the region, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5770.240000000001s)]

*  If they don't do this, then America is going to do the bombing campaigns again, and again, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=5786.240000000001s)]

*  Okay. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6210.08s)]
*  God forbid China ever take the stage as a global hegemon in the direction of peace [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6210.8s)]
*  and prosperity. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6217.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6218.96s)]
*  No, the only time they would literally, they would hit the nuclear option as long as America [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6220.400000000001s)]

*  this is unacceptable. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6236.4800000000005s)]
*  Nukes are about to fly. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6238.16s)]
*  Nukes are about to fly unless you restore global trade right now. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6239.84s)]
*  We have to trade max. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6242.8s)]
*  Oh, new chapter, new page. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6244.24s)]
*  Let's start again. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6248.4s)]
*  I think realistically, even if this does end up in the long term having a positive [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6249.76s)]
*  impact on some level, this is a new chapter now and we have no idea what it entails. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6254.8s)]
*  And you also have to think about the years and the millions and hundreds of millions [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6261.2s)]
*  of dollars that the Iranian regime spent on this nuclear program. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6266.32s)]
*  How much they have staked on this program, even just from a domestic politics standpoint. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6270.24s)]
*  I mean, this is an incredibly embarrassing moment for the Iranian regime to see these [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6276.88s)]
*  three sites, according to President Trump at least, destroyed in a one fell swoop with [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6282.4s)]
*  these strikes. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6288.5599999999995s)]
*  They are going to need to find a way to save face here. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6289.679999999999s)]
*  And does that entail these significant attacks that we have been anticipating potentially [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6292.48s)]
*  against US troops in the region? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6296.639999999999s)]
*  Does it entail significant attacks against Israel where we are right now? [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6298.24s)]
*  And how do they move forward? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6303.679999999999s)]
*  And so this is an incredibly volatile moment as much as we were talking before about the [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6306.16s)]
*  way in which this is earth shattering and changing the face of the region potentially. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6310.799999999999s)]
*  We don't know which direction things are going to go in. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6315.599999999999s)]
*  And this is a very delicate moment for Israel and also for US troops and civilians in the [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6318.72s)]
*  region as well. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6324.400000000001s)]
*  Kylie Atwood is standing by. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6325.2s)]
*  Kylie, I understand you have new reporting on US diplomats in the region. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6326.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So what we're learning as you guys are talking about the potential Iran retaliation, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6330.64s)]
*  we don't know what that will look like or when it will come. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6335.6s)]
*  But the US embassy in Iraq and the US consulate in Erbil, both of those are undergoing a pretty [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6339.12s)]
*  dramatic drawdown as we speak. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6347.44s)]
*  There are flights that are leaving Iraq earlier this evening. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6349.12s)]
*  They were actually halted for some time because there are questions right now about the air [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6352.639999999999s)]
*  space in this area, as you can imagine, Anderson. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6356.96s)]
*  But as the United States is drawing down, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6360.639999999999s)]
*  Israeli media claiming that Israel will stop the attacks on Iran now. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6363.44s)]
*  Dude, I'm telling you right now, anything Israel says, assume the opposite. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6366.48s)]
*  Okay. You're going to get like a 90% hit rate. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6372.16s)]
*  Maybe, maybe they'll stop. I don't know. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6375.92s)]
*  Maybe this is the 10% where they're being honest. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6377.68s)]
*  Okay. But I swear to God, if you were to listen to everything Israel says and take it seriously, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6379.84s)]
*  like Anderson Cooper, you would be wrong 90% of the time. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6386.16s)]
*  If you were to at the, if you were to unconditionally state that everything Israel says is a lie, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6390.16s)]
*  you would be wrong 10% of the time. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6395.52s)]
*  I think I would rather go with the second option. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6398.16s)]
*  Okay. All they have to do is send birdful positive people directly to the US and we'd [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6400.32s)]
*  be on our knees. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6403.76s)]
*  That's you're not wrong. You're not wrong. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6406.72s)]
*  Oh my God. All they have to do is maybe that's what the, the Iranian government is. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6410.4800000000005s)]
*  Hope is, is that like, they're going to collapse eventually. And by day, I mean, me, us, we, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6418.0s)]
*  so we should just keep doing as much diplomacy. We'll just eat. We'll tank the damage to the [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6425.04s)]
*  best of our ability any day. Now they're going to kill themselves. Anyway, it's probably their [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6429.2s)]
*  position. Everyone is trying to play the waiting game. Nobody wants to be the hegemon right now, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6434.56s)]
*  because inevitably it's going to end. It's going to end. We can't, we can't sustain this. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6439.4400000000005s)]
*  A lot of people have diluted themselves in the thinking we can, but we can't sustain this. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6445.200000000001s)]

*  Egypt overland for understandable reasons. I want to bring in general Wesley Clark from her [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6454.4800000000005s)]
*  NATO Supreme allied commander, general Clark, who your thoughts on this [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6459.120000000001s)]
*  is Sakura. Shut up. This is a further escalation. This is a further escalation than, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6462.719999999999s)]
*  then the Trump administration deciding to unilaterally strike Iran without telling anyone [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6471.92s)]
*  else. Send me the clip, send me the link right now. Sorry. This is for all the adults that are [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6477.76s)]
*  watching. This is a totally irrelevant side point. We don't know about Fort or maybe they have. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6482.88s)]
*  We also, as you all were saying, we don't know about where the nuclear materials are. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6489.52s)]
*  The Iranians have said they've already, who might have kissed a girl for the first time ever. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6496.72s)]
*  And so forth. This is big news. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6502.080000000001s)]
*  It is, as Clarissa Ward was saying, a very, very volatile and uncertain time. I just hope that the [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6504.320000000001s)]
*  president will use the momentum and the dominance that he has achieved to really push this regime. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6511.76s)]
*  I hope we're not going into another argument that we had on Friday with the Europeans of, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6520.4800000000005s)]
*  you won't enrich. Yes, we will enrich. No, you won't. Yes, we will. Because this really [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6527.280000000001s)]
*  isn't about enrichment, is it? It's really about a state that has dedicated the last 40 plus years [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6532.320000000001s)]
*  to the destruction of another state in the region. And this is the chance to really push [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6538.8s)]
*  for a redefinition by Iran of their purpose, whether that's a regime change or a US just [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6545.6s)]
*  backing away from what they previously said. But it should go deeper than simply trying to [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6554.64s)]
*  avoid escalation dominance and hope we can restore the situation that we had before. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6562.88s)]
*  It's about trying to move to, as Clarissa said, a new chapter. And that new chapter needs to be [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6569.6s)]
*  that Iran has given. I want everyone to remember that Uncle Cy Hersh was right once again. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6576.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. When the goat speaks, we listen. Do you understand? Nobody, and I mean, nobody got it [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6581.6s)]
*  with pinpoint accuracy, with the exception of the great, the goat, Seymour Hersh. Okay. Remember that. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6591.2s)]
*  I do hope that we have people working underneath this, talking to lower level people inside Iran [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6600.4s)]
*  and getting their sense of things. And maybe there are people inside Iran who say enough of [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6607.2s)]
*  this whole regime, let's change the direction of Iran now, save the civilization that we have. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6612.639999999999s)]
*  But these really prime minister was so sad that on June 13, he promised that it owns nuclear [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6619.5199999999995s)]
*  capabilities would be destroyed. And he has kept that promise speaking to his own citizens. He [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6626.0s)]
*  said that he did this because it on is an existential threat to Israel's existence. And [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6632.639999999999s)]
*  previously, the army chief of staff had said that really loud sounds at Tehran camp, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6637.919999999999s)]
*  Israeli intelligence had told them that there was something it on was doing that was reaching [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6643.6s)]
*  this point of no return. All right, that's Hamza Zulhud joining us live from Amman. Thanks so much. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6650.0s)]
*  Let's bring you up to speed. Here's what we know so far. My cousin has family in Iran check messages, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6657.12s)]
*  bro, you're Mexican. I know because you said I'm Mexican in the past, when you lied to me about [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6661.68s)]
*  your cousin that works at CNN. Okay, don't stop. Stop. What's wrong with you after other targets. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6667.52s)]
*  Trump says the objective of the strikes was to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6675.280000000001s)]
*  to stop any nuclear threat. Yes, I know. Hasan's dump truck. I know, I know my chatters. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6679.76s)]
*  Who has also spoken. He thanked the US for the strikes. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6686.4800000000005s)]
*  Shahram Akbarzadeh is the director of the Middle East Studies Forum, a Deakin University in [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6689.76s)]
*  Australia and a senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs in Doha. He says the [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6693.84s)]
*  strikes on Iran will not lead the regime change in Tehran that the US and Israel are hoping for. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6698.24s)]
*  I guess the most obvious precedent is what the United States did in relation to Iraq. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6703.12s)]
*  The United States organized a coalition of the willing to topple Saddam Hussein under the false [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6708.96s)]
*  pretense that he was developing weapons of mass destruction. It happened that there were no WMDs [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6716.16s)]
*  in Iraq, that it was all a lie. And the United States plunged Iraq into decades of crisis and [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6723.36s)]
*  anarchy. So I think that's the precedent. And I think that tells us why Netanyahu has been pushing [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6733.92s)]
*  Trump to get engaged because they knew they couldn't destroy Iran's nuclear facility. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6743.92s)]
*  Okay. Let's, let's hear from the top Democrat. What did he say two weeks ago? Does anyone have [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6750.16s)]
*  the video? Do you guys remember the video? I want to show the video because it doesn't do it justice [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6756.639999999999s)]
*  passing the bolt and blunt. Yeah, no nuking Iran, like blowing up Iran or blowing up another, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6762.8s)]
*  like Muslim country in the region is the American foreign policy version of just one more lane, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6770.32s)]
*  just one more lane, bro. Please, bro. Things are going to be so different this time, bro. I [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6777.2s)]

*  we got it. Okay. Just one more. And this is the same principle for American foreign policy. One [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6796.08s)]
*  more regime change. I promise things are going to be so good. I promise. I promise things will be [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6802.32s)]
*  different this time. It's going to be so easy. It's going to be fun. You're going to have fun [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6809.36s)]

*  the brave opposition leader of the Trump regime had to say when a couple of weeks ago, Trump was [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6824.799999999999s)]
*  talking about potentially doing a side negotiation with Iran in the denuclearization agreement. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6830.96s)]
*  When it comes to negotiating with the terrorist government of Iran, Trump's all over the lot. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6835.36s)]
*  One day he sounds tough. The next day he's backing off. And now all of a sudden we find out that [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6840.4s)]
*  Witkoff and Rubio are negotiating a secret side deal with Iran. What kind of bull is this? They're [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6846.0s)]
*  going to sound tough in public and then have a side deal that lets Iran get away with everything? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6852.64s)]
*  Get away with what? Everything. Like what? Have sovereignty? What do you mean? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6857.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. Okay, good to know. Director of Iran Project and Senior Advisor at the [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6878.72s)]
*  International Crisis Group. Iran's response is likely not just limited to military retaliation. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6884.56s)]
*  MPT withdrawal is quite likely. I don't think so. What the Iranian atomic agency said, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6888.88s)]
*  what the Iranian atomic agency said is not the same as this. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6896.4800000000005s)]

*  It's so busted. Oh, Ocita had a great take. I saw on the toilet when I was peeing. Donald Trump is [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6907.04s)]
*  an extremely stupid man with very few real policy preferences who has simply done what mainstream [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6914.0s)]
*  conservatives wanted 80 to 90% of the time since he entered politics. They wanted to bomb Iran. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6917.92s)]
*  He bombed Iran pretty straightforward. The main problem with Donald Trump is that he's a Republican, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6923.839999999999s)]
*  except Democrats also want to bomb Iran. Felix is so funny, man. Okay. We're have 83,000 people in [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6929.599999999999s)]

*  If Iran wants to push this into something else, the response will be against Swift and all [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6941.12s)]

*  This is what I don't understand. Americans think, and I'm not going to read Felix's response. Okay. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6957.12s)]
*  I'm not going to read it because I don't want to get banned because he is on a tear right now on a [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6962.96s)]

*  before you say that he is being anti-Semitic for whatever he's saying on there, I didn't even look [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6973.92s)]
*  at the screen. Okay. I didn't even see it. If he said something crazy, I didn't even see, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6979.44s)]
*  I didn't endorse it. Okay. Now, when Americans say, the Houthis gonna learn why we don't have [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6984.8s)]
*  healthcare, I lose my mind because dude, you are the one who doesn't have healthcare. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=6992.56s)]
*  And you basically have realized that the reason why you don't have it is because we're bombing [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7000.320000000001s)]

*  And that's why we don't have healthcare is so stupid. It doesn't make any sense. You should [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7020.32s)]
*  be mad at America, not celebrating the fact that you don't have healthcare and therefore [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7024.96s)]
*  we're going to bomb Yemen. It really, it really doesn't make sense. Hype Train, shout it out. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7030.719999999999s)]

*  Yeah. No, that was the masterful gambit from Saudi Arabia. They did 9 11 and then we just mysteriously [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7067.28s)]
*  attacked every other country in the region. Okay. Like, and we were like, you're our greatest ally, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7075.76s)]
*  sir. Thank you for defending Israel. Our other greatest ally. What an incredible event for [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7082.72s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. We might give them nukes by the way. That's the other thing. You just slap America in [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7088.72s)]
*  the face of they say, please, sir, I want some more. Meanwhile, these dumps are running around [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7094.24s)]
*  being like, they're disrespecting us. They're, they're disrespecting us. These other countries, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7097.76s)]
*  they're disrespecting us. It's like, bro, what is Israel doing? What is Saudi Arabia doing? [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7103.28s)]
*  Okay. You're doing tricks on it. Your politicians that think care about you are doing tricks on it. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7107.84s)]
*  And the reason why they're doing tricks on it, it being Saudi penis and Israeli penis is because [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7114.639999999999s)]
*  the military industrial complex machine is demanding that your politicians do tricks on it. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7121.599999999999s)]
*  God forbid you get a moment of respite from all of this. Okay. God forbid. I know I can't believe [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7127.28s)]
*  I criticized Saudi Arabia and said they were responsible for 9 11. That was very anti-Semitic [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7134.0s)]
*  of me. I know. Anyway, here is notable answer. Not included in the 60 minutes broadcast last [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7138.24s)]
*  night was an overtime as which foreign country she considers to be us is greatest adversary. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7143.92s)]
*  Here's what Harris says. Our greatest adversary. I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7148.32s)]
*  Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands. Okay. This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7156.0s)]
*  what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7163.2s)]
*  Why couldn't we girl boss our way to this one, dude? Are you chatters happy? Are you guys happy? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7172.08s)]
*  We could have been doing the exact same thing, but with a black Asian woman in charge instead. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7178.88s)]
*  The outcome would be the same, but think about how woke we would be in the process. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7186.32s)]
*  That is one of my highest priority. So if you have proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7194.48s)]
*  would you take military action? I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7198.8s)]
*  Which all right, someone sent me the girl boss genocide video, the music video. We have to play [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7204.32s)]

*  completely from the process. Why is there no audio? What's happening here? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7217.44s)]
*  It must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7221.5199999999995s)]
*  As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7229.28s)]
*  strengthened our alliances and engaged with our brave troops overseas. As commander in chief, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7237.36s)]
*  I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7246.32s)]
*  And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families. And I will [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ywx2ELWKk&t=7253.84s)]
