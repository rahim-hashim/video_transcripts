*  as we just saw here earlier this week, we saw Senator Pedia go and crash sector, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=251.27999999999997s)]

*  to say what I think because I will get arrested, not just banned, but probably arrested. So I'm [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=270.88s)]
*  not going to say anything, but I'm thinking it. And I'm very upset. That's all I'm going to say. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=278.47999999999996s)]

*  that, we're seeing an epidemic of Democrat politicians who are seeking higher office, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=302.8s)]
*  much like the mayor of Newark who went and crashed Delaney hall and tried to get into [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=306.96s)]
*  secure facility. Then earlier this week, we saw Senator Pedia, a sitting US Senator, go and crash [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=311.2s)]
*  secretary Noam's press conference and aggressively approach her. I mean, this is [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=318.56s)]
*  aggressively approach her. Just the third one in a row. These guys want their 15 minutes of fame [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  and they want to do it off the backs of our ice law enforcement officers. And we won't stand for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=329.36s)]
*  in this administration, our law enforcement officers, their safety comes first. And so does [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=334.08s)]
*  the American citizens as well. You know, same line they use yet. This is her. I didn't know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=337.92s)]

*  Why are you arresting me? And with what authority? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=384.0s)]
*  Number one is going to go with him. All right. Hang on. Where's number one? Hold on. Hold on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=388.88s)]

*  This is how it started. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=518.88s)]
*  You have a judicial warrant. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=520.48s)]

*  been dropped. I'm happy to report I am just fine. I lost a button. Assembly member Zohran [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=576.96s)]
*  Mamdani is surging in the mayor's race. He and Lander have cross endorsed each other's candidacies. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=583.44s)]
*  This is not about an election. This is about ensuring that we protect the city and the country [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=589.2s)]
*  that we love. Now this is a live look at Foley Square which by the way was quiet until [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=593.84s)]
*  Brad Lander was arrested. Now by the way he just showed up here moments ago and as expected to a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=601.6s)]
*  hero's welcome. The front runner in this mayor's race, former governor Andrew Cuomo. He is also [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=607.28s)]

*  of Trump's ice out of control. This is not who we are. It goes on to say this is the direct result [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=618.72s)]
*  of the mayor handing the keys of our great city over to... Andrew Cuomo forgot he's running [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=624.72s)]
*  alongside Trump as opposed to running against him. You know for a moment, for a moment he [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=630.16s)]
*  forgot I think for a brief moment he's like this is not who we are. I would definitely not do the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  exact same thing except I too am also incredibly right wing like Eric Adams and also am compromised [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=642.16s)]
*  in the same exact way that Eric Adams is with a Department of Justice case that is hanging over [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=649.76s)]

*  Andrew Cuomo is so soft on ice and why he hasn't called for Brad's release you can just follow the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=673.12s)]
*  money. Andrew Cuomo's biggest donors raking millions from ice. Reporter regarding Cuomo [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOk0x7b37A&t=676.5600000000001s)]
