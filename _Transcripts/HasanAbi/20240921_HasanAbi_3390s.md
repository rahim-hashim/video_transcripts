*  That's crazy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=20.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=22.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=30.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=33.0s)]
*  No, it's all good. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=35.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=37.0s)]
*  No problem. Have a great day. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=41.0s)]
*  You are so tall. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=43.0s)]
*  I asked a question and it was real. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was real. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=47.0s)]
*  I asked a question and it was real. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=49.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I noticed it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=51.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=53.0s)]
*  Do it. Just run it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=55.0s)]
*  You can stop. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's fine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=59.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not going to be an issue here, I don't think. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=61.0s)]
*  Okay, a lot of people have been waiting. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=63.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=65.0s)]
*  I wanted to catch you early before you were in the crowd. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=67.0s)]
*  I just wanted to say that you're the reason that I'm going into government. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=70.0s)]
*  And I probably wouldn't have been as into politics as I am if it wasn't for you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=74.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. Well, I'm glad you're doing something. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=80.0s)]
*  And you helped me learn so much more about what I wanted to do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=82.0s)]
*  One of my biggest things that's close to my heart is labor law. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=86.0s)]
*  Because of you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=90.0s)]
*  That's amazing. You're in high school. What are you talking about, labor law? That's crazy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=92.0s)]
*  And just last summer I did a study abroad in California, Estonia studying for C&P. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=96.0s)]
*  Because I wanted to go into diplomacy because of the Palestinian crisis. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=101.0s)]
*  And watching the UN and stuff. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=108.0s)]
*  So it was just... I would not be where I am without you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=112.0s)]
*  And I would not be towards college as I am. I would not be looking at the majors as I am. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=117.0s)]
*  So you literally changed that way. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=123.0s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=128.0s)]
*  Like I said, I'm a P-Rand subscriber. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=130.0s)]
*  But not a P-Rand fan. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=134.0s)]
*  And I remember watching you last year at TwitchCon. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=137.0s)]
*  And watching you say that you wanted to meet people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=141.0s)]
*  You were worried that you would miss someone who you changed their life. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=145.0s)]
*  And I was watching that and I was thinking, oh, that's me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=150.0s)]
*  And when I came here I was like, I have to meet you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=153.0s)]
*  I was in front row at the debate awards yesterday. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=157.0s)]
*  I had one of the debate awards cards at my hotel room. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=161.0s)]
*  Oh, you grabbed one of the cards they threw? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=165.0s)]
*  One of the people on the producing team was picking them up and he handed them to me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=168.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=175.0s)]
*  So I go to the front row and I'm like, can I get a picture with you? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=177.0s)]
*  Sure, of course. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=180.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=183.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=185.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=187.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=189.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=191.0s)]
*  Alright, okay. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=193.0s)]
*  Everybody take your phones out. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=195.0s)]
*  We're going to go through it quickly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=197.0s)]
*  Bro, you cannot be walking past like that without saying what's up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=201.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=205.0s)]

*  I'm live streaming right now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=208.0s)]
*  I thought you were going to... [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=212.0s)]
*  Hey, what's up? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=214.0s)]
*  I thought you were coming to the fucking... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=215.0s)]
*  The thing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=217.0s)]

*  Yeah, several times. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1012.14s)]
*  OK, and it doesn't wear out on the color? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1013.14s)]
*  No. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1016.14s)]

*  He's doing a what? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1038.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't want to bug you, but people are like... [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1040.6200000000001s)]
*  What's up? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1042.6200000000001s)]
*  We're here meeting Hamas Abhi, the number one terrorist in America. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1043.6200000000001s)]
*  Dude, stop, don't laugh. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1048.6200000000001s)]
*  He is so dangerous. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1051.6200000000001s)]
*  This is direct to Beirut. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1053.6200000000001s)]
*  Say thumbs up, Beirut. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1056.6200000000001s)]
*  Thumbs up, Beirut. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1058.6200000000001s)]
*  And he's the reason why you're bummed. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1060.6200000000001s)]
*  Bro, this shit's gonna explode if you keep talking like this. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1063.1s)]
*  They don't have connection to this, they're poor. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1066.1s)]
*  Israel, they need our money. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1069.1s)]
*  Okay, what do you want to say to all of Lebanon, Palestine, all the people? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1071.1s)]
*  I don't know what I'm supposed to say. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1078.1s)]
*  Just say it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1080.1s)]
*  Shabak and Tahrir. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1081.1s)]
*  No wonder terrorists is not good. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1082.1s)]
*  It would be America if you were smart. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1085.1s)]
*  Zionism will end inevitably. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1087.1s)]
*  But... [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1089.1s)]
*  But what? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1090.1s)]
*  Not from the river to the sea. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1091.58s)]
*  From half the river, and then you do half the sea, then maybe you make a mix. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1093.58s)]
*  So then you can protect half the people. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1098.58s)]
*  No more apartheid. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1101.58s)]
*  No more apartheid. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1102.58s)]
*  We'll end the apartheid, but we'll bring Starbucks. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1103.58s)]
*  That's only after the apartheid is over. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1107.58s)]
*  But then... [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1109.58s)]
*  Okay, but then McDonald's? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1110.58s)]
*  Only after the apartheid is over. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1113.58s)]
*  Okay, and then Taco Bell. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1114.58s)]
*  Okay, no Taco Bell. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1117.58s)]

*  Alright, nice to meet you. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1130.06s)]
*  Alright, let's do it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1133.06s)]
*  Let's boogie. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1134.06s)]
*  This way? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1135.06s)]
*  Gotta go. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1136.06s)]

*  Can we walk and talk real quick? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1139.06s)]
*  I have to go. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1142.06s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1143.06s)]
*  We're running. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1144.06s)]
*  I need you to thank you. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1145.06s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1146.06s)]
*  Have a good one. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1147.06s)]
*  Just point to us and say it's our fault. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1148.54s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1150.54s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1151.54s)]
*  No, it's fine. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1152.54s)]
*  I'll own it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1153.54s)]
*  You vented the back. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1154.54s)]
*  I'm not like the Faze boys. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1159.54s)]
*  I don't do L-Ego. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1161.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1162.04s)]
*  When fans come up, L-Ego. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1163.04s)]
*  I saw those clips with Ron and Lacey. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1165.62s)]
*  I got W-Hunger and W-Aura and not L-Hunger, L-Hora or L-Ego. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1169.26s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1175.54s)]
*  We lost them completely. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1177.02s)]
*  Chat has no idea what I'm saying, but they're repeating it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1180.22s)]
*  They're saying L-Ego in the chat. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1182.18s)]
*  Yeah, I got W-Hunger, W-Aura. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1184.06s)]
*  You better have W-Hunger too at the top of the hour when there's a three minute ad break. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1186.74s)]
*  It's a big L if you watch the ads instead of subscribing. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1191.28s)]
*  For six dollars or for free with a Twitch Prime. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1195.78s)]
*  Here's a three minute ad break now. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1199.5s)]
*  Are you using Zoomer language? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1205.94s)]
*  You're making it seem like, oh, I'm glad we did the back door here. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1207.7s)]
*  Yeah, this is really scantily. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1211.22s)]
*  I don't think that really solved much. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1213.22s)]
*  As soon as we walked out, someone was like, oh. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1215.22s)]
*  It'll be solved. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1218.22s)]
*  It'll be solved. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1219.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1220.22s)]
*  Ron, hi. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1228.22s)]
*  It's cucked. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1232.22s)]
*  I'm never getting that Miku figurine. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1236.22s)]
*  What? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1241.74s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1242.74s)]
*  The Miku figurine? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1243.74s)]
*  No. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1244.74s)]
*  Wait, there's a Hasu Miku figurine here? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1245.74s)]
*  Probably. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1248.74s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1249.74s)]
*  They just straight up have a... [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1254.74s)]
*  Bro, when you come to the convention, you're walking anyway. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1263.94s)]
*  But the wire people walking on the pelotons. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1266.94s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1268.94s)]
*  All right, we're on our way to the artist's alley right now. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1270.94s)]
*  This is one of my favorite parts of TwitchCon. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1273.94s)]
*  We're going to go check out some of the artist's work here. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1275.94s)]
*  And maybe we can secure the bag. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1278.94s)]
*  We can get something sweet. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1280.94s)]
*  Maybe we get Marge a Hasu Miku figurine that he really wants, apparently. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1282.94s)]
*  Seems... [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1287.94s)]
*  I haven't been here yet. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1288.94s)]
*  You haven't been here yet? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1291.94s)]
*  No. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1292.94s)]
*  When have I gone here? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1293.94s)]
*  I've only been here with you. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1294.94s)]
*  Why, what are you doing when you're not with me? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1303.94s)]
*  Hanging out with my... [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1307.94s)]
*  Partying, that's what. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1308.94s)]
*  Oh. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1309.94s)]
*  Is this the only artist's alley, or is there another floor or something? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1310.94s)]
*  This is the only one. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1315.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1316.94s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1317.94s)]
*  This is about to get unruly, Jack. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1319.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1321.94s)]
*  You're good with that? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1324.94s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't want to get swarmed here. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1325.94s)]
*  So, like, if a bunch of people come up, like, I just want to walk around, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1326.94s)]
*  talk to some of the people here, see what their wares are, maybe buy some things. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1330.94s)]
*  And if I can do that, then that's great. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1335.94s)]
*  I'll hold that. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1339.94s)]
*  The only thing is, like... [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstOuYUJwRA&t=1340.94s)]
