# This Should Have Happened Sooner | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4)
*  Is that we don't really have to do anything. We just have to like optically make moves like this like make PR moves like this and say Trump is bad. We're against Donald Trump but never at a moment when they actually have to do it. And I know people are going to yell at me and say [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=0.0s)]
*  this, huh? You're such a leftist nuisance. Blah, blah, blah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=17.0s)]
*  In any case, here is Cory Booker. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=25.8s)]
*  Deficits in the trillions and trillions of dollars. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Or are we going to do something different like John Lewis would call us to do? He would call us. We're in the final five minutes of Cory Booker breaking the record [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=35.6s)]
*  that previously was held by segregationist Strom Thurmond against the Civil Rights Act. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=45.6s)]
*  John don't hate each other. He is now at a hundred thousand live viewers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=52.4s)]
*  Said this about the presiding elder, different parties, but he showed me an act of kindness during this speech. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=59.0s)]
*  He and I've talked about energy policy has amazing ideas. I want to partner with him. Don't hate anybody. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=66.8s)]
*  Did the folks in Birmingham, Martin Luther King, Fred Shuttlesworth, Dorothea Cotton, James Bevel, did some bigger fire hoses to match James, the sheriff's, Bull Connor. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=72.6s)]
*  Thank you. I've been standing here a long time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  They didn't do that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=96.8s)]
*  They were creative artists of activism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=98.6s)]
*  Libs are going crazy mode over this by the way, they're locked in their dialed in. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=101.5s)]
*  They love this hundred and forty thousand on the Associated Press. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  The one good thing about this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  I will say the one good thing about this is that there is appetite for a lot of people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  There is appetite from a lot of people that want to see Democrats do something anything. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=120.5s)]
*  Now, of course, this is still, you know, it's a it's a optics play in general. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  And I hope the lessons that the Democrats learn from this isn't make an optics play with no tangible results, but instead to actually recognize that people are very angry. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=134.1s)]
*  People have a lot of resentment towards this administration and to organize and to mobilize. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=147.6s)]
*  I do fear that liberals will only learn the wrong lesson from this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=153.0s)]
*  But as long as this is a democracy that we can still protect the power of the people is greater than the people in power. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  If they use their powers, a great African American woman author once said the most common way people give up their power is not realizing they have it in the first place. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  I've been calling out names, folks, to tell them they have power. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  I read the stories of Deanna, of Wendy and Cassie, of Tanya, of Cameron, of Jean, of Susan, of Edna, of Randy, of Dylan, of Teresa, of Pamela, of Sally, of Mike, of Carol, of Rosemary, of Danielle, of Judith, of Elizabeth, of Sandra, Alicia, Maggie, Nibel, Laura, Michael, Robin, Mary, Allison, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  Ash, Roseanne, Carrie, Samantha P., Raphael, Will, Anthony, Sean, and so many more. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=198.1s)]
*  I read their stories here because while we were elected, they are the power of our country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=204.5s)]
*  I've made mistakes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=214.4s)]
*  We all have. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  Both parties have a lot of mistakes to account for. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  The ballast of this country, what will anchor us to our ideals, what will call us to new heights, lift our heads, lift our hopes, what will call us to rise is each other. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=220.1s)]
*  We need each other. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=237.9s)]
*  We need a greater love in this country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=241.5s)]
*  We need a greater fight in this country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  We need a greater determination. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=246.0s)]
*  We can't act as if this is normal times. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  These people's stories that I wrote were calling out for help. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  Senator, help me. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=254.4s)]

*  I'm a veteran. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  Look what happened to me. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=259.0s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=259.8s)]
*  I fought for this country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=260.5s)]

*  Help me. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=262.1s)]

*  Help. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=266.5s)]
*  People calling out for help. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  And what Americans do when people are calling out for help? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  They built an infrastructure. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=274.6s)]
*  The greatest project ever called it the Underground Railroad where Quakers, white folks, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=278.0s)]
*  joined with black folks to shuttle people to freedom. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=282.8s)]
*  What do they do when people are worried and fearful? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=285.5s)]
*  They called people together from across our country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=291.3s)]
*  Let's have a conference. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=293.6s)]
*  Let's go to Seneca Falls. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  What did they do when they faced violence? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=295.8s)]
*  Well, look at the people at Stonewall who stood up, who pushed back, who organized, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=299.3s)]
*  who won. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=304.9s)]
*  What do they do when the dark dogs are unleashed on us? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=307.7s)]
*  The fire holes are unleashed on us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  Look at what they did in Selma. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  He's loving this dude. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm getting close to a record folks, but... [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  There's a room here in the Senate named after Strom Thurmond. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=334.9s)]
*  To hate him is wrong. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=344.2s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  Maybe my ego got too caught up that if I stood here, maybe, maybe, just maybe I could break this record. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=347.4s)]
*  The man who tried to stop the rights upon which I stand. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=352.2s)]
*  I'm not here though because of his speech. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=357.4s)]
*  I'm here despite his speech. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=362.9s)]
*  Like the irony is that Strom Thurmond did that for a specific purpose, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=371.7s)]
*  So that, you know, people like Cory Booker, black people, would never be able to, you know, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  would never have the same liberties as white people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=381.29999999999995s)]
*  Like Cory Booker is doing this right now in this very moment against no, no bill, no policy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=387.1s)]
*  It is so perfectly Democrat party, like modern day Democrat party. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=396.1s)]
*  By the way, Strom was also a Democrat, ironically enough. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=409.6s)]
*  And a good Christian man, man of faith, simply said, every one of us needs mercy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=410.70000000000005s)]
*  Randy Fine won. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  Every one of us needs redemption. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=418.70000000000005s)]
*  Against Josh Whale. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  I hugged him. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  We wept and I looked at the boy. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  Damn, they came in close. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=426.3s)]
*  John? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  Would the senator yield for a question? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=430.1s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, it's the only time in my life I can tell you no. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=432.20000000000005s)]
*  I want to tell you a question. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=435.4s)]
*  Do you know you have just broken the record? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=437.09999999999997s)]
*  Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=439.9s)]
*  Do you know how proud America is of you? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  All right, so Rosario Dawson on Twitter. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=445.4s)]
*  Cory Booker just asked his girlfriend, Rosario Dawson, why his girlfriend likes Bernie more than him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=447.2s)]
*  This is the throwing themselves on the railroad tracks they promised. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  No, it's not because there's no train. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=461.7s)]
*  No, this is Democrats throwing themselves. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=465.0s)]
*  This is Cory Booker throwing himself on the railroad track after the train killed like [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=467.4s)]
*  30 families and then passed by and he knows there's no new train coming. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=471.6s)]
*  And it's crazy that oh God liberals liberals are eating dude. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=478.3s)]
*  Liberals are eating this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=483.3s)]
*  We all laughed at him, but who's laughing now? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=485.6s)]
*  I don't even like corporate. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=488.3s)]
*  This is exactly the kind of performance should Democrats should be doing when there's more [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=489.8s)]
*  substantial option available. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=492.9s)]
*  Also, this is why it's nice to have senators under the age of 70. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean that is true. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=497.4s)]
*  I do not wish to take away from this moment, but I think the best way to honor this great [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=498.4s)]
*  accomplishment to our guests in the gallery to make a rare exception and let you stand [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=503.4s)]
*  to show your appreciation. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=508.0s)]
*  I will not constrain my fellow senators. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=509.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=512.9s)]
*  I'm Chuck Schumer. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=514.0s)]
*  I have I have yielded for a question and you asked me did I know I know now. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=514.6999999999999s)]
*  I want to not quite wrap this up yet. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=523.8s)]
*  I want it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=532.5s)]
*  I don't want to wrap this up yet. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=534.0s)]
*  My mom's senator. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=536.3s)]
*  My mom's been watching. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=538.1s)]
*  I know Catherine Cortez Masto has a podium in front of her. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=539.0s)]
*  She can give me a rest. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=542.0s)]
*  I'd like to go a little further if we can just a little further. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=542.8s)]
*  I love it again. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=545.5s)]
*  I know people are trying to train each other and are all of our media operations. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=547.6999999999999s)]
*  They give the worst images of the people of the other party. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=552.3s)]
*  But I want to tell you one of the funny tweets my staff gave me is something Ted Cruz said [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=556.0s)]

*  He said maybe I should pull a fire alarm. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  He's going to break my record. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to pause in a moment. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=571.0s)]
*  If how is this a filibuster if it's not filibustering any is it just yapping. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=572.5s)]
*  Yes it is my mother but I do want to just say again two points to make if I can one [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=575.8s)]
*  is how grateful I am. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=580.9s)]
*  So do you hate this stuff because I don't know personally when we do the only thing [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=582.0s)]
*  that I get annoyed by is that Democrats think this is this is a pure optics play which [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=586.4s)]
*  is fine. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=592.7s)]
*  I don't have an issue with a pure optics play. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=593.6s)]
*  Okay, but Democrats like the base will get really excited at this and will go. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=596.4s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=602.8s)]
*  You've given us nothing but we're happy that you're at least like wasting energy. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=603.8s)]
*  He's not delaying anything. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=610.3s)]
*  There's no there's no like bill that he is delaying. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=611.6s)]
*  I mean if he goes long enough, maybe he can eventually they're going to have to pass a [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=615.5s)]
*  bill. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=619.1s)]
*  He'll delay that funding goes below 90 percent. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=619.6s)]
*  They stopped the Medicaid expansion. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  My staff really worked hard to not make this just Democratic voices to make it people in [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=624.7s)]

*  No, Manhattan Institute is not an honest arbiter. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=642.5s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=645.3s)]
*  They are literally responsible for Christopher Ruffo de IC RT all of that shit came for the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=646.6s)]
*  Manhattan Institute liberals. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=652.5s)]
*  Oh my God people don't have to hand it to the Manhattan Institute man. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=654.7s)]
*  Even with Cato when it comes to immigration. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=658.9s)]
*  Sure, but Cato is a libertarian think tank the free talking about it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=661.1s)]
*  It's such a good job bringing together authorities on both sides of the aisle. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=664.3s)]
*  I just want to thank them. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=667.3s)]
*  I want to thank my cousin Pam my family cousin Pam like Chris Murphy was here for the whole [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=668.2s)]
*  time. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=673.2s)]
*  I want to thank Chris Murphy again. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=673.6s)]
*  Who never stopped telling me we could do this. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  We can do this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  We can do this and said I will stay with you. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=686.4000000000001s)]
*  He's been with me on the floor. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=688.6s)]
*  I hope you don't look as tired as I look beat man. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=690.9000000000001s)]
*  Do I look that bad? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=695.4000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=698.9000000000001s)]
*  I want to go a little bit past this and then I'm going to I'm going to deal with some of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  the biological urgencies I'm feeling. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  But I'm going to wait here because I have the power. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=715.0s)]
*  I have the floor. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=717.5s)]
*  Somebody has to ask me perhaps from my mom's state the way that's supposed to work. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=718.1s)]
*  So will the good senator from New Jersey yield? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=723.3s)]
*  I don't think it's a net negative. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=729.5s)]
*  It's a net negative if it's a net negative if the Democrats are like this is the way which [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=731.0s)]
*  is a filibuster without any real direction any bill. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=737.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=741.5999999999999s)]
*  And just simply for the simply an optics play then it's a net negative. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=742.1999999999999s)]
*  If the Democrats recognize the the popular momentum behind even fucking optics plays like [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=747.3s)]
*  this that causes them to go. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=754.9s)]
*  Okay, we have to resist. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=756.9s)]
*  We have to resist no matter what like we have to do something anything. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=758.3s)]
*  So as it stands, it's a net neutral. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  I will say it's positive because at least the Democrats are doing something. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=764.6s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=768.6s)]
*  But if the lessons that they learn from this which is likely to be the lesson that they [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=770.6s)]
*  will learn from this is that we don't really have to do anything. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=777.1s)]
*  We just have to like optically make moves like this like make PR moves like this and [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=780.5s)]
*  say Trump is bad. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=786.3000000000001s)]
*  We're against Donald Trump but never at a moment when they actually have to do it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=788.1s)]
*  And I know people are going to fucking yell at me and say how sorry you're such a fucking [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=793.1s)]
*  leftist nuisance blah blah blah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=796.9000000000001s)]
*  Like he's doing something bold and brave or whatever. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=799.0s)]
*  But you have to understand this this should have happened last week or two weeks ago. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=802.0s)]
*  This should have happened. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=808.9s)]
*  Yeah, everyone is so proud. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=810.6s)]
*  This should have happened against the continued resolution. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=812.4s)]
*  That's where they should have filibustered a filibuster without a bill that they're [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=816.0s)]
*  stopping is not a filibuster is just yapping for it to support caregivers and their [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=819.5s)]
*  families and Congress just reauthorized this funding. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=824.7s)]
*  And now we have a president that has not the one homie that's too old man. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=828.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you actually what this is. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=833.4000000000001s)]
*  I want to add praise and appreciation for Senator Booker. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=839.0s)]
*  Hope he's able to keep going. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=841.0s)]
*  Pros of them asking him questions. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=842.0s)]
*  Thank you Senator Booker. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=843.2s)]
*  You're such an inspiration. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=844.0s)]
*  Yeah people are that fucking desperate. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=845.4000000000001s)]
*  I look at this. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=848.1s)]
*  It's symbolic you idiot. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=849.4000000000001s)]
*  Wait what? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=853.8000000000001s)]
*  Research when there was not enough health care. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=854.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm the one who's saying it's symbolic. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=858.1s)]
*  I'm saying it's symbolic if it's pure symbolism and the Democrats only go after [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=861.9000000000001s)]
*  pure symbolism and not direct action then it's just symbolism. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=867.1s)]
*  Why are fucking liberals literally still doing this after Donald Trump has put his [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=872.8000000000001s)]
*  dick through every orifice of the fucking federal administrative state. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=878.9000000000001s)]
*  What are you saying right now? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=882.7s)]
*  This is no in a way. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=884.6s)]
*  Maybe it's not as herculean of a task of Nancy Pelosi kneeling because she is physically [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=887.6s)]
*  incapable of doing such things but it is an analog to Nancy Pelosi kneeling with a [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=892.1999999999999s)]
*  kente cloth. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=896.8s)]
*  You understand that right? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=897.6s)]
*  That's symbolism. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=899.6s)]
*  Las Vegas. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=901.1s)]
*  And he's continued continued to cut the grant for essential research for so many [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=903.0s)]
*  reasons. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=908.5s)]
*  We've seen these funding cuts. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=909.3s)]
*  We've seen mass layoffs and the impoundment of grants that have already been proved by [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=910.6s)]
*  Congress. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=915.5s)]
*  This is a violation of the rule of law and you have been talking about that for the [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=916.0s)]
*  last couple of hours. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=920.4s)]
*  President Trump is forgetting that this is personal. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=921.8000000000001s)]
*  It is happening to so many families. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=924.6s)]
*  So my question Senator Booker to you is what do you think families and caregivers of [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=926.9s)]
*  those impacted by all Alzheimer's how they are feeling about what is happening right [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=934.4s)]
*  now? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=939.7s)]
*  So this bothers me for two reasons and the first you've already mentioned is this is [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=941.1s)]
*  the points of bipartisan work that we do. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=945.7s)]
*  I talked about Chris Murphy part of Booker's comments about this Congress getting exposure [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=949.4s)]
*  and traction in DC dominated by Trump GOP seems like a mission at least somewhat accomplished. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=953.2s)]
*  Is that some of that community violence intervention money that I work so hard to get in [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=957.4s)]
*  that bill is being clawed back by a president. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=961.5s)]
*  There are people in this room. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=963.6s)]
*  I know so many of you and I know on the other side that have done such great work to work [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=964.7s)]
*  with our colleagues to find common ground and get really important programs past that [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=970.3s)]
*  bring resources to families and it's being clawed back by your president not with consultation [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=975.5s)]
*  not with a hearing not with a discussion of even why you would target Alzheimer's [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=981.4s)]
*  research. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=988.0999999999999s)]
*  That is a violation of the separation of powers and I wish my Republican colleagues would [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=992.9s)]
*  hold more hearings about that. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=998.1999999999999s)]
*  These are programs that they like I saw that with USAID. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1000.4s)]
*  I worked with Marco Rubio on some of that programs and those investments that are now [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1004.0s)]
*  been cut and clawed back. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1008.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder why so it's a separation of powers issues. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1009.5s)]
*  It's an offense to the common goals that we share in this community of leaders. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1012.9s)]
*  But the second reason it bothers me is an article I read hours ago by Fareed Zakari. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1020.3s)]
*  You want Schumer's boss so bad. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  This has to be at least just a little selfish to push for that leadership spot, right? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1025.8s)]
*  I mean that cuts so dramatically. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1029.1s)]
*  What is one of the best taxpayer investment? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1031.5s)]
*  He's not filibustering anything chatters. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1033.5s)]
*  He's not he's not he just filibusted is some bitches. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1035.4s)]
*  Okay, he's not filibustering anything. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1038.3s)]
*  Get five dollars back for your economy. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1040.9s)]
*  Folks will be invested in that vehicle. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1044.3s)]
*  Well, that's NIH funding. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1046.5s)]
*  Every dollar you invest who would cut a profit center. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1049.4s)]
*  It's not just a profit center. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1052.9s)]
*  I think my analysis of Congress is that every single one of them even the ones I like, okay, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1055.1000000000001s)]
*  and there's not many is that they're all a bunch of vultures, letcherous sharks. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1062.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1067.8s)]
*  And therefore that is the framework that I analyze their movements through for me right [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1069.6000000000001s)]
*  now. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1077.9s)]
*  There's a knife fight behind the scenes in the Democratic Party for who will lead the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1078.2s)]
*  way in 2028. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1083.4s)]
*  That's why Chris Murphy is doing what he's been doing. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1085.0s)]
*  I'm sure he's not very excited about what Cory Booker has been doing as well because [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1087.9s)]
*  it kind of takes away from what he's been trying to do. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1091.8000000000002s)]
*  And that's why Cory Booker has been doing this. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1094.4s)]
*  Okay, that's it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1097.5s)]
*  It's not the party propping him up. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1099.9s)]
*  He's using the the influence that he has as a senator to be able to do such things. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1101.3000000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1106.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's also the reason why Chuck Schumer inserted himself in that last moment to tell [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1107.3s)]
*  him that he was there for the record break. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1117.1s)]
*  Will they be Democratic values or will be the values of the country that's competing [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1119.5s)]
*  with us to beat us and right now we're giving them a head start? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1123.1999999999998s)]
*  And then the final reason that question bothers me is because my father died of Parkinson's [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1128.6s)]
*  and his Murphy's been with him all night. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1132.0s)]
*  No, I'm saying I'm saying Chris Murphy probably hates this. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  Personally, because he's like damn it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1137.5s)]
*  He took the spotlight away from me. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1139.6999999999998s)]
*  I assume always that they're in contest with one another for party leadership. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1142.8s)]
*  In Georgia and so many people here and if I was Chris Murphy, I'd be fucking see the movie [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1147.1s)]
*  theater. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1151.8999999999999s)]
*  And my did you hear his love for Israel rants? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1152.3s)]
*  Oh my God, you need to take your dad to the bathroom. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1154.1999999999998s)]
*  I never imagined my years with my dad as a two year old and three year old taking me [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1156.6999999999998s)]

*  So in this Atlanta movie theater. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1163.5s)]
*  In the middle of a movie, which I was like, okay, it's time for me to do this ritual that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1166.1000000000001s)]

*  I've got you have gone on the war criminal when he was in America. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1187.3s)]
*  So many families know this and and and my ego, I'm sorry. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1192.8s)]
*  I was leaning over. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1195.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm saying wait a minute. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1196.5s)]
*  I'm in a public bathroom leaning over and buckling another man's pants, please. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1197.2s)]
*  Please God don't let somebody come in and as if God heard my call someone walked in. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1200.7s)]
*  And I hear the person walk and I'm like, just please keep walking go into a stall. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1208.3999999999999s)]
*  Please keep walking. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1211.1s)]
*  And then suddenly I hear the feet walk past me and stop. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1212.1s)]
*  And then the man turns around. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1215.7s)]
*  And says, oh my God, Cory Booker. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1218.5s)]
*  And then I look up at my dad and I see the clarity in his eyes. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1222.3s)]
*  There is he is a hundred percent. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1228.8999999999999s)]

*  Christopher Murphy Alzheimer's is devastating. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1235.5s)]
*  So many American families who are watching the loved one of their lives diminish. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1239.0s)]
*  And we're cutting funding. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1245.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is cutting funding democratically bipartisan Lee approved. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1246.1s)]
*  So forget the separation of powers. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1251.8s)]
*  It's important. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1254.5s)]
*  So important. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1255.8s)]
*  If that doesn't get you then maybe think about the competition with China. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1256.8s)]
*  If that doesn't get you those two don't get you America. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1260.8s)]
*  Think about how much more we can do for Israel. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=1265.5s)]

*  would you agree with me that there has been no consultation with Congress about [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2150.4s)]
*  any effort to move USAID into the Department of State and that because Congress created this agency, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2158.7s)]
*  Congress has got to be involved in reauthorizing whatever comes next and that this president and [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2166.8s)]
*  his Doge boys need to understand that before they take any more steps at USAID. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2176.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, you and I both know. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2184.4s)]
*  And in a bipartisan way, we created some of these programs principally to keep America safe. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2188.3s)]
*  Many of us remember that dramatic hearing where Trump's Secretary of Defense, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2193.5s)]
*  James Mattis, sat before the American people when they were discussing the budgets for USAID and the State Department. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2197.1s)]
*  And John Mattis knew the power of those programs to keep us safe. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2207.6s)]
*  You mentioned infectious diseases when we live in a world where infectious disease anywhere is a threat to public health everywhere. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2212.1s)]
*  So pulling our scientists out of the fight against Ebola, pulling our scientists out of drug resistant tuberculosis fights, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2219.1000000000004s)]
*  it makes no sense. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2228.0s)]
*  And then in terms of our safety, he just simply said if you hopefully this is a changing tide. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2230.9s)]
*  Have you ever tried not being a hypocrite? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2238.2000000000003s)]
*  No, a true socialist would send me to Tokyo. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2240.1000000000004s)]
*  A true socialist would pay off my debt. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2243.9s)]
*  You ever think you'll be true to your word? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2246.6s)]
*  That was rage bait. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2248.3999999999996s)]
*  Forgive me, but I will do it again. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2249.5s)]
*  Have you ever tried not being a hypocrite? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2251.3999999999996s)]
*  Lord, forgive me. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2256.2999999999997s)]
*  I will rage bait again. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2257.2s)]
*  I've done it once. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2258.3999999999996s)]
*  I've done it twice. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2259.2999999999997s)]
*  I will do it three more times until I get banned. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2261.6s)]
*  Catch me in the wrong moment because right now I'm not angry. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2266.1s)]
*  Ambassadors from other countries where we had the moral authority to tell them you're not doing enough. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2271.0s)]
*  And in the Myanmar crisis right now, as Chris Kuhn said, who's standing there? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2276.2s)]
*  Not Americans. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2285.3999999999996s)]
*  We don't have the capacity anymore to help. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2286.8999999999996s)]
*  A horrific crisis like that, but Chinese government's there. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2291.0s)]
*  Again, it's what defines us. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2298.2s)]
*  I keep saying this is not a left-right moment. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2300.2s)]
*  This is a moral moment. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2303.2s)]
*  And we tell our truth with what we do with our resources. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2304.7s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2307.2999999999997s)]
*  When you poll people and ask them how much money you spend on USID, they say, oh, it must be 10% of the American budget. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2308.4s)]
*  It must be 5% of the American budget. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2312.4s)]
*  It's around 1% or less. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2314.1s)]
*  A penny of what tax dollars you send down to Washington goes to help us make sure that around the globe, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2317.0s)]
*  we're countering the hard power of some countries with the power of our light and our soft power. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2323.9s)]
*  We have been the envy of the world where people see and know how special America is [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2330.1s)]
*  because we live the value of every major religion, that we're going to love our neighbors, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2334.2999999999997s)]
*  we're going to be there for you in your times of need. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2338.4s)]
*  And we all know with a terrorist group from Faroq attack that in a lot of these countries, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2340.2999999999997s)]
*  terrorist groups are trying to counter the democratic governments there. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2347.2999999999997s)]
*  Look in the Sahel region. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2350.1s)]
*  Look what's happening. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2353.9s)]
*  I was in Nigeria. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2354.5s)]
*  I was shocked to say what they're talking about. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2355.2s)]
*  Instabilities in the north, the threats of terrorism in the north. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2358.6s)]
*  I'm going to go for seven more minutes and stop. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2365.5s)]
*  But I want to use these last seven minutes to return one more time to the people of my state [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2368.6s)]
*  and actually other states who demanded we do things different. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2376.0s)]
*  Who asked for help. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2381.2s)]
*  Before I do, I just want to thank Mike Lee today. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2382.7999999999997s)]
*  He's my partner in antitrust, a specialty of my friend. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2386.0s)]
*  Why did you vote for Trump? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2390.3999999999996s)]
*  And I texted him. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2392.1s)]
*  He's making America great. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2393.0s)]
*  Goddamn it. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2394.2999999999997s)]
*  That's why I said to you, I'm kind of going to the floor to hold it for as long as I can. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2394.8999999999996s)]
*  And I may not make our first subcommittee together on antitrust where we have a lot of common ground. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2400.7999999999997s)]
*  So I'm sorry. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2406.2999999999997s)]
*  I missed it today. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2406.7999999999997s)]
*  I know you'll fill me in, but I know my friend filled in. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2407.3999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2410.0s)]
*  So I want to close back where we started about us about why I'm here. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2412.5s)]
*  I believe I know USAID does like it has those have decent programs in terms of combating famine and stuff. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2417.8999999999996s)]
*  But like as this chatter also correctly pointed out any moment that you spend talking about USAID inside [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2425.3999999999996s)]
*  of Congress without simply hyper focusing on like how it's basically another subsidy for American farmers [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2432.8999999999996s)]
*  that Trump is taking away. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2439.7999999999997s)]
*  Is a wasted moment and every moment that you talk about USAID instead of talking about the erosion of due process [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2442.1s)]
*  the erosion of fucking First Amendment rights things that Americans do definitely care about or rather the [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2448.1s)]
*  affordability crisis that Trump is only accelerating instead of fixing even though he claimed he was going to fix [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2453.8999999999996s)]
*  it is a moment wasted. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2458.7s)]
*  I don't think Americans broadly give a fuck about USAID despite the fact that Democrats have talked about it [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2461.7s)]
*  endlessly and the average Americans mind USAID is just like, you know, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2466.1s)]
*  trying to trans little kids in Baghdad. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2470.8s)]
*  That's what they think is going on with Trans-Sesame Street. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2473.7000000000003s)]
*  That's what they think. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2476.5s)]
*  And I like obviously there are benefits of the program. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2477.8s)]
*  You could talk about that if you want that's understandable in order to combat the misinformation. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2482.5s)]
*  But overall it is not something that Americans by and large care about Americans do over Americans do however [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2487.7000000000003s)]
*  care about First Amendment Americans care about free speech Americans care about due process. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2494.5s)]
*  And they can be made to care about the First Amendment and due process. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2501.2000000000003s)]
*  They can be made to care about, you know, the the upcoming economic collapse being a fan of mega merch is so lame [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2505.3s)]
*  Hassan take off the fucking hat Hassan wearing the mega hat meme is the equivalent of Kanye and his hood. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2513.5s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2520.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm a political who's Hassan I'm Hank Pecker. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2521.1000000000004s)]
*  There's no other way that I can signal to people that are watching me. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2524.7000000000003s)]
*  There's no other way to signal to the people that are watching me that I am not political. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2528.6s)]
*  I am an apolitical man. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2533.2s)]
*  If you know what I mean, if you catch my drift, I'm apolitical rake up trillions and trillions of dollars in debt. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2534.7s)]
*  That our children and our children's children are going to have to pay for passing the bucks that will grow. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2543.7s)]
*  Also every single 85 year old to retirement. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2550.5s)]
*  Every single 85 year old Democratic senator is going to think Cory Booker is the greatest social media monster of all time [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2555.0s)]
*  since he posted on tik-tok and he kicked off his record-setting speech on the Senate floor last night. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2564.0s)]
*  Now he has almost half a million followers overnight and the live view on tik-tok has received more than 360 million likes. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2569.8s)]
*  So obviously they're going to say he's brilliant. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2575.9s)]
*  He's a genius. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2578.6s)]
*  He's a social media genius. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2579.3s)]
*  That's the other side of this. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2582.8s)]
*  Not all. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2584.0s)]
*  Let's not use hyperbole. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2584.7000000000003s)]
*  But most will go. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2587.3s)]
*  Most will go to the richest people in our country who I promise you. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2588.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't I celebrate people who brought their ingenuity and their expertise and their grit and their tireless work who built wealth in this country. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2593.2000000000003s)]
*  Should not be us versus them. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2602.9s)]
*  But I'm telling you that those folks do not need another tax cut and the corporations who came here. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2604.4s)]
*  You all remember it said we would like a 25% rate. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2609.7000000000003s)]
*  The people I read said that when we kicked it to 21 not even what they were asking for from 35. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2612.6000000000004s)]
*  It exploded one of the main reasons it exploded our debt and we read from conservative groups who just said all these promises that we would grow our way out of our deficit. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2619.7000000000003s)]
*  They didn't materialize all the promises that were made. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2629.2000000000003s)]
*  Trump for those who don't remember were here when I read it was going around telling folks that all my tariffs. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2633.7000000000003s)]
*  This is 2017 my tariffs the money that I get. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2638.7000000000003s)]
*  That will be what we could pay down the debt. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2641.2s)]
*  The math that they did was that would account for about one 750th of the debt at that time. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2645.1s)]
*  But he used that money to try to compensate the farmers that he was hurting with his tariffs. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2651.3999999999996s)]
*  This is a moral moment and people are getting hurt and people are afraid because of the threats to Medicaid cuts. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2657.3999999999996s)]
*  There are people writing in and said 880 billion would devastate me. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2662.3999999999996s)]
*  But even small cuts to services by whole family fragile architecture of our finances. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2666.4s)]
*  If you just pull out the transportation money that my disabled child uses that will crumble my financial world. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2673.8s)]
*  And so when you talk about the bigger cuts, we know the math many states who expanded Medicare have a trigger that if it goes below 90% all the Medicare expansion goes off in that state and millions of Americans. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2681.6s)]
*  Will be hurt. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2695.4s)]
*  That's not right guys. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2695.9s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2696.9s)]
*  And so this is the choices we have before us. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2697.9s)]
*  Our veterans and the VA you a man that you now you made me get very emotional with your story. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2701.2000000000003s)]

*  We read the stories of the poems of the unknown soldier looking over us and saying what are you doing to the Gold Star families? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2710.7000000000003s)]

*  Are you living up to your promises that you made? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2718.9s)]
*  Well right now with the cuts of tens of thousands over 80,000 veterans who work for the VA but even more because about 20% or so of all federal workers are veterans and we read stories from veterans in America who are shaken by what's happening who are losing their jobs because but yet all they want to do is serve. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2721.0s)]
*  They're not what they're being called. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2740.8s)]
*  They're not leeches. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2742.8s)]
*  They're not criminals. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2744.3s)]
*  They shouldn't be degraded for wanting to continue to serve their nation. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2746.0s)]
*  This is what we're talking about our veterans our seniors our health care our financial security going forward. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2749.4s)]
*  I asked the question to all those people who voted for Donald Trump who believed in him that he would lower your grocery prices. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2755.4s)]
*  I asked you look at your financial self. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2762.4s)]
*  Are you better off than you were 72 years ago financially? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2765.4s)]
*  Well the answer for most people who believed in him is no because he didn't set out to do anything to lower prices. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2768.4s)]
*  He set out to rename the Gulf of Mexico to threaten Canada to say I'm going to take over Greenland. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2774.5s)]
*  He's done a lot of things 140 executive orders many of them actually drive up your costs make it more expensive to enroll in the ACA reduce a lot of the tax credits they increased your costs taxed your bedrock services. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2779.5s)]

*  Consumer confidence is down. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2799.6s)]
*  This is what the voices we brought into this chamber the voices are constituents red states blue states the voices of Democrats and Republicans Republican governors Democratic governors. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2806.6s)]
*  We brought all the people that are saying no this is a moral moment not left to right right or wrong. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2816.6s)]
*  And so I've tried over the last 25 hours in one minute. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2821.7s)]
*  To center the conversation back on what will we do of good conscience. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2827.7s)]
*  People who are saying I serve this country I risked my life shouldn't be able to keep my job people are saying this country once made itself the envy of the world because we invested in high quality education for every child I don't like what's going on. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2834.7s)]
*  The end of the Department of Education people are saying I worked harder than I ever have but the prices on everything in my life are getting higher people were saying that America I learned about in school the one where people's rights are protected the people are saying that why are we yet again going to another health care battle threatens millions of people the people are saying that I'm worried about the financial security in the future of my country the voices of folks. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2845.7999999999997s)]
*  Why would any normal person watch this I mean abnormal television loving libs love this look at this they love this shit. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2867.9s)]
*  I don't know how to stop us from going down this road Chuck Schumer's now told me that they're greasing the skids to do these things I'm sorry but I know who does have the power. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2874.9s)]
*  The people of the United States of America. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2884.9s)]
*  The people of the United States of America. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2888.0s)]
*  The power of the people is greater than the people in power it is time to heed the words of the man I began this whole thing with John Lewis I beg folks to take his example of his early days where he made himself determined to show his love for his country the time the country didn't love him. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2891.0s)]
*  To love this country so much to be such a patriot that he endured beatings savagely on the Edmund Pettus bridge at lunch counters on freedom rides he said he had to do something he would not normalize a moment like this. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2909.1s)]
*  He would not just go along with business and usual. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2924.1s)]
*  He wouldn't know how to solve it but there's one thing that he would do that I hope we all can do that I think I did a little bit of tonight. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2929.1s)]
*  He said for us to go out and cause some good trouble necessary trouble to redeem the soul of our nation I want you to redeem the dream let's be bold in America. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2935.2s)]
*  Necessary trouble. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2947.2999999999997s)]
*  To redeem the soul of our nation I want you to redeem the dream let's be bold in America. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2950.2999999999997s)]
*  Not to be in a great Americans not divide us against each other let's be bolder in America with a vision that inspires. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2958.2999999999997s)]
*  With hope it starts with the people of the United States of America that's how this country started we the people. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2967.2999999999997s)]
*  Let's get back to the ideals that others are threatening let's get back to our founding documents that those imperfect geniuses had some very special words at the end of the Declaration of Independence was one of the greatest in all of humanity declarations of interdependence. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2974.4s)]
*  When our founder said we must mutually pledge pledge to each other. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2987.5s)]
*  Our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2993.5s)]
*  We need that now from all Americans this is a moral moment it's not left or right it's right or wrong. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=2997.5s)]
*  It's getting good trouble. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3009.5s)]
*  My friend Madam President. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3011.5s)]
*  I yield the floor. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3015.5s)]
*  God damn. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3017.5s)]
*  Powerful moments from. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3021.5s)]
*  Democrats erupt in thunderous applause after 25 entire hours. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3024.5s)]
*  Of Cory Booker protesting against the Trump administration by doing a 25 hour filibuster that was not actually filibusting against or delaying against any sort of bill that was going to pass. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3032.5s)]
*  Thank you to the pages thank you to the parliamentarian stand now he's doing now he's calling out the gift subs 25 hours at least the happy vegan. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3045.6s)]
*  So as I've said already and I tweeted about this my profile I think ultimately it's not a bad thing that they are doing these kinds of optical actions rather than no action whatsoever I said I do like the day I'm doing this. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3057.6s)]
*  The Dems are finally doing something and it's clearly popular but this filibuster should have been a real one against the CR that Schumer whipped cloture votes on. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3075.6s)]
*  There's a lot of real appetite from the base for resistance hope it's not just for optics overall I'm not going to criticize Democrats for finally doing anything and clearly the analytics show that the base wants this. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3083.6s)]
*  If it doesn't go beyond optics like Nancy Neely with a kente cloth the Dems are going to get pummeled again. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3093.6s)]
*  I said show made Hassan no I will not be showing myself as a sexy maid you've seen it under my replies every single time. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3098.7s)]
*  Now there's a lot of there's a lot that gets lost and before people say you know because I saw some liberals on Twitter being like you would love this if Bernie did this dog. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3108.7s)]
*  I've also criticized like and demanded more from Bernie Sanders and AOC as well as they go out all across the country and do these kinds of demonstrations. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3119.7999999999997s)]
*  These meetings these rallies the people need more there needs to be more than just words at this point proud Iowan is a dedicated public servant and accomplished leader a loving thought. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3131.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay anyway. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3144.9s)]
*  The point is the point I'm making is that this is good the bar is in hell and Cory Booker today cleared it okay. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3147.9s)]
*  He cleared it. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3158.9s)]
*  And the Democrats are giving a tremendous amount of praise to him for clearing that low bar that is already in hell. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3160.9s)]
*  That is already in hell. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3169.0s)]
*  Why do people keep saying that about you what that thing what about me that I that I'm a sexy maid though you're talking about or that the bar is in hell. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3171.0s)]
*  What are you talking about you're wrong on this one. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3180.0s)]
*  Yeah they'll use any enthusiasm to cynically push more little bullshit and you know it. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3182.0s)]
*  No that's my suspicion as well but I don't I don't want to be fucking angry and cynical all the time. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3187.0s)]
*  Okay give me an opportunity to hope please the audacity to hope Brock Hussein Obama. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3194.1s)]
*  That's it. I don't think so. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3201.1s)]
*  I don't think that that is I don't think that the Democrats are going to learn a lesson from this that you know that they need to do more to resist against the Trump administration. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3203.1s)]
*  I think the lesson that they're going to learn is the yeah if the Dem caucus did have as many hours of each filibuster they would grind the Senate gears down to a stop for weeks. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3212.1s)]
*  What Booker did was great but we need the rest of the caucus to stand up to that's number one. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3220.2s)]
*  Number two that would actually be a hurdle that would place a hurdle in front of congressional action which would be good. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3224.2s)]
*  Okay that's what we need to do. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3236.2s)]
*  We need to place hurdles in against congressional action and use every moment that you place hurdles against congressional action with good messaging. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3239.2s)]
*  Good messaging that revolves around key policy is key policies that the Trump administration is enacting the harms that they're committing against the American population. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3248.2999999999997s)]
*  No positive party this one annoys me against some fellow that this is y'all can't create coalitions if you're unwilling to give flowers were due. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3259.2999999999997s)]
*  Most people are not courageous and Booker's filibuster is objectively an act of courage and protest. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3265.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay I wouldn't go that fucking far. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3269.2999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean it's an act of protest for sure but what do you mean it's an act of courage. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3271.2999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean it's an act of courage. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3277.4s)]
*  The person that you're talking about got $750,000 from AIPAC entertained Yoav Galant is an unimaginably pro-Israel congressperson and is directly in the pocket of Big Pharma as he's a New Jersey state senator and Johnson and Johnson is a major donor for him. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3279.4s)]
*  Okay calm down I might know a little bit more than you do about Cory Booker's background perhaps especially considering that I am also originally from New Jersey. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3296.4s)]
*  Having said that as I've also maintained as I've also repeated over and over again it's not a bad thing. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3306.5s)]
*  What he did was objectively good but I also must caution folks I also must caution folks to not think that this is this is it you know we need to do more. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3312.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3326.5s)]
*  Rare Hassan L. Oh okay. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3328.6s)]
*  Many of you that have liberal leanings and liberal tendencies have said this to me. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3330.6s)]
*  There's a reason why you're still in here and there's a reason why you go okay maybe you were wrong maybe you were right on this and maybe I was wrong on this. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3338.6s)]
*  Okay my fear and my caution here is simply and it's not even about the fucking Yoav Galant pro-Israel dick riding shit. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3346.7s)]
*  Okay my fear here is that the Democrats have two options. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3357.7s)]
*  They look to left populism coming from Bernie and they look to what Cory Booker did here today. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3365.7s)]
*  Both are optics focused both are not direct tangible action. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3372.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay I love Bernie Sanders and AOC and you know they're the closest to me politically even though I have many disagreements with them including Bernie Sanders specifically on Israel. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3378.7999999999997s)]
*  Having said that I have great respect for them and yet. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3388.7999999999997s)]
*  And yet. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3394.9s)]
*  And yet. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3396.9s)]
*  I have also cautioned that the rallies that they hold all around the country are good. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3398.9s)]
*  It's good at it's good at getting people excited it's getting people in through the it's good at getting people enthusiastic. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3406.9s)]
*  But if it stays there and it's not enough. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3412.9s)]
*  If it's not associated with like some kind of organizing initiative then it's not enough then all you're doing is is experiencing catharsis. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3417.0s)]
*  So if I have that same criticism for Bernard Sanders and AOC then of course I'm going to have that same criticism if not more for someone like Cory Booker. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3429.0s)]
*  It's good that he did this. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3437.0s)]
*  I hope to take away from the Democratic Party for these actions isn't. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3439.0s)]
*  Oh yeah we can symbolically stand. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3443.1s)]
*  And do a filibuster against no bill whatsoever and just talk. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3449.1s)]
*  And then people will get excited for us once again people will give us money once again if that's the best takeaway here then this country is cooked. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3455.1s)]
*  Because it doesn't meet the standard of what the Republicans are doing. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3467.2s)]
*  It does not meet the standard of what the Republicans have done so far and what they plan to do. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3473.2s)]
*  It's a shit ton of violence that they're enacting on a daily basis. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3481.2s)]
*  You understand what I mean. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3491.2s)]
*  You understand. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtGcnoZeAD4&t=3493.2s)]
