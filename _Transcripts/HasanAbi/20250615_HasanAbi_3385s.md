# Israel Is On FIRE | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc)
*  This is Israel's getting lit up right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=0.0s)]
*  Yo! [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3.72s)]
*  Okay, that one definitely hit. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=11.92s)]
*  I think like... [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=13.0s)]
*  I feel like Israel might have actually diminished [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=14.96s)]
*  the Iranian strike capabilities low-key. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=16.96s)]
*  Because anytime there's like missile alerts, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=20.76s)]
*  anytime there's any sort of missile alerts, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=22.92s)]
*  it seems like... [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=24.8s)]
*  I mean, we can't see anything from this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=26.36s)]
*  This is tiny. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=27.92s)]
*  But anytime there's missile alerts, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=28.64s)]
*  there isn't... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  There's just sirens, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  but then you don't see the missiles. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=33.28s)]
*  Ballistic missiles seem departing Iran bound for Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  That's a lot of missiles, man. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=38.04s)]
*  Red Alert just hit. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=39.64s)]
*  Probably not going to hit Tel Aviv. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  I don't think it will be. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  I wonder what they're targeting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=43.800000000000004s)]
*  They did see a lot of success in Haifa. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=46.88s)]
*  Additional footage of ballistic missiles. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=59.56s)]
*  Departing Iran. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=63.68s)]
*  The IDF told Israelis to stop posting videos of the Iranian missiles [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=80.28s)]
*  so it doesn't disclose the Iron Dome strategic launch places [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=83.0s)]
*  and it's not used by Iranian propaganda. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=85.4s)]
*  Haifa skyline. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=89.0s)]
*  Sirens sounded. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  Oh, they got... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  See, that got intercepted. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  OSINT claims this is an unorganized attack. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=97.44s)]
*  Incoming Jerusalem. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  There are new locations marked on the map. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=101.36s)]
*  What the... [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=108.6s)]
*  That's got to be military positions, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=112.32s)]
*  Missile seen right now over Tel Aviv. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=119.6s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=121.6s)]
*  What the... [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=124.28s)]
*  Al Jazeera has... [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=137.48s)]
*  Whoa, that one's... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=138.48s)]
*  Holy... [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=148.6s)]
*  This is... [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=149.6s)]
*  Israel's getting lit the cup right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=150.6s)]
*  Yo! [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=178.6s)]
*  Okay, that one definitely hit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=181.6s)]
*  Goddamn. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=191.88s)]
*  Cameraman never dies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=198.88s)]
*  Oh, I'm not going to die. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=202.88s)]
*  I'm going to die. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=203.88s)]
*  I'm going to die. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=204.88s)]
*  I'm going to die. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=205.88s)]
*  I'm going to die. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=206.88s)]
*  I'm going to die. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=208.16s)]
*  Is that smoke? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=213.16s)]
*  Come on, camera. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=214.16s)]
*  That looks like it could be smoke. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=215.16s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=217.16s)]
*  Haifa cam. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=218.16s)]
*  Confirmed hit in Haifa. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=225.16s)]
*  The smoke in the Tel Aviv shot is from... [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=227.16s)]
*  AP is from the interceptor launcher next to the defense ministry. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=229.16s)]
*  I think that's it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=232.16s)]
*  That doesn't look like an interceptor launch cloud, dude. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=233.16s)]
*  Saddam Hussein back in 1980 to 88, a very different war. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=238.16s)]
*  Nothing as intense as this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=242.16s)]
*  And Israelis have never dealt with a country the size of Iran. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=244.16s)]
*  They've dealt with the likes of Hezbollah, Hamas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=248.16s)]
*  Obviously in recent years, we have to go back to the 70s last time... [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=251.16s)]
*  A ton of power out in Haifa. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=254.16s)]
*  ...in the world. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  I have questions about how long Israel and Iran can, from a military point of view, stay [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  with the intensity of hitting each other, as we've seen in the last three nights. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=264.44s)]
*  That's a question mark for me as I watch this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=268.44s)]
*  And more were launched? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=271.44s)]
*  At least from the Iranian point of view. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=272.44s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=275.44s)]
*  I sense that they do want to sort of end this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=276.44000000000005s)]
*  Diplomacy should resume. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=281.44000000000005s)]
*  As a fire near an energy facility? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=282.44000000000005s)]
*  But I don't know if the Iranians have figured out if they can come back with an offer that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  actually might work for Netanyahu. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=288.44000000000005s)]
*  It could be on enrichment, but I suspect what Netanyahu really is asking for, if he accepts [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  that the regime survives in Tehran. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  He wants a very different Iranian regional policy... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Multiple impacts recorded in Tel Aviv, Israel, and major Iranian missile launch. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  ...the Israelis call Iranian proxies that go after Israel. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=304.72s)]
*  So I'm not sure if the officials in Tehran have made up their mind, if they're ready [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=307.72s)]
*  to go there, to make a regional compromise beyond the nuclear issue. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=311.72s)]
*  But if they are willing to do that, that might just be what it takes for Trump to be able [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=317.0s)]
*  to pull the Israelis away from attacking Iran. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  And live shots of Haifa in Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  Now we know why Israeli command said sleep in a shelter tonight is going to be long night. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  So missiles have also been launched from Iran. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  So another wave of missiles towards Haifa this time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=335.12s)]
*  So multiple areas of Israel would believe that this is energy infrastructure that has [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  been targeted in this attack in Haifa. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=345.68s)]
*  Multiple impacts recorded in Haifa. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=349.68s)]
*  It seems that these tit for tat... [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=352.68s)]
*  Why is IL Red Alert making it seem like they're celebrating the hits? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=354.68s)]
*  Israel saying initially that they... [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=358.68s)]
*  I know that they're not, but like the way that they're... [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=360.68s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=364.68s)]
*  No, that's just the facility, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=365.68s)]
*  Like that's not a fire. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=368.68s)]
*  That's a fire. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=369.68s)]
*  That's just normal. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=370.68s)]
*  You will. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=371.68s)]
*  I suspect both sides will obviously survive. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=372.68s)]
*  Plenty of innocent Iranians and Israelis will suffer or die as a result. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=374.76s)]
*  But I don't think any... [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=381.76s)]
*  I mean, look, let me put it to you this way. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=384.76s)]
*  I don't want to be cold about it, but if this conflict spills over to the region, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=386.76s)]
*  and you're just talking about Haifa, I understand one of the targets in Haifa was the oil refinery. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=391.76s)]
*  The Iranians decided after Israel struck the south parts, the gas facilities in the Gulf region, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=396.76s)]
*  that they're going to return the favor by hitting energy infrastructure in Israel. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=403.84s)]
*  Interceptors are out in Tel Aviv? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=410.84s)]
*  Is it like they took out the interceptors? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=412.84s)]
*  They go from nuclear and military sites and... [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=414.84s)]
*  including energy and economic... [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=418.84s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=420.84s)]
*  She loves saving Miami. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=421.84s)]
*  And that's when you have to just be fearful that it could spill over. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=422.84s)]
*  For example, the Iranians have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=427.84s)]
*  They have said that if our energy infrastructure comes or attacked, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  then anything within our ability to reach might be a legitimate target. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  And they have said, increasing your... [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=438.91999999999996s)]
*  that they consider the United States to be involved in this. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  Again, the U.S. has billions of dollars of investment in that region. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  That might be a pressure point for... [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=446.91999999999996s)]
*  At least two interceptor launchers were hit. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  Secondary explosions were seen after hits. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  I wonder if it was next to the IDF headquarters. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  The interceptor launcher, that's the smoke that we saw. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  If that's the case, they won't release that information. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=459.0s)]
*  That's going to be... [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=461.0s)]
*  It's clear to me that they do want to end this. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=462.0s)]
*  They don't have the confidence that they can stay. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=464.0s)]
*  Of course, regardless of what they're saying in terms of their words, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=466.0s)]
*  I don't sense they have the confidence that they can stay in this game for long. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=469.0s)]
*  But remember, Iran is alone. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=473.0s)]
*  It's got no friends. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=474.0s)]
*  It's on its own. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=475.0s)]
*  Israel's got the United States, most of Europe, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=476.0s)]
*  and plenty of other friends and partners that support Israel. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=480.0s)]
*  And that should obviously be a concern for Tehran. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=483.0s)]
*  What does this mean for Deco Den? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=487.08s)]
*  No worries for all the Deco Deco fans. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=489.08s)]
*  The Deco Den will be unimpeded from the Israel-Iran conflict [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=491.08s)]
*  that's taking place currently because it is a firm and committed supporter [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=498.08s)]
*  of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=501.08s)]
*  and therefore receives no supplies from Israel. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=503.08s)]
*  From what I understand, some of the Labooboos are coming from Iran, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=507.08s)]
*  but... [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=511.08s)]
*  And that might be a problem. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=512.08s)]
*  That's probably why some of the Labooboos have not been delivered to Deco Den. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=514.1600000000001s)]
*  As you know, QT's position is one of commerce. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=521.1600000000001s)]
*  She is a commerce queen, and therefore she has said, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  I do not care where the Labooboos are coming from as long as I get them, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=531.1600000000001s)]
*  unless they're from Israel, in which case, no, thank you. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  But I will get it from the Mullahs. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=540.24s)]
*  I have a direct line with the Ayatollahs. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=544.24s)]
*  We are getting Labooboos from the Ayatollahs. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=547.24s)]
*  How do we end up being so isolated? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=549.24s)]
*  They banked so much for decades in the so-called proxy network, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=551.24s)]
*  the likes of Hezbollah, Hamas, the Hashd al-Shaabi in Iraq. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=555.24s)]
*  Look at those groups today. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=558.24s)]
*  Which of them are actually able to, even if they wanted to, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=560.24s)]
*  but are able to actually do anything good for Iraq? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=562.24s)]
*  QT is a 12-er Shia, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=565.32s)]
*  which is of course the closest Mormonism equivalent. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=570.32s)]
*  If we get ourselves out of this situation, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=577.32s)]
*  and hopefully we will soon, then the day after, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=580.32s)]
*  it's really prime time for Tehran to consider its overall regional upstream, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=583.32s)]
*  I think, because it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=590.32s)]
*  this is sort of the most obvious for me to say. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  You know who dislikes Iran's foreign policy in the region the most? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  I would argue the Iranian people. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  Why do you guys think QT is suspiciously absent when Nehruz happens? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=606.4000000000001s)]
*  But they find themselves in a position where they think that this war [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  could have been avoided, that this war could have been avoided [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=617.4000000000001s)]
*  if Iran had pursued a different regional approach. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=620.4000000000001s)]
*  And it didn't, and here we are dealing with the consequences. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=623.48s)]
*  She's too busy jumping over coals and fire. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=628.48s)]
*  Alex Vetankis, a fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=631.48s)]
*  thank you very much for your analysis there. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=634.48s)]
*  Let's go now to Bernard Smith in the Jordanian capital, Amman. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=636.48s)]
*  We are just seeing shots on our screen now of Tel Aviv. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=642.48s)]
*  Other areas of Israel have also been hit with missiles. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=645.48s)]
*  Haifa and Jerusalem. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  And we have seen missiles flying through the sky there in Tel Aviv. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=655.5600000000001s)]
*  We're going to speak with Bernard Smith, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  our correspondent in the Jordanian capital, Amman. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  Bernard? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes? Bernard, can you hear me? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  We just saw the end of one of the missiles [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=680.64s)]
*  sort of treading towards a southern bit of Israel, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=685.64s)]
*  passing over the top of Amman as they do sometimes, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=690.64s)]
*  although there was no alert over the city this time. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=693.64s)]
*  Again, this is similar to Saturday. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=697.64s)]
*  This is now very early hours of Monday morning here. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=700.64s)]
*  This is the end of the war. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=704.64s)]
*  This is sort of a similar pattern if you like to overnight, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=707.72s)]
*  Saturday into Sunday, in which there were two separate waves [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=712.72s)]
*  in the overnight hours. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=715.72s)]
*  What? I'm watching Tel Aviv now. Nothing's happening. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=717.72s)]
*  The video you're seeing, yes, other targets hit across [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=720.72s)]
*  other areas targeted across Israel. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=723.72s)]
*  The Israeli military said that they put out sirens [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=726.72s)]
*  from about 10 past four in the morning. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=731.72s)]

*  about sort of 10 minutes ago. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  The sirens responded to reports of ballistic missile impacts. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  The public was instructed to follow the instructions, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=749.8000000000001s)]

*  and share the locations and footage of any of the hits. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel says that about, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  Iran, five been fired by Iran to Israel. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=765.88s)]

*  before they hit Israeli territory or they, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=776.88s)]

*  just tell us what's the damage from the latest strikes going on. What are you hearing as [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1291.4s)]

*  Axios, the major US newspapers haven't picked it up yet, but the report is. Oh my God, dude, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1395.4s)]

*  to see Americans targeted. He said, if that happens, the US would get involved. But I [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1426.4s)]
*  think it's important to point out the difference between what we've seen as the response from [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1431.4s)]
*  president Donald Trump and broke president Joe Biden specific location over the skies. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1436.4s)]

*  near the IDF headquarters. Now, Elon Levy, I smell smoke. Well, I mean, we know he's [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1447.4s)]

*  on the AP live stream from Tel Aviv. You know what that means? Wait, it could just [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1458.4s)]
*  be because there's a lot of casualties and not necessarily like a very important person. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1463.4s)]
*  Military, but I think under the Biden administration, it would have been a much bigger deal that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1468.4s)]
*  people are actually dying and being injured and buildings are being hit in Israel. That [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1474.4s)]

*  dome. Watch it. It's annihilated by Iran. This is a couple of days ago. This is from [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1484.4s)]
*  the first day chat. Even though this is happening right now, this is why they don't want you [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1487.4s)]
*  to fucking post the scale back and forth, volume of bombs and weapons. When Donald Trump [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1491.4s)]
*  went to Marine one, because he's traveling to the G seven, the very first thing he talked [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1498.4s)]
*  about was not what's happening in Israel, not what's happening in happening in Iran. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1503.4s)]
*  He talked to, he wanted to complain about the meteorologists who forecasted rain during [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1509.4s)]
*  the parade, marking not only a 250th anniversary of the army, but it fell on his 79th birthday. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1515.4s)]
*  He said that the forecasters completely got it wrong. By the way, talked about how unlike [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1522.4s)]
*  with, unlike with Iran, a high profile assassination of like a head of state or something like [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1528.4s)]
*  Benjamin Danielle being assassinated would not change a damn thing in Israel's calculation. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1535.4s)]
*  For example, even with Vladimir Putin, there is no contingency. Okay. Like Vladimir Putin [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1541.4s)]
*  gets assassinated. Russia collapses. There is no real contingency behind him. I would [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1550.4s)]
*  say the same for like Iran. Iran is like a somewhat of a competent state, but I feel [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1557.4s)]
*  like a full tilt decapitation of all heads of state would probably disrupt Iran. It would [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1563.4s)]

*  we'll, we'll, I won't say how I feel about that, but there is plenty of fucking, there [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1581.4s)]
*  are plenty of just as bloodthirsty Israeli politicians that will take his place in a [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1588.4s)]
*  heartbeat and be just as brutal, just as ruthless, just as violent, which is precisely the reason [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1593.4s)]
*  why I get mad when people say, Oh, this is Netanyahu's war. You know what I mean? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1598.4s)]
*  That's crazy, dude. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1609.4s)]
*  Missiles that have been launched from Iran. And now we're seeing pictures from Haifa. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1612.4s)]
*  What are you seeing and hearing in Tel Aviv? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1617.4s)]
*  Good morning, Mohammed. Well, to be honest, I'm seeing the same thing that you are. It's [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1620.4s)]
*  not like I have just because just because I'm here, it doesn't mean I have a better [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1624.4s)]
*  viewpoint. Essentially what you're seeing on your television screens is what I'm seeing [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1629.4s)]
*  on my television screens. I'm in Tel Aviv. Wait, is this? There was a series of sirens [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1636.4s)]
*  in Tel Aviv and the general central Israel area that would, there were sirens. That looks [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1642.4s)]
*  like a, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. That looks like a precise strike. That [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1647.4s)]
*  that looks Israel style. Like when they go after one singular person, the image of all [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1654.4s)]
*  the planes is real is mostly refueling tankers, shadow tanker and recon Intel planes. Pegasus [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1661.4s)]
*  we're bombing Iran for sure. That picture of all the planes leaving the U S is real. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1667.4s)]
*  Four new tankers and a super cargo plane just took off in the last 10 minutes. I guess. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1671.4s)]
*  So what's up? Are we just going to war? Is that what that means? Five days until the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1675.4s)]
*  next aircraft carrier reaches the region, right? Ballistics push through interceptors. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1680.4s)]
*  Oh shit. What is this? And these motherfuckers in Tel Aviv, what these motherfuckers in Tel [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1688.4s)]
*  Aviv stopping at red lines. I'd be blown through those bitches if it was me for real. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1692.4s)]
*  What is why net saying a fire broke out in a building in the center, apparently from a [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1697.4s)]
*  direct hit star eating salt draft Dodgers. They're on knew the iron dome didn't work [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1702.4s)]
*  after that first attack a while back in response to Israel's drones. Yeah. This looks like [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1707.4s)]
*  an assassination and there are like, there were probably fucking people. I mean, I don't [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1711.4s)]
*  know. I don't see a high profile Israeli official being in a fucking apartment in the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1716.4s)]
*  eminence. Yeah. I miss a big bombing night like this. So who knows? That's like way too [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1723.4s)]
*  confident, you know? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1730.4s)]
*  High ranking Israeli official living on the fourth floor of a high rise. You never know. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1737.4s)]
*  With respect, which super important Israeli is living on the third floor of apartment? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1749.4s)]
*  I don't know. This room earlier, but look, it gets hit with an interceptor and still [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1755.4s)]
*  blows through it. Oh, wow. But yeah, there's a bunch of confirmed impacts, especially in [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1760.4s)]
*  Haifa. The refinery was hit. You know, Israeli jets fly 1600 kilometers to Iran. This is [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1772.4s)]
*  1600 kilometers and it's less if they carry a heavy payload. And in order to sustain an [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1782.4s)]
*  ongoing operation, you need jets in the air and to take air defenses and to bomb targets. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1789.4s)]
*  If you've noticed until now, Israel conspicuously refrained from attacking Iranian military [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1796.4s)]
*  targets. I mean, yes, some were hit, but it's not part of the campaign. The Iranian Navy, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1802.4s)]
*  Iranian airfields, Iranian military bases. This was more targeted toward the nuclear [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1808.4s)]
*  facilities and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps installations. However, the IRS [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1816.4s)]
*  has an Asian attempt on our way in confirmation of success. They said the target was in [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1826.4s)]
*  Gush Don. I don't see that happening unless the Iranians make some gross mistake or miscalculation [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1829.4s)]
*  and attack either some Arab Gulf states or... I mean, what if it's Caitlyn Jenner? No, Iran, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1836.4s)]
*  Iran is pro-trans based on what we know now. They wouldn't do that. Iran would not do that. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1842.4s)]
*  They're pro-trans. All right, Alam Pinkus. Thanks for joining us so much on Al Jazeera. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1850.4s)]
*  We'll be coming back to you in the next hour. We appreciate it. Another POV or the Haifa [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1856.4s)]
*  hit from the apartment. Footage showing that he's a columnist at the Haaretz. Let's see. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1859.4s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1865.4s)]
*  God damn. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1889.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1895.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1901.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1925.4s)]
*  Oh, this is sick. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1928.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1934.4s)]
*  Those are big-ass missiles with small-ass blast radius. The fuck? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1950.4s)]
*  Can you feel it? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1955.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1958.4s)]
*  We saw this one already. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1964.4s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1966.4s)]
*  There's one that just... boom. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1970.4s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1973.4s)]
*  ...life project. I guess that it's a mixture of consideration. I cannot get into his heart or into his mind, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1976.4s)]
*  but I give him the credit that he believes that what he is doing now is the right thing to do in historical terms. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1985.4s)]
*  I'm sure he convinced he's convinced. Time will show if this is true. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1993.4s)]
*  Yes, changing the regime of Tehran is obviously a hidden goal. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=1999.4s)]
*  Life-transferring 2.3 million people from Gaza is a hidden goal in Israel. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2008.4s)]
*  But even if nobody will admit it, everything will be done to get to it, and both are unachievable, I'm afraid, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2014.4s)]
*  or I'm happy, but in any case, both are unachievable. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2023.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, he went to this campaign, as usual, with a lot of success in the beginning, as usual, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2027.4s)]
*  with a lot of support almost one-to-one in Israel, and as usual, very soon it might turn into a fiasco. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2035.4s)]
*  We don't know yet. But I just wrote yesterday, excuse me for quoting myself, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2043.4s)]
*  that trumpets are too early because we don't know how it will end. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2049.4s)]
*  As usual, you know in those campaigns how do you start, you don't know how do you end. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2053.4s)]
*  It might end, it might be the most isolated avalanche. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2059.4s)]
*  Gideon, we are seeing these live pictures now out of Haifa. People have come out of some of the buildings. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2067.4s)]
*  We clearly see that there is damage that has been done in Haifa from this latest [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2073.4s)]
*  latest irage of missiles from Iran towards Israel. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2077.4s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could tell our viewers about the impact that all of this is having on Israeli citizens [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2081.4s)]
*  and what the thinking is there when it comes to how protected they may be when it comes to the government [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2087.4s)]
*  and what the government is doing. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2095.4s)]
*  The first of all, part of Israelis are very, very well protected. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2097.4s)]
*  First of all, the alarm system is extremely functioning this time. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2103.4s)]
*  We get alarms much before the siren. We can prepare ourselves. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2109.4s)]
*  In Tel Aviv, there are, as we see in most parts of Tel Aviv for example, there are quite many shelters. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2115.4s)]
*  All the new buildings have their own shelters and safe rooms. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2123.4s)]
*  So from this point of view you have the feeling that the population is protected, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2127.4s)]
*  which is not true for huge other populations in Israel. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2131.4s)]
*  For example, the Israeli Palestinians, the Bedouins, they don't have one single shelter all over Israel. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2135.4s)]
*  I intend to go today to the village of Tamra where a whole family was killed because they don't have any shelter [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2141.4s)]
*  in a city of 35,000 people, not one single shelter. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2149.4s)]
*  When a next by Jewish village of 1,000 inhabitants has served. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2154.4s)]
*  So you understand that even this is not on very just an equal light. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2162.4s)]
*  You asked about the sentiment. I think that the more nights like this will take place, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2169.4s)]
*  Israelis will start to not only be tired and frightened, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2177.4s)]
*  but then they will finally start to ask, is it worth it and where are we heading to? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2182.4s)]
*  From war to war, from bombarding to bombarding. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2188.4s)]
*  Because this time, unlikely Gaza, unlikely Lebanon, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2192.4s)]
*  the price of the civilian population might be much heavier than ever. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2198.4s)]
*  So Israel can take it for a few days. It cannot take it for a long period of time. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2203.4s)]
*  Gideon, it seems we're hearing sirens again now, air raid sirens again in Israel. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2208.4s)]
*  I want to ask you if you're hearing them as well, but also I want to ask you about from your perspective, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2215.4s)]
*  what might be an attainable political endgame for Israel in this conflict? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2223.4s)]
*  I mean, are there any realistic conditions under which Israel would consider his operations against Iran complete or successful? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2228.4s)]
*  The person for interning the new sirens right now and no warnings. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2235.4s)]
*  And this question about the endgame must be first of all, direct to the prime minister. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2241.4s)]
*  And why they're bombing again. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2248.4s)]
*  He knows I know what I think. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2250.4s)]
*  I think, I think after tonight, Israel's going to do the big bad. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2253.4s)]
*  And I think Iran knows Israel's about to do the big bad. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2258.4s)]
*  That's why this is their like big push. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2262.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2273.4s)]
*  Big bad is like decapitation. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2283.4s)]
*  In other words, not the N word, man. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2286.4s)]
*  No, that's the biggest bad. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2289.4s)]
*  No, I think Israel is going to do decapitation potentially. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2292.4s)]
*  And America is moving. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2299.4s)]
*  And I think America is moving into the region afterwards. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2304.4s)]
*  Like I think [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2307.4s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2318.4s)]
*  There's still Iranians in the champion like Iranians are not supporting this war. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2319.4s)]
*  This is nothing related to Iranians. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2322.4s)]
*  Islamic regime put people in the situation. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2323.4s)]
*  Okay, brother, you know, write that on a note. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2325.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2330.4s)]
*  And maybe when they, when they pulled your fucking body out of a rubble, when a GBU 59 [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2331.4s)]
*  rocket goes into your fucking living room, they'll go, Oh man, well, this one actually [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2336.4s)]
*  didn't like the Iranian regime. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2341.4s)]
*  Do you think Israel gives a fuck about your opinion about the, the, the domestic plight [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2343.4s)]
*  that you're going through? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2350.4s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2351.4s)]
*  They don't give a shit of you. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2352.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2353.4s)]
*  Very clearly. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2354.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2355.4s)]
*  I mean, there's no way that dude is actually in fucking Iran. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2356.4s)]
*  Israel struck Iran first. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2359.4s)]
*  There's no way that dude is literally in Iran because if he was in Iran, I think he'd have [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2361.4s)]
*  a fucking very different perspective. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2365.4s)]
*  All right, Gideon Levy joining us live from Tel Aviv Gideon. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2370.4s)]
*  Thanks so much for your analysis. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2373.4s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2374.4s)]
*  Let's go now to Bernard. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2375.4s)]
*  So killing the generals that were killing normal people when people were producing. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2376.4s)]
*  You're so fucking stupid. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2379.4s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could bring our viewers up to date on what you are seeing and hearing. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2380.4s)]
*  Israel has killed 224 people so far in Tehran as a first strike. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2384.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2388.4s)]
*  Since the first Israel struck Tehran the first day. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2389.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2393.4s)]
*  Israel struck Tehran the first day. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2394.4s)]
*  Since then they've killed 224 Iranians. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2396.4s)]
*  90% of them are civilians. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2398.4s)]
*  90%. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2400.4s)]
*  They've been taken out fucking entire residential buildings. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2401.4s)]
*  They're doing car bombings. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2405.4s)]
*  Was it 224 generals? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2407.4s)]
*  Does Iran have 224 generals? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2408.4s)]
*  Does Iran operate with the same fucking with the same exact rank inflation that Israel [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2410.4s)]
*  operates with? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2416.4s)]
*  This is the Tel Aviv damage. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2417.4s)]
*  No, this is not what we're looking for. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2418.4s)]
*  I'm telling you there there's a fucking massive cloud of smoke and that is not from this. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2420.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2427.4s)]
*  There ain't no way I'd be shocked if it was just like a residential building. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2428.4s)]
*  What is the decapitation? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2432.4s)]
*  The decapitation is that when they assassinate heads of state Israeli informants. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2435.4s)]
*  Israeli infrastructure targets as the Israelis have been targeting Iranian infrastructure [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2439.4s)]
*  targets. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2446.4s)]
*  And there have also been reports. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2447.4s)]
*  You can't choose how many people are die from a missile dumbass. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2449.4s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2452.4s)]
*  And while missiles have also been seen. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2453.4s)]
*  Are you telling me that Jerusalem inevitably ordinarily most of what Israel what is fired [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2454.4s)]
*  at Israel seems to get intercepted and destroyed by Iron Dome or the Israeli Air Force before [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2460.4s)]
*  they hit the ground. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2467.4s)]
*  But there is shrapnel. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2468.4s)]
*  There is debris and clearly one or two missiles. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2469.4s)]
*  Some missiles are getting through. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2472.4s)]
*  Yeah, Bernard, I wanted to ask you about that because obviously we are in this situation [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2474.4s)]
*  now where there is this tit for tat that's going on. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2478.4s)]
*  Iran firing Israel firing on Iran Iran firing on Israel. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2481.4s)]
*  You're talking about the missiles that have come from Iran that have been able to breach [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2485.4s)]
*  the Iron Dome air defense system in Israel and land in Israel. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2489.4s)]
*  What's the extent of what we know about, you know, perhaps how many of those missiles have [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2493.4s)]
*  been intercepted? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2498.4s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2499.4s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2500.4s)]
*  How many have gotten through? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2501.4s)]
*  Well, estimates before this latest wave of missiles where there were 200 or so missiles [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2502.4s)]
*  that Iran had ran at five trains. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2510.4s)]
*  Very difficult scene. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2513.4s)]
*  Just talk to a man who's bleeding multiple buildings damaged or destroyed from a direct [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2514.4s)]
*  hit central Israel. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2517.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2518.4s)]
*  So it wasn't actually the idea of headquarters. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2519.4s)]
*  To be fair, you said in one breath, Israel's known for precision and then they want to [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2521.4s)]
*  kill everyone in the next. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2524.4s)]
*  Israel has precise targeting capabilities. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2525.4s)]
*  They've demonstrated that in Tehran. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2528.4s)]
*  They've demonstrated that in Gaza is their precise targeting capabilities implies that [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2529.4s)]
*  they're not interested in doing a targeted assassination. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2534.4s)]
*  They shouldn't do a targeted assassination. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2538.4s)]
*  Anyway, you can be precise if you want to be and then choose not to and be imprecise. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2540.4s)]
*  That's usually what Israel fucking does. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2546.4s)]
*  Extensive damage to several buildings. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2549.4s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2551.4s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2555.4s)]
*  The conflict in Gaza is clouded your judgment on Iran. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2559.4s)]
*  The Iranian people don't want the current regime. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2562.4s)]
*  Dude, it has not clouded my judgment on Iran at all. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2564.4s)]
*  I know that there's fuck a shit ton of people in Iran that don't want the current regime. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2567.4s)]
*  That is an entirely different sentence. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2571.4s)]
*  One that I say all the fucking time. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2573.4s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2576.4s)]
*  There's never been a moment where I said, Oh, everybody loves the fucking Ayatollah. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2577.4s)]
*  I don't think that I don't believe that I've never said that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2581.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2584.4s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I've talked about the glaringly obvious national security issue [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2585.4s)]
*  that the fucking Ayatollah and its repressive policies have created paired up with the obvious [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2590.4s)]
*  economic strangulation of Iranian society due to the sanctions. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2597.4s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2601.4s)]
*  Ultimately, it doesn't matter because Ayatollah is not dropping a fucking bomb on them. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2603.4s)]
*  Right now, Israel is. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2606.4s)]
*  How do you not understand that? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2607.4s)]
*  Where do you? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2609.4s)]
*  Why do you think people resent the fundamentalist Iranian government? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2610.4s)]
*  They resent it because there's suppression. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2614.4s)]
*  There's a lot of repression. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2617.4s)]
*  There's a lot of suppression. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2619.4s)]
*  People get fucking killed when they're protesting their government. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2620.4s)]
*  It's death, right? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2623.4s)]
*  All of a sudden, all of a sudden now there is a different group, an outside group that [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2624.4s)]
*  is killing people and there's no control over that. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2630.4s)]
*  It's completely outside of your fucking hands. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2633.4s)]
*  All of a sudden, you're going to hate that group more. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2635.4s)]
*  That's simply it. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2637.4s)]
*  It's not like and under different circumstances, you could be like, well, the Iranian government [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2638.4s)]
*  has played fast and loose. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2644.4s)]
*  They've really, they really pushed Israel to do this. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2645.4s)]
*  They already struck Israel first or something like that. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2648.4s)]
*  You can't say that in this circumstance because this happened amidst a denuclearization agreement. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2650.4s)]
*  Iran has been tremendously restrained since October 7th. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2656.4s)]
*  So restrained, restrained to a fucking foot. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2659.4s)]
*  Restraint to a fucking fault. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2662.4s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2663.4s)]
*  So you think that people can't fucking see that? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2664.4s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2666.4s)]
*  These smooth brain chatters would never say people hate Trump and therefore they're happy [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2667.4s)]
*  to see missiles flying into America, killing people from all over from Canada and we will [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2670.4s)]
*  greet them as liberators. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2673.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2674.4s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2675.4s)]
*  There's a lot of people who get their nose in the Iranian diaspora. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2676.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2679.4s)]
*  And think, oh, well, the Iranians that I know, they say it's good that they're blowing up [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2680.4s)]
*  is they're blowing up Iran. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2687.4s)]
*  It's fucking idiotic. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2689.4s)]
*  No one thinks it's good to fucking kill children. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2690.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2693.4s)]
*  Unless you're Israel and you're talking about Gaza, in which case you think it's the best, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2694.4s)]
*  the maximum good earlier in the evening with regard to the sentiment in Israel on the one [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2698.4s)]

*  in Israel is actually doing enough. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2712.4s)]
*  Like, do you think the Israeli society was celebrated? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2714.4s)]
*  If Benjamin Netanyahu was assassinated, I'm sure there's plenty of people who don't like [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2716.4s)]
*  them. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2719.4s)]
*  No, they wouldn't. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2720.4s)]
*  They wouldn't fucking celebrate it at all. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2721.4s)]
*  Stupid Israelis are known for rallying around the flag in times of crisis. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2722.4s)]
*  And certainly when it comes to going to war with Iran, war in Iran has been spoken about [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2728.4s)]
*  repeatedly for going on 30 years, perhaps even more. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2733.4s)]
*  Iran is generally considered by the great majority of Israelis to be Israel's number [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2737.4s)]
*  one enemy. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2742.4s)]
*  Like there is more. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2744.4s)]
*  There is like the Israeli chatters in here. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2746.4s)]
*  Correctly blaming Israel for starting this tit for tat back and forth, which is not even [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2750.4s)]
*  tit for tat really makes more sense than Iranian chatters being like, well, you know, Iran [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2756.4s)]
*  really did start this is like, no, they didn't. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2761.4s)]
*  Israel literally started it. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2764.4s)]
*  Israel decided to open fire and blow up Tehran. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2766.4s)]
*  They wanted to be somewhat in-hawk to the settlers and the more parts of his government. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2771.4s)]
*  But he's also generally thought to be quite busy with getting himself out of his own personal [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2778.4s)]
*  legal troubles. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2784.4s)]
*  And the level of mistrust with regard to his government has brought most Israelis, again, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2786.4s)]
*  not to denounce him, but to shift into a kind of a personal survival mode. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2790.4s)]
*  There are still long lines stretching before many Israeli stores that sell everything from [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2795.4s)]
*  food to medicine. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2800.4s)]
*  Israelis believe they need to take care of themselves at the moment. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2801.4s)]
*  They have very few expectations of the government to take care of them. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2804.4s)]
*  Or is there a sense in Israel that there is any kind of actual endgame when it comes to [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2807.4s)]
*  this conflict or that there is an attainable endgame? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2814.4s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2817.4s)]
*  The number of tankers in Israel. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2818.4s)]
*  Are there any now at 21 or is there the perception that there are any realistic conditions under [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2820.4s)]
*  which Israel would consider operations against Iran to be complete in the days or weeks ahead? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2826.4s)]
*  That is the $64,000 question. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2833.4s)]
*  And it is very much reminiscent of the situation in Gaza after October 7, 2023. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2836.4s)]
*  There is no visible endgame. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2842.4s)]
*  Various potential demonstrations of victory or proofs of triumph have been spoken of. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2845.4s)]
*  There is a Israel's public broadcast. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2852.4s)]
*  They're calling reporting casuals from the latest Iranian missile strikes. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2855.4s)]
*  Though no further details have yet been released just yet. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2857.4s)]
*  The Israeli minister also said it detected launches from Yemen. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2859.4s)]
*  Who these spokesperson yesterday announced that their force were coordinating their launches with Iran. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2861.4s)]

*  You think he has a say in this again? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2912.4s)]
*  It's the same principle. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2915.4s)]
*  It's the same principle behind every fucking every government in the region. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2917.4s)]
*  He this one is Mr. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2922.4s)]

*  It's wild. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2932.4s)]
*  Like one must ask the question why so many people suspiciously in all of the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2933.4s)]
*  neighboring countries have this kind of attitude, perhaps all deeply anti-Semitic. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2939.4s)]
*  I know. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2946.4s)]
*  I know that like Israel thinks, oh no, they're all disgusting Arab monsters who are, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2947.4s)]
*  you know, deeply, deeply anti-Semitic and they're all Hamas. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2953.4s)]
*  But don't you think this invites a little bit of self-reflection? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2957.4s)]
*  Do you feel as though, do you feel as though these guys are just anti-democracy [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2962.4s)]
*  enjoyers? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2966.4s)]
*  They hate the most moral nation because they're immoral. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2967.4s)]
*  Do you think they hate the only democracy in the region because they're undemocratic? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2970.4s)]
*  Do you think it's because I mean, this is Lebanon. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2974.4s)]
*  So what I'm about to say is even funnier. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2977.4s)]
*  Do you think it's because Israel is gay or perhaps it's some other reason? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2979.4s)]
*  I just can't think of it. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2983.4s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2985.4s)]
*  That's only a couple of months ago. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2986.4s)]
*  Israel was doing this to them for no fucking reason. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2987.4s)]
*  What else should they be doing? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2990.4s)]
*  How do you know this is not nitpick from a bunch of videos? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2991.4s)]
*  Wait, what do you think? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2994.4s)]
*  I'm actually fucking railing against them. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2996.4s)]
*  Are you stupid? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2998.4s)]
*  I'm saying, I understand the sentiment coming from a lot of the surrounding countries and [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=2999.4s)]
*  the populations and said surrounding countries. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3006.4s)]
*  Just like I understand why fucking the Palestinians to reach, make jokes and celebrate this. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3008.4s)]
*  Generally, there's some confusion. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3019.4s)]
*  It's a very elaborate system. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3021.4s)]
*  When asked about this confusion today, the IDF said these are all recommendations we [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3023.4s)]
*  never officially committed to telling people exactly what to do. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3029.4s)]
*  That to me, as a well-known consumer of Israeli public utilities, says that confusion is beginning [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3033.4s)]
*  to seep in at the institutional level as well, not just at the ordinary citizen level. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3040.4s)]
*  Ori, I want to switch gears a little bit and just ask you about the G7 summit. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3046.4s)]
*  The reason I want to ask you about that is because several hours ago we heard the Israeli [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3051.4s)]
*  president, either Herzog, he was calling for G7 countries to be involved in its war against [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3055.4s)]
*  Iran. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3060.4s)]
*  Do you think that there are any signs that any of the participants that's going to happen, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3061.4s)]
*  by the way, I think it's going to happen. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3065.4s)]
*  I'm just saying it. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3066.4s)]
*  I'm saying it again from Iranian liberal academic Sadiq Ziba column who was imprisoned by the [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3067.4s)]
*  Islamic Republic in 2018. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3074.4s)]
*  I am truly amazed by the expectations of Netanyahu Trump or Prince Reza Pahlavi who want me to [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3075.4s)]
*  support Israel and stand up against the regime under these circumstances, which opposition [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3080.4s)]
*  figure has spoken and written as much as I have against this regime. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3084.4s)]
*  But how can I join the enemy in this situation? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3087.4s)]
*  Was it right for the M.E.K. to join Saddam? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3089.4s)]
*  Do you think Canada will get involved too if the U.S. does? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3093.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3095.4s)]

*  anti-regime change friends just posted this on their story. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3101.4s)]

*  Wait, hold on. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3108.4s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g977Oyd9Qc&t=3109.4s)]
