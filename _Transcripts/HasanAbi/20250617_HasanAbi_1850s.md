# WW3 Is Getting Very Close | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0)
*  You see that is so strange. You rarely ever hear someone on you rarely ever see someone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=0.0s)]
*  as a global affairs analyst come on and be like, Hey, maybe we shouldn't go to thing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=8.16s)]
*  more with Iran. That seems kind of doesn't that strike you as odd? I've yet to hear from [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=12.32s)]
*  one professional analyst that they have on that says, This seems like a decision. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=18.36s)]
*  In other news, President Trump is cutting his G seven trip short as Israel and Iran [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=24.84s)]
*  are trading these devastating strikes. Mark Meredith joins us live now with more Mark. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=35.68s)]
*  Ainsley, good morning to you. President Trump is back at the White House after cutting his [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=40.68s)]
*  The president making it very clear. He does not believe in any uncertain terms that Iran [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=46.12s)]
*  should have any nuclear weapon capabilities. But the president was also asked on Air Force [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=50.12s)]
*  one on his way back to D. C. Why he decided he needed to come back to D. C. So quickly, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  listen to what he had to say. We're not looking for a ceasefire. I didn't say I was looking for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=58.92s)]
*  a cease. We're looking for better. Remember, we're ran cannot have a nuclear weapons. Very [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=63.72s)]
*  simple not to go too deep into it. They just can't have a new weapon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=69.56s)]
*  Thinking on the call for two round to evacuate. Is there a threat or is there incoming? What [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=75.12s)]
*  was the thing? I want people to be safe. Now, the president was in Canada meeting with many [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=80.56s)]
*  world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron. And while he was there, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=86.64s)]
*  the president signed on to an agreement calling for peace in the Middle East. But also it was [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  critical of some comments that Macron made. Macron was suggesting that the reason that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  Trump was heading back to the U. S. Was to create a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=98.56s)]
*  Trump put out on true social publicity seeking. Trump is live. Is he? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=102.88s)]
*  Crone of France mistakenly said that I left the G seven to go back to D. C. To work on it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=108.24s)]
*  Ron wrong. He has no idea why I'm on my way to D. C. But it certainly has nothing to do with the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=112.88s)]
*  ceasefire. Much bigger than that, whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay tuned. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=118.16s)]
*  We'll be looking to see if French President has any new reaction while he is still in Canada. But [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  the president, he is back here in D. C. Meeting with his national security team. We don't have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=128.64s)]
*  an updated schedule yet, guys, so we don't know if we'll see the president address the situation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=132.72s)]
*  on camera later today. But of course, there are so many developments happening in real time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=136.64s)]
*  And Brian Lawrence, it's not the Israeli Iran conflict. I get it. But the president is on a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  fast track to get a trade deal. Looks like with Canada, he had formally signed the one with the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  UK. And I personally think that he was not thrilled about the Ukrainian talks. So Ron [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=150.32s)]
*  Harris, I know Brad Lander has been really shut up. He probably knows he's going to get pressure to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  hit Russia with sanctions. I don't think he was really looking forward to that session. Do you [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  think that played into it, Mark? Well, Brian, that Macron and Trump have certainly had interesting [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=165.68s)]
*  relationships over the last year. Trump last year praised him as a pretty smart guy. But obviously [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=169.84s)]
*  we've seen the back and forth that Macron has had. He's been very vocal on it comes to the Ukraine [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=174.24s)]
*  issue. And Macron obviously wanting to keep Europe and the U. S. Involved with Ukraine. However, I [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  would imagine it was so much of the focus over the president's going to be on what happens next [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=183.92s)]
*  with whether or not Israel goes forward with an even larger attack against Tehran. Trump was asked [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=188.0s)]
*  about that on the plane, whether why he said the people of Tehran should evacuate. He didn't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=192.16s)]
*  elaborate further, but obviously people are reading between the lines that a possibility of a major [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  attack is still on the table. Hi, Mark. Thanks so much. Do you know if they made up at all the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  Macron's? I mean, that little incident, the plane, the president and his wife. Could you follow up? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=206.0s)]
*  President Trump left the G seven summit in Canada one day early to keep track of the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  fighting in the Middle East. As the president returned to Washington, he told reporters [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=216.56s)]
*  that he wants Iran to give up any thoughts of developing a nuclear weapon. Nancy Cordes is in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=221.12s)]
*  Calgary covering the summit of Western leaders that will continue today without Trump. Nancy, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=226.4s)]
*  good morning. Good morning, Nate. That's right. The G seven summit will have to do with just six [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=231.52s)]
*  leaders here in Canada today. After president Trump's abrupt departure last night overnight, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=236.24s)]
*  aboard Air Force one flying home, he told reporters that he plans to spend the day in the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=242.08s)]
*  situation room and that his new goal is for Iran to shutter its nuclear facilities entirely unless [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=246.88s)]
*  Israel destroys them first. We're looking at it better than we're looking at versus flying home [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=254.08s)]
*  from Canada early this morning. President Trump said he had to get back to monitor Israel's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=260.32s)]
*  bombardment of Iran, which he suggested could intensify over the next few days. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=265.28s)]
*  This was supposed to be a two day meeting of the minds for the leaders of the world's largest [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  democracies. But towards the end of day one, Trump's press secretary posted this. President [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=278.88s)]
*  Trump had a great day at the G seven and much was accomplished. But because of what's going [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=285.44s)]
*  on in the Middle East, he will [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=290.72s)]
*  before departing. Trump posted this ominous message urging everyone to evacuate Tehran. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  White House officials say the U. S. Has no plans to join the fight, though refueling jets and a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=314.48s)]
*  second carrier strike group are moving closer to the region just in case Iran tries to strike [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=320.08s)]
*  U. S bases. President Trump said this morning that he has not reached out to Iran to initiate [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=325.52s)]
*  peace talks. He said they should have taken the deal that was on the table because they are now [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=343.52s)]
*  losing this conflict badly here in Canada. The summit goes on with Canadian officials [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=348.64s)]
*  telling CBS News that they were giving given a heads up that President Trump was planning [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=354.64s)]
*  to depart early before the news was made public. Nate, Nancy, thank you. There is new CNN reporting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=359.76s)]
*  indicate there are doubts in the intelligence community about how close Iran actually is [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=366.4s)]
*  to getting a weapon. CNN's Zach Cohen has this reporting is with us now. What are you learning, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=371.76s)]
*  Zach? There appears to be some daylight between the U. S. Intelligence community and Israel and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=375.76s)]
*  Donald Trump on this question of how close Iran is to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Specifically, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=382.08s)]
*  sources telling me and our colleague Katie Bo Lilis that the intelligence community assessed [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  before the most recent Israeli strikes that Iran was years away, as much as three years away from [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=392.0s)]
*  not only obtaining a nuclear weapon but developing the system meant to deliver it at a target of its [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=397.92s)]
*  choosing. That does really run counter to the more urgent and dire timeline that Israel and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=402.56s)]
*  Donald Trump have put forward. In recent days, Israel of course saying and Israeli Prime Minister [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=408.88s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Iran has been working in secret to develop nuclear weapons over [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=414.24s)]
*  the last several months and that it's very close to having a nuclear weapon. Donald Trump of course [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=419.92s)]
*  addressing this question today when he was asked by reporters about his director of national [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=425.28s)]
*  intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard's testimony in March where she said that Iran is not actively [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=429.44s)]
*  working towards a nuclear weapon. Take a listen to what Donald Trump said when he was asked this [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=433.68s)]
*  question today. You've always said that you don't believe Iran should be able to have a nuclear [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=437.36s)]
*  weapon but how close do you personally think that they are to getting one because Tulsi Gabbard [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=441.12s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said Iran wasn't building [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=446.4s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. Okay what she said I think we're close enough. So why does this matter, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=451.04s)]
*  Israel has used this sort of urgent warning about Iran's nuclear program as justification for [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=455.76s)]
*  its latest round of preemptive strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Of course this big question [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=460.8s)]
*  still hangs over the entire situation as to whether or not Donald Trump in the U.S. will become [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=465.92s)]
*  directly involved in the conflict. Donald Trump has said as recently as today that he wants to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=470.56s)]
*  dismantle Iran's nuclear program. In order to do so that will require one of two things experts tell [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=474.88s)]
*  us either a negotiated deal or U.S. military strikes. All right Zach Cohen some brand new [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=479.52s)]
*  reporting this story is right now appreciate your work on this thank you very much. With us now is [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=484.4s)]
*  CNN global affairs analyst Brett McGurk he's a former White House coordinator for the Middle [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=489.44s)]
*  East and North Africa who's been deeply involved in discussions in and around Iran for many many [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=493.67999999999995s)]
*  years and thank God we got a true diversity of opinion once again. Biden's very own [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  Middle East envoy here responsible for one of the most responsible figures for Israel's genocide [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=507.12s)]
*  under the Biden leadership. Brett what I want to focus on is President Trump headed to the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  Situation Room this morning and much of the discussion might be focused around one site [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=518.0s)]
*  in particular one nuclear site I just want to put it on the map here so people can see [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=523.84s)]
*  it's the Fordo nuclear enrichment site we can push in a little bit to get people a sense of what it [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=528.1600000000001s)]
*  looks like the area looks like. Why is this site so important? Well John I think the President [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=533.44s)]
*  should be in the Situation Room today it's the Situation Room was actually created by JFK after [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=539.76s)]
*  the Bay of Pigs fiasco for a situation like this to provide full spectrum awareness for a President [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=544.4s)]
*  as he makes it has to make critical decisions and there are three immediate priorities and one of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=550.0s)]
*  them is what you just mentioned but number one are the protection of Americans in the region [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=554.48s)]
*  and the protection of Israel we have to surge the missile interceptors into Israel we're doing that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=558.56s)]
*  as as dude sick sick dude so much diversity of opinion do you see that it's so strange [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=563.76s)]
*  you rarely ever hear someone on you rarely ever see someone as a global affairs analyst come on [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=572.4s)]
*  and be like hey maybe we shouldn't go to war with Iran that seems kind of doesn't that strike you [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=578.4s)]
*  as odd I've yet to hear from one professional analyst that they have on that says this seems [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=583.68s)]
*  like a stupid decision as Nick just said a very small number of missiles yesterday it looks like [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=591.6s)]
*  about 10 can't draw a conclusion yet but the Israelis are taking out not only the missiles [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=597.52s)]
*  but the launchers very important second you want to contain this conflict to Israel and Iran not [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=602.0s)]
*  have regional spread so far that objective is being met and I think the signals of the administrations [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=607.2s)]
*  putting out are very good third and this gets to your point you want to keep particularly the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  Israelis focused on the stated objectives of this military campaign the stated objectives are [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=617.68s)]
*  dismantling the nuclear program and the missile program that's it you want to avoid mission creep [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=624.0s)]
*  now on the on the nuclear program there are three main sites two enrichment sites one at Natanz [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=630.4s)]
*  much of which is above ground some below ground the Israelis appear to have very effectively [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=636.4799999999999s)]

*  with iran's nuclear program dismantled and fordo really is the key it can be a deal that we can all [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=838.64s)]
*  hope for a deal or it can be a military operation again this is another look at fordo right here you [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=844.9599999999999s)]
*  can see this area right here is where the centrifuges are believed to be buried deep inside [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=850.2399999999999s)]
*  the mountain here and what brett was just talking about is it's believed that the only way to destroy [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=855.76s)]
*  this is through a u.s weapon the b2 bombers dropping what's called this this bunker buster [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=861.52s)]
*  bomb the gbu 57 here how what do you think that discussion is like brett about whether or not the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=867.28s)]
*  u.s should get involved here benjamin daniel who was all but explicitly said hey come on drop this [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=875.3599999999999s)]
*  bomb i have to say the u.s military has trained on this for over a decade this munition was kind [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=881.04s)]
*  of designed for this purpose now look there have been massive risks about such an operation like [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=887.5999999999999s)]
*  this number one risk used to be hesbola hesbola had 150 000 to 200 000 missiles and rockets [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  aiming at israel hesbola has been knocked on his back number two has been iranian air defenses [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=898.3199999999999s)]
*  they russian air defense systems very high risk of taking down airplanes those are no longer there [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=903.28s)]
*  so those risks have basically been eliminated iran can certainly respond i would never downplay [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=908.32s)]
*  the risks of any military operation but i would just say this is a very feasible option iran knows [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  it it's important they know it for the purpose of trying to get a diplomatic resolution to this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=918.88s)]
*  problem and the problem of fordo i think that right now is the main objective but it takes [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=924.88s)]
*  the military pressure to get iran to the table and to do that deal this is really going to unfold [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=929.36s)]
*  here over the next three to four days i think it's a it's a very critical period i'm watching [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=934.24s)]
*  today can iran again muster another missile barrage or are they really now depleted and brett you use [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=938.16s)]
*  the term coercive diplomacy that's what's happening here what is that exactly well coercive diplomacy [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=944.88s)]
*  is what uh you know this administration past administrations have used fairly effectively [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  with the iranians number one coercive diplomacy means using the negotiations process [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=956.56s)]
*  as build ambition basically is here i'll give you an example it's not even the denuclearization [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=963.76s)]
*  right off it's fine it's cutting in and out but it's fine calm down it's okay we're back i'll give [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=968.96s)]
*  you a very simplified example of a coercive diplomacy someone robbing you at gunpoint [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=975.12s)]
*  someone comes up to you with a gun and says give me your wallet and your phone you say no they shoot [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=980.72s)]
*  you in the foot they repeat give me your wallet or your and your phone or else i'll shoot you in the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=988.72s)]
*  head and if you don't give him your wallet and your phone they kill you and take your wallet and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=995.04s)]
*  phone anyway that is what he means that's it that's all this is that's not diplomacy that's a robbery [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  that doesn't make any sense to claim this is diplomacy is psychotic [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SMcZQJce0&t=1008.16s)]
