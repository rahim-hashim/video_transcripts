# Trump Meets With Indian Prime Minister Modi | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s)
*  India is not at all involved in Ukraine is a crazy thing to say, considering that anytime [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=0.0s)]
*  there is India becomes a secondary market to, to, to, you know, basically continue trade [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=7.7s)]
*  with the, the recipients of said sessions. So no, they play a very formative role. Security [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=16.52s)]
*  cooperation with Ukraine, where I don't know if it'll be like mercenaries or private contractors [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=28.74s)]
*  or something. And he will extract, he will extract as much natural resources out of Ukraine [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=34.3s)]
*  as possible in the process, which I think corresponds to the American agenda, the foreign [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=40.099999999999994s)]
*  policy agenda across the board in Ukraine, no matter who's in charge. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  One plus one 11 and not two. And this is the power of 11 that is going to work for the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=51.66s)]
*  welfare of the human. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=56.54s)]
*  What the f**k? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=57.54s)]
*  I once again thank my friend, President Trump, and we together resolve that we will together [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=58.54s)]
*  march towards progress and prosperity for our nations. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=78.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=79.5s)]
*  Thank you very much. He's doing a great job in India. Everybody talks about it. He's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=80.5s)]
*  doing a really fantastic job. A great leader. Great leader. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=86.22s)]
*  Of course he loves Modi. Remember, foreign policy, you and a party. It's not like the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=92.42s)]
*  Democrats were anti Modi either. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=97.06s)]
*  I thank you for your voice, Mr. President. And I firmly believe that every person in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=105.1s)]
*  India respects your sentiments. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=108.74s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=109.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=110.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=111.74s)]
*  Any questions? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=112.74s)]
*  You are both very popular leaders in your respective countries. You've spoken about [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=114.1s)]
*  a common sense diplomatic doctrine. So what's a Trump-Modi doctrine that you should expect [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=119.1s)]
*  from the media? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=124.1s)]
*  Trump doesn't know India is a part of BRICS. Trump thinks Spain is a part of BRICS. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=125.1s)]
*  The thing else will be the unity. We have great unity. We have great friendship. He [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=130.1s)]
*  and I and our countries. And I think it's only going to get closer, but it's very important [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=134.1s)]
*  that we remain united as countries. We are friends and we're going to stay that way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=140.1s)]
*  I don't like that we're watching this in real time and not watching the so Saudi version [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=145.1s)]
*  of events that will inevitably be shown, which is probably going to be the real truth of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=151.26s)]
*  the matter. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=158.94s)]
*  We've done a fantastic job for the American people. We had a great four years and we were [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=159.94s)]
*  interrupted by a terrible administration. Absolutely terrible. They didn't know what [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  they were doing. And now we're putting it back together. And I think it's going to end [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  up being much stronger than it was before. Even much stronger than it was before. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  President Trump, first of all, congratulations for the fantastic 24 days of your presidency. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm particularly impressed by the expose on USAID. And I would like you to share with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=193.78s)]
*  us if you think USAID had a role in election interference in the U.S. in 2020 and Indian [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=207.78s)]
*  elections in 2024. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=216.78s)]
*  So it could have had a role. There were a lot of bad things that happened in 2020. I [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=219.94000000000003s)]
*  think bad things happened in 2024, but it was too big to rig. We won by a tremendous [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=225.94000000000003s)]
*  margin. We won every swing state. We won the popular. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=230.94000000000003s)]
*  This is my favorite thing that Trump does when he just makes a foreign leader sit there [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=235.94000000000003s)]
*  and just responds to like the dumbest questions possible that have nothing to do with the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=241.66000000000003s)]
*  foreign nation. And they just have to kind of sit there and be like, oh, very cool. He [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=248.5s)]
*  does this every single time. It's amazing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=253.98s)]
*  We had a great 2016. We had a much better 2020 election, but bad things happened. And [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=259.34s)]
*  we had the best of all. We had, they say the most consequential in history, 129 years, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=266.9s)]
*  consequential. So it was a great election and it gives me a chance to work again with [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=273.97999999999996s)]
*  the prime minister and Indian. We're going to be we're going to have a great relationship [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=279.26s)]
*  together. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=284.26s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=285.26s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=288.26s)]
*  Do you see India playing a role in your plan to broker a peace in Ukraine? And if I could [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=289.26s)]
*  ask you about a development in your hometown today, the U.S. attorney has resigned over [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=302.58s)]
*  the request to drop the case into Eric Adams. Did you personally request the Justice Department [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=307.58s)]
*  to drop that case? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=312.58s)]
*  No, I didn't. I know nothing about it. I did not. I think that just to answer your other [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=313.58s)]
*  question, we're just going to get along well. We're going to get along with all countries. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=321.42s)]
*  We're going to do very well. We're going to be doing, I think, record business, record [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=326.42s)]
*  business numbers. And we're going to work with India also. We have some very big trade [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  deals to announce in the very near future. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  What happened? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  India is not at all involved in the peace process. India is not involved in the peace [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=340.46000000000004s)]

*  process. India is not at all involved in Ukraine is a crazy thing to say, considering that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=360.46s)]
*  anytime there's India becomes a secondary market to, to, to, you know, basically continue [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=365.46s)]
*  trade with the, the recipients of said sessions. So no, they play a very formative role. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=374.46s)]
*  Sorrows and what is the role that the deep state played in the situation? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=382.46s)]
*  Well, there was no role for our deep state. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=385.46s)]
*  Yeah, India is buying Russian oil to sell to the West and the West is okay with that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=388.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=391.46s)]
*  For a long time and has been worked on for hundreds of years. Frankly, I've been reading [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=392.46s)]
*  about it, but I will leave Bangladesh to the Prime Minister. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=396.46s)]
*  Oh, he's doing the Illuminati hand gesture chatter. You're right. Stay woke. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=400.46s)]
*  In the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=445.46s)]
*  Russian Ukraine conflict is concerned. I'm very happy that President Trump has taken [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=466.46s)]
*  initiatives to restore peace and had telephone calls with the president Putin and president [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=470.46s)]
*  Zelensky. The world had this thinking that India somehow is a neutral country in this [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=475.46s)]
*  whole process, but this is not true. India has a side and that side is of peace. From [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=481.46s)]
*  the very first day I have been talking about the importance of dialogue and diplomacy and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=486.46s)]
*  a peaceful solution. And when I met president Putin in the presence of media, I had told [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=492.46s)]
*  him that this is not the era and I have firm conviction that problems cannot be resolved [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=497.46s)]
*  on the battlefield. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=502.46s)]
*  You're actually wrong. Our sir Modi Vishwaguru ji actually stopped the Ukraine by telling [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=503.46s)]
*  both Russia and Ukraine that was bad. My bad. My bad. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=510.46s)]
*  The BJP ran a campaign during the 2024 general elections where they said Modi stopped over [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=519.46s)]
*  the last year. He ran in Russia. He did. Dang. This chat is so racist. Wait, what? What is [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=523.46s)]
*  what's racist about? I think we went a long way toward getting a solution to the horrible [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=529.46s)]
*  where so many people are being killed, especially soldiers on the battlefield. I think you guys [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=534.46s)]
*  are misunderstanding that my chatters are making fun of the hogs in India by explaining [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=539.46s)]
*  what the Modi campaign did that was a lie. Also, there's Indian Hassan Abiy heads in [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=549.46s)]
*  here including Arun. Also, saying that this community is hateful to the people of Russia [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=559.46s)]
*  Indians is pretty funny when you know this is one of the few communities as in the case [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=578.46s)]
*  with everything else that actually tries to to the best of their ability, combat anti-Indian [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=583.46s)]
*  sentiment anywhere else on the Internet that you go to as many of the Indian Hassan Abiy [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=589.46s)]
*  heads will openly admit. You can't even show an Indian person without literally the entirety [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=596.46s)]
*  of chat saying the most heinous hateful shit possible. It's crazy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=602.46s)]
*  Some Indian hogs think Trump is a secret Muslim. Oh, I love that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=622.46s)]
*  Last they say the last three weeks was among the best three weeks that Nokia phone ringtone [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=632.46s)]
*  is basically bringing me back to my childhood. I haven't heard that shit since I left Turkey, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=638.46s)]
*  dude. Even the Prime Minister mentioned it. I think almost all of my phones were Nokia. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=644.46s)]
*  I just want to thank everyone growing up. This is a terrific man. We're going to make [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=650.46s)]
*  some wonderful trade deals for India and for the US. And thank you all very much. Thank [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=655.46s)]
*  you. Thank you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=660.46s)]
*  Stand up. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=676.46s)]
*  Are a lot of haters as people with a plunge king who can only pay attention to the news [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=682.46s)]
*  of a daddy figure is yelling at them during it? Yes. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=685.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMatzzmNr_s&t=690.46s)]
