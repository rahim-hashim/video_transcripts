# Jon Stewart Interview Ta-Nehisi Coates On “The Message” | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM)
*  But it's crazy. John Stewart still has not accused him of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=0.0s)]
*  loving is weird to me that John Stewart has yet to accuse him [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=3.02s)]
*  of writing a book that will create more or something I don't [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  know. Weird. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=13.06s)]
*  Let's get back to a person who is also but I suspect as a child [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=19.34s)]
*  and not as an adult, John Stewart. Now, John Stewart is not [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=26.44s)]
*  a convert. But he is Jewish. And let's hear what his interview [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  looked like, as opposed to the Tony, whatever that guy's name [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=38.16s)]
*  is, Tony Dukakis. I keep forgetting his last name. Anyway, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=42.92s)]
*  I don't know why I'm transitioning off the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=47.44s)]
*  circumcision, but I do have it on my mind. It is hard for me to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=49.0s)]
*  not see it. Let's continue. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=53.74s)]
*  You are grappling. This is a book of grappling. It's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=56.22s)]
*  reparations, the purpose of art, the purpose of writing your [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=60.9s)]
*  role, your responsibility, the Israel, Palestine. I can see you [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=66.14s)]
*  want to go back to just writing comic books again for five [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=73.7s)]
*  years. What was in you that you thought I need to take on these [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=75.94s)]
*  big questions, including what is this for? What is writing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=82.62s)]
*  for? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=86.72s)]
*  I have for a long time had in the back of my head that we do [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=87.28s)]
*  not have a complete understanding of politics. That is to say, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  we think of politics as what happens inside of a voting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  booth. You go in and you choose, you know, pull a lever for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=96.84s)]
*  whatever. But there's a whole entire architecture that happens [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  outside of that voting booth that defines what goes on inside [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  of it, what issues are appropriate, frankly, who is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  human and who is not. That is the work of stories, movies, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=108.96s)]
*  television shows, writing, all of that. Being a writer, and this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  coming out of me talking to my students at Howard University at [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  the time, I really, really wanted to address that. So often [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=121.58s)]
*  I get the question, why should I write? In general, by the time [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  they get to me, my students are there. But a lot of other times [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=129.34s)]
*  when I'm out in the world, what is writing going to do? What is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=132.78s)]
*  it actually going to change? What I want people to understand [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=136.38s)]
*  is writing actually shapes the world around you entirely. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=138.54s)]
*  Right. See, I would have said basic cable, but okay. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=141.12s)]
*  But somebody has to write the scripts, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=143.76s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=145.6s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=146.76s)]
*  Is that, do you grapple with that as a burden or a call to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=148.04s)]
*  arms? What is for you? How do you wear it? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=154.32s)]
*  Oh, it's exciting. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=159.0s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it gets me up in the morning. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=162.2s)]
*  It like pumps my blood. Like I can't wait. You know what I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=162.64s)]
*  mean? Like there are people who, I got a friend who's an ER [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=166.26s)]
*  doc, right? And I was texting this morning about, you know, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  everything that was going on. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=171.33999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=172.33999999999997s)]
*  And he disappeared. He said, sorry, this guy just got shot. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry. And I said to him, how beautiful is it to have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=175.17999999999998s)]
*  work that actually matters? Like y'all out there saving [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=179.61999999999998s)]
*  people's lives. And I'm not an ER doctor, but it is a blessing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=181.82s)]
*  to feel like what I write actually matters in the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=185.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=188.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? It gives me meaning and purpose. And I [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=189.33999999999997s)]
*  kind of wanted to convey that, you know, to all the young [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=192.12s)]
*  writers, you know, who hopefully as inspiration. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=194.94s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=197.12s)]
*  So beautiful. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=197.76s)]
*  Your friend was at work when the guy got shot. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=198.12s)]
*  He was. Yes, he was. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=200.0s)]
*  Because for a second I was like, wait, he was at work. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=201.76s)]
*  Yeah, he was. He was at work. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=203.32s)]
*  It wasn't like you were talking to me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=204.68s)]
*  No, no, no, no. He was at work. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=205.64s)]
*  All right. That's very good. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=207.12s)]
*  Do you get frustrated, and this is something that I think about [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  sometimes, that the world that you would prefer to see, that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=212.96s)]
*  the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice and the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=217.88s)]
*  work of writing is trying to help facilitate that, that it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  is that that arc of moral justice is so resilient against [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  bending, that it's so hard to matter in that form. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=229.9s)]
*  I get sad. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=234.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=235.74s)]
*  And there are a lot of moments in here where I was really sad. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=236.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, but at the same time, like I said, it fills me with [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=238.82s)]
*  purpose. I don't know if I would have that purpose I talked about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=243.86s)]
*  just a few minutes ago, you know, without that great [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=246.4s)]
*  difficulty. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=249.84s)]
*  Honestly, it feels great to know that if I actually try really, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  really hard at the thing, if I actually work really, really [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=256.32s)]
*  hard to write the best book I possibly can, you know, I could [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=259.12s)]
*  be here talking to you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=262.04s)]
*  That it actually really does me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=263.24s)]
*  Oh, you could have written a book and been on here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=263.96s)]
*  Listen, if that's the case, I can tell you, you didn't have to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=266.76s)]
*  work. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=270.44s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=270.84s)]
*  I feel like this is nearly as hard. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=272.04s)]
*  This is too much glaze, bro. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=274.36s)]
*  Talk about the cool stuff. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=276.04s)]
*  But it is. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=277.66s)]
*  It's a beautifully felt book. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=278.14000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask holy cow. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=279.70000000000005s)]
*  Long time watcher. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=281.18s)]
*  First time commenter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  Why verify to counts only? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=282.88s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=284.48s)]
*  Anyway, listen, Tony's he calls wrote about his, his change in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=285.18s)]
*  attitude towards the recognition of Palestinians as human beings. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=289.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  And most of the media was like shocked by it almost because [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=294.92s)]
*  they're like, you're one of us. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  Like you're in the halls of intelligentsia. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  You're not supposed to say like that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=301.70000000000005s)]
*  And that's pretty much it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=304.0s)]
*  And his categorization from one of the chosen ones to someone who [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=305.76s)]
*  is going to quickly fall out of favor has absolutely been noticeable. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=312.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=317.2s)]
*  In inside of like the liberal media ecosystem, you do still have [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=318.2s)]
*  people who are extremely critical of Israel that get, you know, some [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=323.44s)]
*  space a lot of to them every now and then, but overall someone like [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=328.58000000000004s)]
*  Ta-Nehisi Coates doing that is actually unique because he goes from like [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  being at the tippy top of liberal intelligentsia to being D ranked. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  There are, there are not a lot of people who have gotten to that level. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=343.84s)]
*  Like this is Barack Obama's favorite writer. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=348.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  This is Barack Obama's favorite author being like, yo, Israel's doing it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=351.65999999999997s)]
*  I saw from, I saw it with my own damn eyes. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  Like this is unacceptable. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=357.82s)]
*  There's a certain aspect of your career that has really tried to. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=359.62s)]
*  It's not even clear why Libs propped him up in the first place. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=365.32000000000005s)]
*  His OG work is just as controversial as his Palestine take. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=367.8s)]
*  Um, I mean, I think he's still a liberal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  That's why he has like, uh, he has a, uh, is an idealistic notion of how [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  things work for the most part. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=379.88s)]
*  Also talking about reparations and making a case for reparations is very [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=381.6s)]
*  different than like directly, especially in the United States of America, where [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=385.32s)]
*  like that seems, um, that seems so far out of reach as opposed to like directly [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  criticizing, as opposed to directly criticizing our ongoing with a regime is [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=398.22s)]
*  a little different to reconcile not with things in the present, but their vestiges, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=404.2s)]
*  the structures, uh, racial politics, slavery, economic injustices, where it [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=411.68s)]
*  might not be the active virus, but it's these vestiges of it that's still, you [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=419.04s)]
*  know, for the record, um, Jon Stewart gets to obviously criticize Israel, but I mean, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=424.16s)]
*  he is a comedian into the groundwater and make it toxic and polluted. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  This book felt a little different in that you were also going into the present [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=437.62s)]
*  and bringing those lessons with you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=443.1s)]
*  And I thought, I thought that was a really moving part of the book. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=445.74s)]
*  Yeah, that that's true. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  And, uh, I guess I'm going to be the one to broach this, but, uh, it was obviously [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=451.26s)]
*  most active when I was in Jerusalem, when I was in Haifa, when I was on the West [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=455.5s)]
*  Bank, I mean, it was, it was the history, but the history was active and that was, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=459.06s)]
*  um, that was tough. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=464.22s)]
*  That was something. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=466.14s)]
*  I'm used to, you know, going to some slave plantation and saying, well, yeah, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=466.62s)]
*  this did happen 150 years ago, but here's how, you know, you can still feel the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=470.4s)]
*  impact and you got, no, no, it's right now. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=475.8s)]
*  It's, it's right now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=476.04s)]
*  And it comes on the heels of, so in the book, you're also, you take a trip to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=477.36s)]
*  Senegal, I do, yes. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=480.6s)]
*  Is, is that in relation to your trip to, uh, Israel and the West Bank in that same [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=482.72s)]
*  timeframe, or is that, was that split up? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=488.68s)]
*  It was about, it was, so I think I went in, uh, this would have been like [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=490.44s)]
*  September of 2022 to Senegal and then May of 23, uh, to the West Bank and to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=495.04s)]
*  Israel and, um, weirdly enough, they are in conversation with each other. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=501.06s)]
*  I can't say I intended that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=507.1s)]
*  Well, that's, that's why I was curious. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=507.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=509.06s)]
*  Fine. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=510.06s)]
*  He went against the grain in his case, but liberals shouldn't get a medal for [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=510.38s)]
*  doing the bare minimum of recognizing the humanity of other people. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=513.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, dog, but you coming to the conclusion that what Israel is doing is [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=515.98s)]
*  unconscionable, uh, is not the same as him doing that with his platform. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=520.58s)]
*  The amount of social and political capital that he is basically expending in an [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=526.0s)]
*  effort to utilize his cherished platform. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=531.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=535.2800000000001s)]
*  And broad recognition and celebration from liberal intelligentsia to say [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=536.12s)]
*  something like this is brave and should be celebrated, especially when you've [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=540.76s)]
*  literally written an article celebrating Israel and then recognizing the errors in [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=546.16s)]
*  what you have done. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=552.14s)]

*  My mom visited our oxen mosque in 2022 and is really weird listening to her [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=573.9s)]
*  experience with the checkpoints and hours of waiting and investigations. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=577.22s)]

*  visit Israel and don't have to go through any of that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=582.9399999999999s)]

*  Palestinian experience, dude. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=587.22s)]
*  What matters is when you see it and, and how you are moved from that experience [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=589.62s)]
*  is there's cause there is nothing in it for him to come out. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=595.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=599.22s)]
*  There's nothing in it for him to come out and defend Palestinian [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=599.74s)]

*  See the, see the, see the with his eyes and then whitewash it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=607.0400000000001s)]

*  It's so strange to me. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=635.0s)]
*  And I think that this is something that you guys really, really, if you, if this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=636.92s)]
*  is an opinion that you hold, you really should not have this opinion any longer. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=641.7199999999999s)]

*  Okay. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=656.0s)]
*  And it is at the heart of my understanding of rehabilitation over incarceration. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=657.14s)]
*  It is at my, it is in my commentary. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=662.42s)]
*  Whenever I talk about cancel culture, it is very important to me and it should be [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=665.1s)]
*  important to you as well. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=670.46s)]

*  It's at the heart of building a large and successful movement. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=683.44s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=691.28s)]

*  Okay. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=724.7s)]
*  Especially because so many of you also went through this journey on your own. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=725.38s)]

*  I went through this journey. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=732.34s)]
*  We all did. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=734.02s)]

*  Like that's crazy, man. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=737.22s)]
*  Half of this community did not agree with most of the things that I advocate for before [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=739.0799999999999s)]
*  they encountered this community and became productive members of this community. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=746.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=750.8s)]
*  I'm not going to sit here and debate about this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=754.48s)]

*  Cause you have a line in the book that I think is, is one of the most powerful, which [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=844.12s)]
*  is, and I want to make sure that I get it right. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=848.9200000000001s)]

*  I was raised with full Zionist indoctrination, uh, camp. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=856.24s)]
*  And even after seeing the West bank, it was hard to shake so much of the ingrained [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=859.28s)]
*  trust that was brainwashed with chatters. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=861.86s)]
*  Don't understand what it's like unless you go through it takes balls for [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=863.36s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=876.76s)]
*  Unless you're like an evangelical or some like in growing up in the church, like many [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=877.64s)]
*  non-Jewish people don't go through that same level of indoctrination for them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=883.14s)]
*  It's more so like the only information they have is like severely limited. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=886.9s)]
*  And that is by design. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=891.8s)]
*  Of course, there isn't like extra justifications. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=892.7399999999999s)]
*  Uh, no, I know I'm saying I got that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=895.78s)]

*  Ta-Nehisi, uh, Coates is what I was saying. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=905.66s)]
*  Like it makes more sense for you to have, uh, to have gone through this upbringing [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=908.6s)]
*  and have like these hangups. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=914.0s)]
*  It's not, I think it's like truly, truly interesting that so many Americans are so [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=917.04s)]
*  careless and so indifferent to the cruelty that like, that they also arrive at similar [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=924.48s)]
*  points of view. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=932.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=933.36s)]
*  It blows my mind. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=934.32s)]

*  You know, I, my, my interpretation of, of, uh, Israel has as long as I've known myself, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=939.9s)]
*  at least has always been like, Oh, that's a country that like America is leading. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=948.4599999999999s)]
*  That's a country that is, is doing a lot of death and destruction in the region as a [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=953.38s)]
*  direct Imperial vestige, like not with those terms, but pretty much that is like the way [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  a lot of people from this area interpret Israel's existence as for understandable [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=964.94s)]
*  reasons that many of you have been, have become more aware of since October 7. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=970.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=976.0400000000001s)]
*  I expect a lot of non-Israeli Jews have become anti-Zionists over the past year, but [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=976.6400000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of pressure from the community to stuff it away because we have a tribal [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=979.72s)]
*  mentality where we're scared. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=982.6800000000001s)]

*  You are not a self-hating Jew. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=986.24s)]

*  I mean, look, I'm not Jewish, obviously, but having said that your perspective as a [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  Jew is closer to Jewish culture, Jewish tradition, and Jewish history than Zionist [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=996.78s)]
*  Jews are straight up. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1002.22s)]

*  You literally are closer to Jewish tradition and Jewish history. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1010.42s)]
*  And there are obviously millions of Jews out there as well that you can look to for [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1015.96s)]
*  pointers on this. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1023.5200000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1024.72s)]
*  Hasan, if it was a three-year-old Twitter mom's talk about, no dog, I'm just from a [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1026.88s)]

*  What are you talking about? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1031.76s)]

*  of Israel is very different. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1043.48s)]
*  This is something that a lot of Americans don't understand. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1044.7800000000002s)]
*  Like, you know how when we look at like Chinese Internet and we're like shocked at [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1046.8600000000001s)]

*  OK, and it's still very different than like, obviously, my upbringing. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1063.74s)]
*  But yeah, it's just that's just what it is, is social conditioning. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1067.74s)]
*  I'm saying that I didn't have to like work super hard to arrive at these conclusions. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1071.8400000000001s)]

*  Having said that, of course, I did a lot of reading to truly comprehend the scope and [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1080.3200000000002s)]
*  the nature of this conflict and the inhumanity. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1084.92s)]
*  But, you know, culturally speaking, my understanding was or my posture against [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1088.0400000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1209.72s)]
*  You don't have to imagine them because I literally show chat so you can see all [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1209.88s)]

*  black experience in America, but also about the Jewish experience in the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1225.06s)]
*  Holocaust as well as in, in Israel. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1229.7s)]
*  And what did you mean by that? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1233.66s)]
*  I think we would like to think that you go through, you know, horrific experience, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1235.82s)]
*  be it the middle passes, Jim Crow here, be it the Holocaust or the centuries before [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1241.74s)]

*  And somehow you will be morally improved by coming out of that. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1250.58s)]
*  You might be, you might be, but it's just as likely that you will conclude that in [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1254.74s)]
*  fact, the world is a cold, hard place and it's a zero sum game. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1260.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1265.64s)]

*  You know, I stand opposed to that. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1268.7s)]
*  Just on principle period. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1271.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1272.76s)]
*  Um, but I get how people take that lesson, right? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1273.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1277.32s)]
*  And I think it's disconfitting for us to feel because we feel sympathy for people. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1277.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1282.1599999999999s)]
*  When we, I'm walking through Yad Vashem and I'm feeling it on a very, very deep [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1282.6s)]
*  level only to come back here and realize I was, you know, about a mile away from a [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1287.28s)]
*  massacre of a Palestinian village. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1292.8s)]
*  That's hard to take. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1295.32s)]
*  Hey, it's, you know what I mean? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1296.52s)]
*  I was, I'm raised in obviously cultural Jewish tradition. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1298.1000000000001s)]
*  And I imagine, you know, if you were to feel like the name of your people did some [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1302.94s)]
*  things that you found objectionable, it hits you different. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1308.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1312.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1312.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1312.8600000000001s)]
*  No, it does. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1312.9s)]
*  It does. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1313.58s)]
*  It does. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1313.8600000000001s)]
*  And it's not a complete parallel, but that's why in that chapter, I wanted to talk a [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1314.26s)]
*  little bit about Liberia for instance, you know what I mean? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1317.54s)]
*  And just the idea, I get it. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1319.6200000000001s)]
*  The appeal of, Hey, we're going to have a state of our own. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1321.1000000000001s)]
*  We're going to get away from these people that did, you know, X, Y, and Z for us. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1323.02s)]
*  We will have safety there. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1326.16s)]
*  And yet then you find yourself enacting, you know, systems that if not are the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1328.32s)]
*  same or similar, at least, you know, morally deeply problematic. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1333.24s)]
*  And having to justify them through either threat or the situation, or you don't [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1337.88s)]
*  understand. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1341.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1342.6s)]
*  And what I'm, what I'm wondering is, is that the story in a condensed form of all [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1342.84s)]
*  of us is does, does for society to progress, does there also have to be [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1349.02s)]
*  exploitation? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1356.26s)]
*  Do you grapple with this idea that when we think about anything, whether it's the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1357.18s)]
*  American story or the Israeli store or any of those, it's stories of empire, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1362.58s)]
*  whether it was the Ottoman empire or the Caliphate, it's groups of people. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1368.78s)]
*  Yo, hey, chill. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1372.5s)]
*  John, you're about to get on my bad side. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1374.3s)]
*  Hey, yo, you're about to get on my bad side, dog. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1377.1999999999998s)]
*  Yo. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1380.9199999999998s)]
*  Living under the, why you say me for bro? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1382.0s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1384.76s)]
*  Brace of a leader who controls their lives. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1385.28s)]
*  And can we progress outside of that? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1389.6399999999999s)]
*  Is there an, is there, do you think about, is there another way to do this? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1392.1599999999999s)]
*  Has there been another way to do this? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1395.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1397.6799999999998s)]
*  If we shine that light on any country that, that, that grew through, won't there [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1397.9599999999998s)]
*  be a story of exploitation and mistreatment that we find? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1404.26s)]
*  Maybe not as horrific, but, but we find it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1407.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1409.9s)]
*  I think though we have to guard against the temptation to accept that history is [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1410.38s)]
*  necessarily the limit of who we are as human beings. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1416.58s)]
*  That just because, I mean, you know, that that's been, you know, that it's been that [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1419.38s)]
*  way, that it necessarily has to be that way. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1422.42s)]
*  I will for instance, highlight, you know, the underlying role of, of nationalism and [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1424.74s)]
*  the belief that a nation state is the way to secure and safeguard a minority. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1429.22s)]
*  That is a very recent development as a belief system, actually. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1434.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1437.98s)]
*  You know, that is not eternal. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1438.26s)]
*  That's not. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1439.74s)]
*  Prior to that, wouldn't it have been tribalism or wouldn't it have been something? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1440.1s)]
*  It would have been a king. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1443.66s)]
*  It would have been a pope. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1445.3s)]
*  It would have been, you know, my allegiance is, you know, X, Y, and Z. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1446.38s)]
*  But what I'm saying is it is not innate in us to say, I am of this ethnicity. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1449.02s)]
*  We should all have a state together. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1454.9s)]
*  And perhaps more importantly, we should deny rights to people who are not of that [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1456.38s)]
*  ethnicity. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1459.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1460.34s)]
*  We don't have to be that way. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1460.6200000000001s)]
*  We don't have to be that way. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1462.38s)]
*  A man from your lips to God's ears. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1463.4s)]
*  I always wonder, you know, there was that, I can't remember the experiment, but it was [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1466.44s)]
*  the assigned class where people with brown hair got privileges. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1471.2s)]
*  He's already gone. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1473.72s)]
*  And all of a sudden people with blonde hair were like, and they got sad. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1474.6000000000001s)]
*  And then the people with brown hair started to kind of abuse the people with blonde [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1478.6000000000001s)]
*  hair. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1483.3200000000002s)]
*  And there's a part of me that thinks, boy, we could solve religious differences and [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1483.8s)]
*  somehow we would go back to each other over something else. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1488.98s)]
*  Equally is arbitrary. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1493.1000000000001s)]
*  And that I'm wondering how you get that that zero sum game element that you witnessed [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1495.14s)]
*  up front out of it, because I'd like to believe it's not malevolence, but ignorance and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1502.06s)]
*  fear. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1509.02s)]
*  I think it's a lot of fear. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1509.7s)]
*  And frankly, I think it's a lot of anger. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1510.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1512.6200000000001s)]
*  I think and obviously for obvious reasons, you would know this better than me. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1513.14s)]
*  But I sense that a lot of it is the humiliation of the Holocaust. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1516.54s)]
*  I think that is, you know, very, very much present. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1520.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1523.12s)]
*  And not feeling like I will never be in that position again. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1524.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1527.32s)]
*  You know, that's a that is at least everything I've read from Jewish scholars that [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1527.92s)]
*  interpret Zionism. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1536.68s)]
*  He's 100 percent on the money. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1538.84s)]
*  Like it is it is it is a I mean, he's right. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1541.1000000000001s)]
*  The really good, the really good way to interpret it. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1544.98s)]
*  Well, never. I mean, never again. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1549.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1551.46s)]
*  I think the thing that so many Jewish people and not everybody look, it's not a monolith [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1552.18s)]
*  either. Jewish religion, Jewish culture is certainly not a monolith. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1557.2600000000002s)]
*  And there's many different opinions. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1560.8200000000002s)]
*  I think if we start from a baseline of I would like a safe and secure Israel and a safe [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1562.5800000000002s)]
*  and secure Palestine. And that's my starting point to any argument. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1567.94s)]
*  And then we're just talking strategy. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1572.48s)]
*  But I think the idea of never again, you don't you try to internalize it, not just as a [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1574.64s)]
*  self-defense kind of dictum. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1583.8s)]
*  You hope to think of that as never again for anyone. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1586.88s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  And and that's the part that feels the worst. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1592.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. When when when you look at it in in that way. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1595.9s)]
*  Explain how it's possible for Harris Biden supporters are OK and opposed with what's [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1599.9s)]
*  happening in those so backwards. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1603.8200000000002s)]
*  The man sees some completely OK with everything, but some against. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1605.14s)]
*  But both parties are in support of Harris Biden. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1608.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's easy. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1610.42s)]
*  American American foreign policy is brutal and seemingly unchanging. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1611.5s)]
*  So we as a society have deliberately kind of put that on the back burner. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1617.4s)]
*  We never think about it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1623.16s)]
*  Just the thing that happens. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1624.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1626.56s)]
*  Also, people are selfish and don't really care. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1627.48s)]
*  People are so selfish, don't even care about like their neighbors. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1630.92s)]
*  They certainly don't care about a group of scary, barbaric animals that they've seen on [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1634.44s)]
*  TV constantly calling for the death and destruction of the United States of America, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1640.08s)]
*  that they have been conditioned into believing is an enemy of theirs. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1646.26s)]
*  And I'm curious how you feel, you know, so in Africa, you know, I'm curious about what [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1650.14s)]
*  you think about this idea of diaspora. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1655.38s)]
*  Yeah. When people are in diasporas and it carries this weight of you are lost, you [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1657.5s)]
*  are not in a place where you can, you know, I don't think Italian people who live in [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1664.5s)]
*  America think of themselves as I'm in a diaspora. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1668.34s)]
*  They think of themselves as like, I'll take a tour. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1671.6200000000001s)]
*  Maybe when I'm older, you know, the Jewish people, black people, there's this feeling [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1673.4s)]
*  of somehow we're not safe. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1676.96s)]
*  And I feel like that's a dangerous, that's a dangerous thing. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1680.7600000000002s)]
*  Does it not come from being degraded and being made to feel like you are outside of [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1684.7600000000002s)]
*  the place that maybe you would like to call home? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1692.0800000000002s)]
*  This is great. That's interesting. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1695.24s)]
*  Book, The Pity of It All. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1696.96s)]
*  It's about Jews in Germany. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1698.68s)]
*  Are you going to make me read something else? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1701.24s)]
*  It's going to be quick. I promise to be quick about this. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1703.08s)]
*  I'm still just getting through Breaking Bad. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1704.98s)]
*  I can't even. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1706.82s)]
*  But it's all of these, you know, Jews who are all these German Jews who want to be [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1708.3799999999999s)]
*  German. Right. Like they really, really want to believe in Germany. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1712.34s)]
*  Right. And they get the Holocaust. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1715.74s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? Like that has to assault your sense of, you know, the idea [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1718.3799999999999s)]
*  that you can somehow be safe out. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1723.58s)]
*  And then how much then does humiliation play a part in all of it, including kind of what [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1725.3s)]
*  has been what we would consider the modern age version of exploitation and colonialism? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1730.48s)]
*  Like, I mean, even when we think about the regions that you were that you went into, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1735.8400000000001s)]
*  yeah, were kind of a post World War One mandate that was drawn, you know, Lebanese, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1740.16s)]
*  Syrian, Palestine mandate. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1745.8s)]
*  The French are going to take this. The English are going to take that. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1747.68s)]
*  I mean, it's it's, you know, pawns on a board that people are are moving around. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1750.6000000000001s)]
*  And does that humiliate a region to the point where if we don't address that, we [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1757.34s)]
*  can't get through it? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1762.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I think so. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1763.9s)]
*  I mean, I I will say that one of the hard things about that and getting a little too [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1766.02s)]
*  psychological about this is I spent 10 days there. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1772.02s)]
*  So, you know, at all. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1775.82s)]
*  One of the tough things was, I have to tell you, the perspective of Palestinians and the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1777.3s)]
*  extent to which their perspective has been pushed so far out of the frame was [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1782.22s)]
*  incredible. I felt like I was seeing a new world. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1787.84s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? And that's like shameful for me to admit. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1790.08s)]
*  I'm not bragging about that. You know, it's not because that world wasn't there. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1793.04s)]
*  That world doesn't you know, hasn't been trying to present itself. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1795.6000000000001s)]
*  But I mean, I just wonder how many of these conversations would be improved if our [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1798.4s)]
*  media organizations made a concerted effort whenever they talk about this topic to [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1803.76s)]
*  ask, do we have anybody Palestinian that we've invited to allow it on the Democratic [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1808.84s)]
*  Convention floor? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1815.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I think access to different stories has always been a [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1816.22s)]
*  difficulty for America in general because of that sort of solipsistic worldview. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1821.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, we we tend to be slightly narcissistic. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1826.1399999999999s)]
*  I find it really hard to accept Israelis doing it because they never want to go [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1829.78s)]
*  through it again. No, no, no, no, no. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1832.4599999999998s)]
*  That's not that it's that's not what anybody here is saying. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1834.34s)]
*  They're saying that the the like at its very core, Zionism like has built that [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1838.5200000000002s)]
*  understanding into its into its very foundation that like never again to us it [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1847.5600000000002s)]
*  did, you know, unimaginable atrocities have occurred. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1855.24s)]
*  It's not a real justification. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1858.5200000000002s)]
*  It's a false justification. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1860.44s)]
*  It's just it's propaganda. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1862.4s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1864.5200000000002s)]
*  And that's precisely the reason why there's so many. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1865.5600000000002s)]
*  Dude, there are so many academics, dude. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1867.56s)]
*  There are so many goddamn scholars specifically that cover the Holocaust, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1870.06s)]
*  specifically that cover that are Jewish themselves that also say the exact same [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1874.7s)]
*  things that I am saying. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1880.06s)]
*  OK, it's like you cannot be that close and make it your lives work and then not [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1882.02s)]
*  recognize right from wrong. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1889.7s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1891.6599999999999s)]
*  Is it do you think Zionism is reactionary movement? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1893.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1895.62s)]
*  It is an ethno-nationalistic fascist movement built around supremacy of one [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1896.52s)]
*  group. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1901.88s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1902.48s)]
*  Of course it is a reactionary movement. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1903.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1906.0s)]
*  So fucking lutely. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1906.28s)]
*  What's more interesting is that given the historical background that it was built on [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1907.4s)]
*  top of and it has been able to, I guess, infiltrate as though it is a progressive [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1914.76s)]
*  ideology. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1921.56s)]
*  Like it's kind of wild on that front, especially because it's also attached in a [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1922.28s)]
*  defensive posture against like real bigotry. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1926.28s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is a real bigotry. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1928.86s)]
*  It's autistic when it comes to the vision of it. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1930.74s)]
*  And it's such a necessary thing. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1934.62s)]
*  I wonder if it really improves it. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1936.78s)]
*  I mean, here's something that I grapple with. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1939.3s)]
*  I've known about it forever. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1942.5s)]
*  I have friends who have Palestinian families who've suffered through it. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1943.78s)]
*  I have friends in Israel who suffered through it. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1948.18s)]
*  And it sometimes feels as though the only people that benefit are the powers that be [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1950.46s)]
*  and all these good people are so left behind by weird power structure that we left in [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1955.6399999999999s)]
*  place there. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1964.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1965.08s)]
*  And I don't. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1966.2399999999998s)]
*  But you bring up an interesting point, which is a path forward of reconciling [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1967.2399999999998s)]
*  humiliation. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1973.32s)]
*  And I don't know what is the mechanism of that. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1974.2399999999998s)]
*  Is there one? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1977.4399999999998s)]
*  And is it that sort of, you know, you think about South Africa and truth and [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1978.3999999999999s)]
*  reconciliation. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1980.8799999999999s)]
*  But is there a mechanism to heal that for people or is it purely self-determination? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1981.58s)]
*  And that's, you know, I don't know. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1987.22s)]
*  Well, that's all the time we have. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1989.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1992.98s)]
*  But it is. I wonder because you bring up such an interesting it is such a powerful [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1993.46s)]
*  river of emotion. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1997.62s)]
*  I think I think Ta-Nehisi Coase is more of an overt anti-Sinist than John Stewart is, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=1999.1799999999998s)]
*  I would say. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2005.3s)]
*  But, you know, that's neither here nor there besides the point. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2006.26s)]
*  When you say I can almost not cry talking about. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2008.98s)]
*  John Stewart, however, historically is one of the most like mainstream figures that [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2011.14s)]
*  has been very critical of Israel, like significantly more critical of Israel than [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2016.44s)]

*  And I'll tell you this from the from the black perspective. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2047.74s)]
*  There is great not always spoken shame in the black community over the kind of [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2049.94s)]
*  physical traumas we've endured. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2058.06s)]

*  There is not a single pure African African-American who came through asleep. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2066.88s)]
*  There is an amount of humiliation in that. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2071.96s)]
*  There is an amount of humiliation in watching. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2074.32s)]
*  And I've written about this films from the 60s and watching these kids and these [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2077.0800000000004s)]

*  George Floyd, you know, a knee on his neck. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2086.92s)]
*  And I do think a significant part of it is understanding, particularly with the past, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2090.0800000000004s)]

*  It's not true that these people just willingly, you know, you know, went to it. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2102.86s)]
*  There was a slogan out for a while. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2106.3s)]

*  What do you think a chattel slavery breeding program looks like? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2117.82s)]
*  Black people were not bred. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2120.86s)]

*  I can't believe I'm using this terminology, but like black people were every black person [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2125.1s)]
*  under chattel slavery that had sex with a white person was raped. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2130.52s)]

*  They were slaves. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2136.68s)]
*  It's not a claim. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2137.7599999999998s)]
*  It's just the objective reality is due to say, can you get him on stream? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2138.56s)]
*  I'd love to get Ta-Nehisi Coates on stream. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2142.56s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2148.68s)]
*  We're not going to be punked and chumped. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2149.04s)]
*  Yes, we would. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2150.7599999999998s)]

*  We're no better. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2153.72s)]
*  We're no braver. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2154.5s)]
*  You know, there's such an analog with that with the Jewish community. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2155.26s)]
*  And there is, you know, and you hear it a lot about, you know, the first thing Hitler did is he disarmed the Jews. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2158.46s)]
*  And you're like, Jews were not like gun totem. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2164.26s)]
*  You know, if you were taking us, maybe that would have been something like, oh, they disarmed the Jews. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2168.42s)]
*  And that's how Hitler was able to get the Jews to do that. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2172.7400000000002s)]
*  That literally is like a reactionary framework, by the way. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2175.9s)]
*  It's also a historical and unironically is like a Zionist framework. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2180.44s)]
*  The idea that like Jews were disarmed, like they were that they were not strong enough to fight back. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2186.4s)]
*  Like that is what the that's what the other side of that conversation looks like. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2192.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's one historically incorrect. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2197.4s)]
*  Um. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2200.5s)]
*  There were definitely some gun toting on the Jewish side, both on the Allied Forces front, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2204.78s)]
*  specifically, specifically inside of the Red Army, but also beyond that in the American front. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2210.78s)]
*  And also beyond that, the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and many other forms of Jewish resistance. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2219.98s)]
*  No, I'm not talking about Stern and Irgun, dude. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2225.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm not talking about I'm talking about. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2228.1s)]
*  I'm talking about like the good fight. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2230.32s)]
*  OK, not the bad fight anyway. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2232.4s)]
*  You're like, oh, you know who had guns and didn't do too well with Hitler? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2234.6800000000003s)]
*  France. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2238.88s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2241.48s)]
*  There's that sense of like, how could you let your people, how could you allow that to happen? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2242.4s)]
*  And it does skew their perspectives. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2250.32s)]
*  And I can already see your next book. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2253.14s)]

*  It's really it's an amazing piece. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2259.7s)]
*  And the main thing is. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2261.8199999999997s)]
*  This this interview, this conversation wasn't as good as I thought it would be. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2265.22s)]
*  I mean, I'm glad that it wasn't as like it wasn't hostile or contentious, but there's. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2269.18s)]
*  And listen, man, like, let's not kid ourselves. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2273.46s)]
*  Once you delve into Israel Palestine, you're going to take a ton. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2276.1s)]
*  I don't know where it's it'll come from everywhere. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2278.42s)]
*  And I hope you don't wear it personally, but you've done the most important thing. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2280.7999999999997s)]
*  I just say one quick thing. Yes, please. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2286.0s)]
*  It will not measure up to the burdens of what I saw. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2287.44s)]
*  Palestinians on the West Bank Barrett. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2291.2s)]
*  It's not. That's an excellent point. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2292.84s)]
*  The only point I was going to make is through your discomfort, albeit not the same discomfort. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2297.04s)]
*  You've done the most important thing, which is try to advance and delve into [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT0RxJK5RcM&t=2303.44s)]
