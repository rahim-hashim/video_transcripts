# Brendan James & Noah Kulwin Interview Hasanabi On Israel Situation, Pol Pot & Viet Nam
**HasanAbi:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM)
*  I will say, I think ground offensive is pretty fine. I think that that is more or less what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=0.0s)]
*  an invasion like, like, like it's, it's, it's offensive, you know, it's not mincing there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4.64s)]
*  I think the FT gets a pass from me on that one, but the rest of them [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=11.68s)]
*  Speaker 0 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=14.36s)]
*  coverage on this stuff. I think from early October in general, much better than wall [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=15.36s)]
*  street journal, which is in the tank and has routinely spread misinformation. As a matter [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=22.72s)]
*  of fact, misinformation that like, if I recall correctly, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=27.68s)]
*  hello, hello. Can you guys hear me? I can't hear you at all, but that, oh, I can hear you, Brandon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=36.64s)]
*  All right. Noah. Oh, you are very, so why dude, what the heck? But you can't hear me. Yeah. I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=44.8s)]
*  mean, it's, I can barely hear you. It is like insanely quiet. This isn't the worst setup [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=52.88s)]
*  actually going forward. No is almost silent. Damn. Why does he, does he chirp too much in the, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=58.64s)]
*  in the appearances that you guys have been making so far? God, it's like, we barely, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=64.16s)]
*  we barely have anyone 30 minutes into the interview. Cause he just shut up. You're getting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=69.12s)]
*  better. It's getting a little bit better. What's this better crank it up higher Noah. And what [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=75.04s)]
*  about this? Oh, perfect. Boom. All right. Welcome back to the show. The blowback boys, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=80.88s)]
*  they're in the building, ready to let it rip. You guys have a, you guys have a new, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  you guys have a new series that just came out. Let me run the trailer for that. Actually. Do [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=95.84s)]
*  you have that link? Yeah. You drop it in the link. I found it. Let's get started with this first. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Here they were sending great numbers of troops into Cambodia preparing for what is called the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=107.84s)]
*  jet offensive that year. We take this action, not for the purpose of and Vietnam. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=113.28s)]
*  I do it again. It's just a dead end. We're still fighting Vietnam war. And if we have to use the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=127.12s)]
*  Camille Rouge as a pawn in that, we'll use them. I do it again. I do it again. I do it again. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=135.04s)]
*  I do it again. I do it again. I do it again. I do it again. I do it again. I do it again. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=143.04s)]
*  Some of the chatters are saying you guys gave Nixon and Kissinger too much aura. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=149.28s)]
*  The whole aura of that video, as was our last season's trailer is due to Ben Clarkson, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  who's the animator. He's a great illustrator. He has a new graphic novel out called Justice [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=162.16s)]
*  Warriors. Vote harder. So a lot of credit due to Ben. Also Dan Beckner, great musician, did that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=166.88s)]
*  doom guitar you hear in the middle with me and the track I wrote for it. So yeah, we like putting [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=174.16s)]
*  these little trailers together because we get to work with talented people like them. So credit to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=181.2s)]
*  them. Yeah, no, it's, it's fantastic. As always you guys done did it again. I'll admit I did text [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=188.4s)]
*  Noah the other day and I was like, when is the, when is the gladiote turkey edition of the blowback [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=195.68s)]
*  podcast series coming? Cause you know, I would, I would love to help out in any way I can on that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  And also I think is like a perfect, it's a target rich environment, you know, creating the terminology [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=208.56s)]
*  that we all love and use all the time, such as deep state where it comes from originally. Sure. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=214.72s)]
*  But yeah, we'll, we'll get to, we'll get to the Kim, our Rouge Nixon Kissinger and everything else. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=222.32s)]
*  But obviously I wanted to start the conversation at least in the first half by talking about what's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=228.48s)]
*  going on in terms of American imperialism, American empire on its last stand with our most valuable, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=233.44s)]
*  most important ally, the only moral country in the world, the only democracy in the world with the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=240.56s)]
*  most moral military Israel, as we're having this conversation, Israel obviously has expanded its [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  conflict to Lebanon beyond what it was already doing in this supposed tit for tat, tit for tat [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=252.48s)]
*  deescalation through escalation method that they were applying where they were responsible for 80% [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=259.68s)]
*  of the munitions being deployed in the, you know, the Lebanese Israeli border skirmishes that were [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=265.2s)]
*  taking place. They obviously did an act of terror that even the likes of Leon Panetta considered [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  to be an act of terror. And I feel like when you got, it's like Osama bin Laden being like, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=278.96s)]
*  that's terror dog. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, like you are the guy, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=283.2s)]
*  Like he knows what terror is, right? If he's saying his terror, I I'm going to go along with what he's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=288.8s)]
*  saying, or maybe he's woke. I don't know. And anti-Semitic who knows. So after that and the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=294.64s)]
*  broad positive reception from Western media and Western officials in general, Israel was like, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=301.68s)]
*  Oh hell yeah, let's keep doing what we're doing. It doesn't seem like anyone's saying, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=307.2s)]
*  anyone's telling us don't do it. And now they are resorting to carpet, Southern Lebanon and doing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=312.08s)]
*  the exact same, you know, anti propaganda that they applied. But this time they're, they just [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=320.56s)]
*  changed the, what comes after the huh? From two has Bola in Lebanon. I wanted to, I wanted to hear [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=327.68s)]
*  your guys' analysis on that as the foremost experts on American imperialism. I know you had a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=336.8s)]
*  conversation with the Chapo boys on it as well. It's okay if you repeat some of those talking [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=343.04s)]
*  points. It's all good. But how are you guys, how are you guys enjoying the show with Anthony [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=348.08s)]
*  Blinken defending Israel unconditionally? You know, I, how could it possibly be going better? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=353.52s)]
*  Is what I ask myself every day. No, I mean, I think that the only thing that you left out is that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  it now seems that, you know, the, the headlines in the, in Reuters and the associated press are [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  indications are that Israel is escalating its air attacks into a ground invasion. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=374.96s)]
*  They're calling up reserve battalions. You know, it still may not happen. It still might, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=381.68s)]
*  it can go either way still, but it's not trending in a good direction. At least, you know, in the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=387.2s)]
*  sense that it's, it's, it is just escalating. But Israel has never really successfully invaded [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  Lebanon without getting a bloody nose. So we'll see what happens there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=399.2s)]
*  Yeah. 2006 was the last time, right? And that did not, that was a huge, I mean, it was, it was [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=403.2s)]
*  humiliating. Oh, that was a big, big bad. You have to imagine that they're there as, as [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  unrestrained as they appear right now, they're going to have a much harder time going up against [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah than they have against, and the piece of territory that they have so much control over. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=420.88s)]
*  This would be a different, this would be a different story. I think now whether or not they are [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=427.28s)]
*  unhinged enough at this point to consider that I defer to you guys. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=431.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, what Hassan's putting up on the screen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=435.28s)]
*  Oh yeah. No, I was just, I was just showcasing the words Western media used to avoid saying ground [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=438.08s)]
*  invasion, use of ground troops, ground offensive, ground maneuver. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=442.96s)]
*  I will say, I think ground offensive is pretty fine. I think that that is more or less what an [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=447.12s)]
*  invasion like, like like it's, it's, it's offensive, you know, it's not mincing there. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=452.08s)]
*  I think the FT gets a pass from me on that one, but the rest of them [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=458.88s)]
*  have pretty good coverage on this stuff. I think from early October in general, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=461.52s)]
*  much better than wall street journal, which is in the tank and has routinely spread misinformation. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=469.12s)]
*  As a matter of fact, misinformation that like, if I recall correctly, the American state department [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=474.4s)]
*  had to come out and clarify in a brief act of unity from both the U S state department, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=480.56s)]
*  the Israeli government, the, the Israeli intelligence services, and even Iran. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=486.48s)]
*  If you remember when they were like, they all had to be like, yeah, we didn't know [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=492.72s)]
*  October 7 was happening. Like everybody had to be like, yeah, Iran did not play a role in October [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=496.48s)]
*  7 beyond like regular, you know, regular logistical support and training to like militants. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=501.52s)]
*  I mean, there, there is now, I think a quality of, I guess, like the, you know, the media at this [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=508.64s)]
*  stage of it is kind of, it's, it's sort of hard, I think, to communicate like why stuff is going on [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=515.76s)]
*  without just sort of like, like I've not read a story yet in a mainstream paper that doesn't [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=522.48s)]
*  like really kind of foreground that like Israel is choosing to escalate. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=528.8s)]
*  Like the facts of this situation are a lot harder to propagandize around, I think, than like the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=533.28s)]
*  post October 7 stuff was like rallying around the flag in this situation is like much more [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=539.84s)]
*  tortured and much less effective when Israel's going to war with like, you know, like a somewhat [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=545.36s)]
*  neutral country, you know, a neutral country truly, you know, I mean, and but is now like, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=550.88s)]
*  yeah, is somehow things that can have that front and the other one, it all doesn't really add up [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  to me truthfully as a, as a coherent set of operations. Yeah. So the question I have, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=562.16s)]
*  I guess, that that many people also have, and I want to hear a different perspective on this is [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  like, what the fuck is Israel thinking? Because as you also correctly pointed out, they've had an [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  incredibly hard time dealing with an ascetic resistance force that is basically in captured [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  territory that is under permanent Israeli mass surveillance and occupation. They can't deal with [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=586.0s)]
*  like 17 to like 20 year olds wearing Adidas track suits running up to their $30 million Markava [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=592.48s)]
*  tanks and lobbing grenades directly into it. How the fuck are they expected to deal with an enemy [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=599.04s)]
*  with a standing military that is combat trained, that is far better equipped, that is in an entirely [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=604.56s)]
*  sovereign state that has geared up as defenses against this potential Israeli invasion [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=612.88s)]
*  since the last two times that they successfully were able to withstand Israeli invasion. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  Noah has a lot more insight into the nitty gritty. I think we talked about this on [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=624.64s)]
*  Chapo the other day. Are you just saying that because I'm Jewish, right? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=630.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was insinuating. Okay, I just wanted to be clear. I just wanted to be on the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=635.68s)]
*  level here. No, I mean I follow this stuff but we sort of had a little back and forth the other [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=639.6s)]
*  day wondering about this very question. I mean I was sort of pointing out from my part that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=646.4s)]
*  I think there's an obvious problem at this point with saying that Israel is doing all of this [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=652.4s)]
*  as an obedient client state of the U.S. and only that. U.S. has a particular interest as we've [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  seen from every new hapless cable or dispatch that the State Department puts out saying, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=669.12s)]
*  we don't think it would be particularly constructive for them to go into Lebanon. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=675.44s)]
*  I don't think that's kayfabe. I think the U.S. is essentially handcuffed at this moment to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=679.04s)]
*  a rogue state that it has shrinking influence with and has had shrinking influence with over the years [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=686.96s)]
*  as a so-called client patron dynamic. Israel is operating unlike the Empire, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=692.16s)]
*  which wants goods to flow and commodities to ultimately go back and forth all over the world, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=698.24s)]
*  which is why the Houthis piss us off so much because they've been blocking some of that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=703.6s)]
*  Israel has a totally different logic I think at this point, which is that of a lunatic state in [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=707.44s)]
*  which, as you put it Noah the other day, the inmates are kind of taken over the asylum and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=713.76s)]
*  the colder logic of past years, which isn't to justify any of Israel's policies, it was still a [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=718.96s)]
*  relatively cold and considered logic of how to occupy and exploit and ultimately probably [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=725.52s)]
*  starve out this place, the occupied territories. It had those Shin Bet guys, the sort of old guard [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  that would say in the documentary like the Gatekeepers where they talk to a bunch of Shin Bet [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=741.84s)]
*  chiefs or former Shin Bet chiefs that say, yeah, we're basically fascist now, that's how it is. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=746.16s)]
*  We'll see how that works out. I think now, as Noah can obviously speak to, follow the kind of, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  he's got more of these stories that are in the news day in and day out, it seems like now [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=758.48s)]
*  this is an ethno state that has fully gone out of control and really has no choice in its own logic [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=765.36s)]
*  but to escalate, but to throw the war further on. And to, like other states that had a [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  attack dog approach toward their idea of greater Germany or greater Serbia and now greater Israel, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=780.16s)]
*  they have no choice but to expand. So that's to just outline a little bit the difference [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=786.4s)]
*  between what I can detect in Israel's calculus and the calculus of its benefactor, the United States. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know, what do you think Noah? I mean, we talked about this a couple days ago. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=797.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the only other thing I would really add to that, because I think you kind of hit all [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=801.0400000000001s)]
*  the major points, the only thing I would add is that there is something in, like a lot of what [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=804.32s)]
*  Israel and the Israeli leadership is doing is because of strong political incentives [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=810.24s)]
*  that are domestic in Israel, much in the same way that when you were like, why did the American [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  military or the American political leadership make such a puzzling decision in Iraq or Afghanistan, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=822.96s)]
*  at these various points, it's often because they're driven by domestic political considerations. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=828.0s)]
*  And Israel is no different. And in this case, the Netanyahu government since October 7, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=833.92s)]
*  they had a steep fall in popularity, but then they've only gradually gotten more popular since. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=839.92s)]
*  And the way in which that kind of escalation has sort of nourished them, it's kind of bailed them [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=844.4799999999999s)]
*  out of dealing with the problems that people were initially at first, you know, blush on October 7, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=850.56s)]
*  more aware of than at any point since. Because now what like the war with Hezbollah kind of staves [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=856.4799999999999s)]
*  off is what in a group, so the Israeli central bank, I forget what it's called, it may just be [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=863.28s)]
*  called that, an economist there recently published a report stating that like, look, if you sort of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=868.88s)]
*  buy the general line that they're going to try to wind down the general level of conflict over the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=877.04s)]
*  next year, during that time or at the end of it, Israel is going to have to engage in a program of [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=881.52s)]
*  radical austerity, or there is going to be a financial crisis. In fact, the financial crisis [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=887.36s)]
*  may be unavoidable without some sort of massive stabilization. I think that like truthfully, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=892.64s)]
*  I do think that there is the political appetite in the US government to help bail out Israel down [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=899.36s)]
*  the line. However, like, you know, when we are not, you know, like, that's a political problem that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=903.6s)]
*  these guys don't want to get to. And it satisfies this sort of Brendan laid out, like, what I would [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=909.12s)]
*  sort of think of are like these, the bigger ideological priors that they have that kind of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=913.76s)]
*  soup them up and get them excited and sort of legitimate their unbelievably stupid and short [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=918.56s)]
*  sighted decision to, you know, escalate now possibly to the point of a ground invasion [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=924.16s)]
*  with Lebanon, something that, again, historically does not go well for Israel. And it's not because [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=930.4799999999999s)]
*  like, you know, they didn't find they didn't hit like, you know, up, up, down, down, square, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  circle, triangle quick enough. It's like, it's not a battle. It's not a fight that favors them. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=940.2399999999999s)]
*  Brendan, you're a little blurry. Oh, yeah, I'm trying to come back. There we go. There he is. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=945.68s)]
*  Beautiful face. Yeah. I think I was listening to the New York Times daily report from that one, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=949.52s)]
*  like Israeli surveillance reporter, like the Israeli security national security reporter [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=956.4799999999999s)]
*  that they had on the daily that talked about like the increasing popularity that like the ultra [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  nationalist far right elements within Israeli society have had over the past like 30 years. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=971.68s)]
*  It was definitely a little bit of, it was definitely a little bit of like, oh no, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=976.88s)]
*  it's just like these guys are basically now running the country. And there is truth to that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=981.3599999999999s)]
*  The inmates are running the asylum. And I do routinely think about like the gravest threat to [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=987.76s)]
*  the Zionist operation being that all the academics and all the artists that make the EDM you've ever [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=994.08s)]
*  heard of inevitably leaving Israel because they just no longer consider, they no longer consider [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1005.36s)]
*  Israel to be a truly secure nation. Like the veil of the veil of security has was obviously damaged [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1013.44s)]
*  greatly in October seven, Israel retaliated in incredibly violent ways by conducting its [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1021.68s)]
*  affairs. But beyond that, ever since then, the Iron Dome has failed time and time again, including [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1028.08s)]
*  with, you know, who the loitering munitions and also a hypersonic missile coming directly from [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1034.48s)]
*  on Sir Allah. These are this constitutes a genuine threat to like normal Israeli society where they [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  can no longer operate under the veneer of like, we are a Western nation where, you know, nothing [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1048.16s)]
*  bad will happen to you. And we can be as violent as we want to everyone without any sort of [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1054.4s)]
*  repercussions to normal Israeli society. Like you can still go to the beach in Tel Aviv and party [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1060.48s)]
*  as we are conducting our, you know, mere miles away. And I think that that constitutes a grave [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1066.3200000000002s)]
*  threat because it will inevitably turn Israel into a nation that is entirely comprised of [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1073.2s)]
*  messianic inbred ultra-orthodox psychopaths with a nuclear arsenal and further push them away as a [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1081.52s)]
*  pariah state. Obviously that is terrifying for the future of the world, right? But it's also [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  terrifying for the Zionist project in general. And I think that's why a lot of these like shin [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1098.48s)]
*  bet guys regularly try to like speak out against that because they also want the maintenance of [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1103.2s)]
*  the apartheid to continue to a certain degree that is manageable in a way that does not disrupt the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1110.88s)]
*  regular order of business. And while, you know, they have recognized that they're slowly losing [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1116.8s)]
*  their grip on power, the thing that comes to mind, obviously like the former shin bed official that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1124.08s)]
*  told Benjamin and Yahoo, if you consistently, if you, if you continue these attacks on the West Bank, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1128.8000000000002s)]
*  like this is going to become an unmanageable situation. An October 7th style attack might [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1134.48s)]
*  happen. This was way before October 7th and Benjamin and now has a retaliation to that was [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  your woke. You've been captured by woke interests. And, and you know, that's what happens when you [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1145.2800000000002s)]
*  let a guy from Philadelphia be your leader, but big L on that one or Israel. Well, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1152.88s)]
*  well, we, we, we talked about this the other day too. You know, with regard to America, there's a, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1160.48s)]
*  there's a thesis from back in the day called the Yankee versus the cowboy. And I think you [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1166.24s)]
*  could apply that analysis to Israel as much as anywhere else, including America, where [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  you have divides in the ruling class. There are those Israelis in power who we were just [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1176.24s)]
*  describing who want to maintain their hegemony in the area. Maybe someday they hope Israel could [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1182.56s)]
*  take over more of the land officially, but for now it's okay to maintain it. Similar to the American [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1191.28s)]
*  during the cold war and beyond the American Eastern establishment who thought let's keep [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  Europe stable. Let's run NATO. Let's do containment and we'll get there versus the frontier types, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1205.52s)]
*  the yahoos, the cowboys who in the American example would be, you know, your, you know, your [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1213.1200000000001s)]
*  pro Vietnam China lobby types who wanted to take the cold war into Asia where they thought it was [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1220.8s)]
*  really going to cook and pop off, not worry about Europe, who they viewed as a bunch of, you know, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1226.64s)]
*  snobbish leeches of America. And in Israel the example would be exactly the crowd we've been [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1232.64s)]
*  talking about, the so-called inmates taking over the asylum who want the frontier to keep going, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1238.24s)]
*  the manifest destiny to keep going, not in a 50-year period, not in a 100-year period, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  but right now, today and tomorrow. And that's who, as Noah was pointing out, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1247.6000000000001s)]
*  that's who's taking over. And that's not necessarily a good thing for their fellow Zionists, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1253.8400000000001s)]
*  because it's short-sighted, it's unstrategic, and while it's horribly violent and a terrible [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1259.1999999999998s)]
*  thing for everyone else as well, it's ultimately kind of a death drive and suicidal. So the question [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1265.6799999999998s)]
*  will be if they, you know, exhaust themselves before they take everyone else out with them. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, you've got to imagine, not to get too grim, but you've got to imagine the U.S., [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1277.36s)]
*  you know, at some points for saying if we, let's say we do start to cut them off, are they going [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1281.6s)]
*  to start talking about tactical nukes or this or that, or are they crazy enough to make that [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1287.36s)]
*  threat and then actually press the button? You know, that's going to keep people up in [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1292.1599999999999s)]
*  the State Department in a way that is a bit of a hostage situation of its own. So I think that is [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1296.1599999999999s)]
*  the kind of dichotomy that we're seeing right now as far as the different groups trying to [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1302.24s)]
*  direct Israel's destiny at the expense of everyone else. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1308.8s)]
*  Yeah, also to further, I mean, to further prove the point that you're making, we saw this [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1312.0s)]
*  divergence within the State Department with those who want to maintain American hegemonic power [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1319.36s)]
*  status early on with calls for restraint towards Israel because they knew what Israel was going to [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1324.32s)]
*  do against those who were unconditional and undying Zionists themselves who truly believed [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1330.64s)]
*  that Israel must not be restrained and they should actually blow off a little bit of steam [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1339.52s)]
*  or even, like you said, manifest destiny in the way that they wanted to. And that's why you saw [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1344.24s)]
*  State Department officials resign and that's why you are now getting reports from ProPublica about [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1350.0s)]
*  even USAID and other State Department agencies creating memos all the way back, I believe, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1356.72s)]
*  in April and sending it to Anthony Blinken to be like, hey, Israel is actually in direct [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1365.44s)]
*  contradiction with American laws, the Lihi law to be exact. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1370.48s)]
*  Now, we should be fair here. We should be really fair because similar memos were drafted for when [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1374.72s)]
*  the State Department approved the arming of Saudi Arabia in their campaign against the Houthis. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1381.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1387.9199999999998s)]
*  So Hassan, Brendan, we cannot pick on the only Jewish state to get arms in contravention of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1388.24s)]
*  war crimes, statutes and laws. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1395.36s)]
*  Yes. And that would be wrong. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1397.4399999999998s)]
*  I was very much in support of the Saudi Kingdom continuous. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1399.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm watching your tropes. I'm watching your tropes. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1403.84s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for keeping me honest. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1406.56s)]
*  Yes, absolutely, man. It's crazy. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1410.7199999999998s)]
*  Okay, I'll do one. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1412.8s)]
*  You never know. Like, Jonathan Greenblatt, you know, just like that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1413.6s)]
*  I'll do one bagging you. It seems quite Islamophobic that you are coming after the Muslim [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1416.88s)]
*  nation of Saudi Arabia. That's where Mecca is. Okay. And Medina. You understand? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1422.88s)]
*  And Medina. And Medina. Not just Medina, but Medina as well. And you coming after the Muslim nation [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1428.88s)]
*  is quite Islamophobic. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1434.96s)]
*  Someone take a pot shot at Ireland or something so I can get in here and have a... [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1436.72s)]
*  Oh, now the potato farmer speaks up. Oh, boy. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1441.28s)]
*  Well, there you go. The Irish phobia is alive and well, folks. It's completely permissible. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1445.44s)]
*  You could just say that and get away with it. You know, it's up. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1453.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1456.88s)]
*  But okay, all jokes aside... [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1458.16s)]
*  One thing I do want to add on the point of like the sort of like how Israel is getting [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1459.84s)]
*  more radical and like what is its interest or whatever. A lot of it is that like Israel is [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1464.64s)]
*  already like it has been on sort of like years of decline in the way that like a lot of the [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1470.88s)]
*  West has broadly. Income inequality has widened. The economic... You know, it's basically like [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  there's like Poland is doing good, I guess, but like pretty much everyone else has been doing [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1483.3600000000001s)]
*  pretty bad. Although America's recovered. Yeah, right? Seriously, man. Like, you know, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1487.68s)]
*  next thing you know, we're going to be asking them to screw in our light bulbs. In any event. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1492.8000000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1497.76s)]
*  You know, like this... So Israel is not like immune from like this secular change, like bad [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1498.96s)]
*  change in condition in the financial and economic health of itself, the country. And you know, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1504.6399999999999s)]
*  it's also not really like it's quite clearly losing its edge as like an offensive military power. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1509.68s)]
*  They can do a lot of this, you know, they can blow up Pania, they can do the pager attack, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1516.48s)]
*  they have they clearly are willing to do these things as well. But like, you know, there is [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1521.12s)]
*  like it's not just crazies pulling the trigger on those things. I think that the crazies are [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1528.72s)]
*  gaining currency because they are being led in from the center in a sense, you know, I mean, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1533.84s)]
*  like, look, like, like the emergency powers essentially that Hitler had ready made for him [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1539.84s)]
*  when he assumed power were there because Groening, you know, had them, you know, more or less had them [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1544.96s)]
*  as part of like, you know, like Twilight of the Weimar government. I don't, again, like I don't [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1550.72s)]
*  want to be in the habit of making like one to one history of Nazi Germany history of Israel [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1555.6000000000001s)]
*  comparisons, but like, that seems to me to be... Yeah, among many other points of comparison. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1560.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's why it's always funny when... All right, go ahead, Brandon, sorry. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1567.76s)]
*  I was just gonna say, I mean, I mean, that's another way that you can look at, you know, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1571.84s)]
*  like a dichotomy is that Israel has always done shenanigans like this, blowing up a bunch of [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1577.92s)]
*  people, assassinations of civilians. They've done that in the past. I mean, they spy on Americans [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1583.52s)]
*  and, you know, the liberty and all of that. There's a long history of all this, but they've always [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1588.8000000000002s)]
*  been very... Their perception in the world, particularly within America, has allowed that [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1594.72s)]
*  those rogue practices to be juxtaposed with a very well-run PR machine in which they run a tight ship [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1602.4s)]
*  and they have good message discipline and they know their way of messaging and public relations. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1610.8000000000002s)]
*  And that's the whole side of it, which has allowed the rogue acts and the assassinations and wars and [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1616.5600000000002s)]
*  all that to have this sheen to them that Americans, as an important audience, swallow very easily. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1624.8000000000002s)]
*  But now, I don't know what... Noah, Hassan, you could maybe tell me, but I don't know what's happened, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1630.8s)]
*  but they have lost that polished PR machine. They are now dealing every day with images and video, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1637.2s)]
*  not only of politicians saying grotesque things and, you know, rape advocates being, you know, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1648.56s)]
*  the Forrest Gumps that get to go on TV and, like, you know, be mascots, essentially, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1655.92s)]
*  on talk shows and stuff like that, but also videos from the battlefield, if you want to call it that, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1661.68s)]
*  in which the soldiers are doing war crimes in plain view. I mean, that is not... [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1668.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, I'll actually add to that and then kick it to Hassan, because I think there's, like, a question [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1674.64s)]
*  we can put to him there on that, which is that, like, you know, I... Because I agree with Brendan, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1680.48s)]
*  you know, Abba Eben, who is sort of like the OG effective Anglo-Lake language Israel diplomat of, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1685.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, my parents' generation, who was, you know, very charming, had, you know, very, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1692.32s)]
*  very good for television and so on. He's, you know, like, Ailon Levy, you know, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1696.7199999999998s)]
*  pales in comparison to somebody like him and so on. You know, that is, like, a thing of the past. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1701.76s)]
*  I think now that the reason that they don't give it about that sort of, like, deluge of imagery [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1708.48s)]
*  and the sort of, like, how horrible their advocates are now, the sort of loomerification [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1715.2s)]
*  of, like, all of, you know, like, the Zionists or whatever, I think that it's because it's, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1720.8s)]
*  you know, it follows, like, it fits, like, broad patterns of political polarization, you know, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1726.32s)]
*  along gender, along generational lines, especially, class, etc. Like, it's becoming, you know, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1730.72s)]
*  it's mapping onto, you know, broadly speaking, like, the left-right dichotomy. Not everything [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1738.08s)]
*  falls, you know, like, not all parts of it, but it does seem to me, like, it conforms to that, like, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1742.3999999999999s)]
*  pretty epically. That said, Hassan, like, it does seem, though, that, like, there are a bunch of [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1747.84s)]
*  influencers or people, like, oh, yeah, like, that guy, Ethan Klein, like, he shared a screenshot of [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1752.24s)]
*  a screenshot of a screenshot of something I said, which I love when that happens, and, like, but, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1760.48s)]
*  like, you know, he's, like, somebody who's, like, okay, clearly he has, like, an audience of, like, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1766.24s)]
*  people on the internet or whatever, but he's also, like, a very big pro-Israel moron. And, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1769.28s)]
*  like, clearly, like, there is, like, some, like, novel development in, like, you know, how certain [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1775.2s)]
*  people are, like, effective pro-Israel advocates now representing that viewpoint from, like, a [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1780.48s)]
*  younger generation, but, like, you know, who are, like, achieving something even if they don't have [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1784.96s)]
*  the finesse of, like, you know, earlier folks or whatever. I don't think Ethan Klein's audience is [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1790.48s)]
*  as, as, as even remotely seemingly pro-Israel as he is. That's my assessment, which is why he's [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1795.84s)]
*  constantly duking it out with his own audience or with regular frequency on this issue. But as, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1803.44s)]
*  as far as, like, what has changed, I think a couple of things, like, obviously a pivotal point was [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1809.6s)]
*  2021 when a lot of the NGOs that I normally am somewhat critical of openly declared Israel to [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1814.96s)]
*  be an apartheid, which took away, like, a massive cynical deployment of anti-Semitism whenever you [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1821.68s)]
*  brought this thing up, right? Because you could be like, well, these are institutions that, like, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1829.1200000000001s)]
*  are formative in the rule-based international order, and they are all also correctly calling [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1832.8s)]
*  Israel an apartheid regime. And I think ever since then, with also social media and the fact that [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1838.48s)]
*  people can, like, actually humanize Palestinians and directly hear from them, the dynamic has [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1846.4s)]
*  changed quite a bit because of that democratization of information spreading and not being completely [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1852.64s)]
*  captive to mainstream outlets that will repeat the State Department line unconditionally and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1860.8000000000002s)]
*  vociferously. A lot of people have been able to make up their own minds about what they see as, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1867.8400000000001s)]
*  like, truly a bloody and barbaric affair. I think that is also, that plays a major role. But beyond [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1873.2s)]
*  that, I think that the complacency that Israel has with many, many years of, like, complete, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1881.3600000000001s)]
*  like, unconditional support that Israel gets from mainstream media has, I think, it caused them to [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1892.16s)]
*  miss a step a little bit. Like you're now seeing operations being launched online. You, every now [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1898.64s)]
*  and then you'll see like a, you know, pro trans black former vet Christian come out and be like, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1905.44s)]
*  y'all not going to do this right now with, you know, the, what was it? I think Crank T. Nelson [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1914.64s)]
*  had the tweet. I got to pull it up real quick to show you, but it was like, it was such a ridiculous [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1920.24s)]
*  and so obviously like a, like a guess, like this makes like Russian attempts look brilliant in [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1925.04s)]
*  comparison here. This is the one I'm thinking of. Like watermelon. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1931.6s)]
*  Again, these wannabes nail emoji, nail emoji, nail emoji. And, and it's just like, when you look at [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1939.68s)]
*  the account, it's like black trans lives at truly be truly free, trans pride flag, black trans pride [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1946.72s)]
*  worldwide. Jesus is the way and the truth. Veteran. I don't even know what the AP is that a [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1954.88s)]
*  nurse thing. What's on? What does your chat say? What's APR and MSN mean? I have no idea. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1962.88s)]
*  Veteran to earn respect. You must learn respect joined may 2024. It's like, like, come on. And [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1968.4s)]
*  it's also, wait, hold on, go to the profile picture. Go to the, yeah, that's it. Yeah. It's, yeah. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1975.6000000000001s)]
*  It's filled in. It's looks like it's like, it's like, it's incompletely filled in. Yeah. Look [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1981.1200000000001s)]
*  at the Israeli flag shirt that she's wearing. Also look at how like, it's like the, all the, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1985.6000000000001s)]
*  like the background. It looks like you're like, it like, like drunk and in Tunis. It looks like, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1991.5200000000002s)]
*  yeah. So, I mean, this is this right here. Like if this is your attempt of, of, you know, causing [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=1996.88s)]
*  some kind of instability amongst the, the normal groups that are like advocates for pro advocates [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2004.88s)]
*  for Palestinian emancipation, like this is a horrifyingly bad job. Like you are not carrying [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2012.0s)]
*  out a good operation here at all. Right. And there's many such examples of this, like, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2017.6000000000001s)]
*  and I think it's, it's a, it comes from a place of complacency in many respects. I think like Israel [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  saw what happened to apartheid South Africa and learned all the lessons of what not to do and [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2028.8000000000002s)]
*  greatly increased. It's like greatly increased its, its operations in, in ensuring that America [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2033.9199999999998s)]
*  always maintain a positive attitude towards Israel. But I think they got a little too comfortable in [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2040.6399999999999s)]
*  that and didn't recognize that like in, in the new age of information with the internet, you can't [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2045.76s)]
*  really get away with all the, all the blood lusts, no matter how hard, you know, no matter how hard [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2053.6s)]
*  you try. I agree with that. And I'd also add that like they, something else that like definitely [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2058.4s)]
*  changed was the, like, there, like, there is like a sort of like, you know, downward linear [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2063.76s)]
*  level of like appreciation and identity that like the average, like where the median American has [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2071.44s)]
*  with the state of Israel. And you could sort of think of it as like the apex was when Paul [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2077.04s)]
*  Newman starred in the movie Exodus in like the 1950s or 60s. And then, but you know, ever since [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2081.2s)]
*  then, it's been sort of like progressively downhill as people see like Israel's true nature [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2089.12s)]
*  revealed time and time and time again. You know, and it's obviously uneven, but that, and like, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2093.9199999999996s)]
*  I think there may have actually been a pro-Israel peak in the 1980s, but like broadly speaking, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2098.8799999999997s)]
*  when we look at like now the history, like through the 2020s, we see that it's this big downhill [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2103.7599999999998s)]
*  thing. And, you know, there is like, you can't, you know, you can't outrun that. Like it's, it's, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2108.64s)]
*  it's, it's coming. It was a change, you know, bound up in generations and that was always going to [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2115.04s)]
*  make this kind of level of advocacy really difficult the next time. In fact, you know, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2120.8799999999997s)]
*  by the way, like Israel's committed an unprecedented slaughter and they've committed this [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2125.7599999999998s)]
*  unprecedented slaughter at a time when like everybody has a camera attached to themselves, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2129.92s)]
*  you know, like it's, there is just like a, this is what it means to be pro-Israel in 2024. And [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2134.48s)]
*  there was no amount of spin or nothing that like, you know, in the discourse, sub pursuant to Israeli [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2141.68s)]
*  actions that is, you know, really, you know, could be that different because the actions are now, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2147.2s)]
*  like it's, it's the whole, the whole thing is the whole landscape's different. It's all done [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2152.88s)]
*  changed. I'll give you a domestic example for those in the audience to understand a little bit [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2156.88s)]
*  better. I often talk about the Republican party refusing to run a normal campaign and their [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2161.12s)]
*  complete inability to do so. Right. They have hug box themselves into believing that like everybody [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2166.24s)]
*  cares about only trans people. And they always want to think about like children's genitals. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2172.96s)]
*  Right. And that kind of trans panic and crime panic narratives actually cost them the midterm [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2178.48s)]
*  election successes that they were supposed to get under a Biden administration where Americans were [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2184.96s)]
*  experiencing negative real wage growth. Like at that time, it should have been the Republican party [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2189.92s)]
*  wiping the table, but they got so comfortable and so insane that they put up like dog. Most [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2195.2000000000003s)]
*  triano, for example, like a Q and on guy as the governor of Pennsylvania, they brought forward [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2200.32s)]
*  Herschel Walker and a lot of people single out Donald Trump, but I think this is the entire [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2206.16s)]
*  Republican party. So hyper focused on culture war narratives that they, they end up coming across [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2210.96s)]
*  as truly repulsive to like normal people that aren't as invested in those narratives. And I [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2218.4s)]
*  think a similar thing can be said about Israel in the sense that like they legitimately think [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2223.2000000000003s)]
*  everybody thinks in the way that they do all the way from the most quote unquote woke liberal [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2227.76s)]
*  Zionist down to the the settler in Hebron spitting on the nuns. Israeli society has been hug boxed [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2234.48s)]
*  and echo chambered into thinking that like when they say, oh, we are going to call their children. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2243.12s)]
*  And when like an American hits the translate from Hebrew button, they're going to look at that and [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2249.44s)]
*  go, yeah, no, they're doing the right thing. I'm on board. I'm invested. I'm just as invested in [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2253.84s)]
*  this project as you are. They don't, they think it's weird. There's also like obviously resilient [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2259.04s)]
*  underlying anti-Semitism at play here as well, both from the ultra nationalist and pro Israel [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2265.2799999999997s)]
*  contingency like the evangelical Christians who will be like, Israel must be defended because [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2272.4s)]
*  they're God's chosen sons. And also, while simultaneously the same breath repeat things [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2277.6800000000003s)]
*  like they have horns and tails, and are the magic money people down to well, it's I mean, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2282.8s)]
*  it's a classic case of like, how like, if they're like all these like correct Jews who are like [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2288.88s)]
*  these perfected little humans who live over there, like, well, you know, we've got all these surplus, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2293.52s)]
*  you know, Jews who, as Trump said, are going to be the reason he loses the election. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2299.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing I feel there's nothing that makes me feel more secure than like a really, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2305.68s)]
*  really, really like pro Israel guy in Kentucky who didn't meet a Jewish person until he was 28. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2311.52s)]
*  Yeah. But beyond that, beyond that, anti-Semitism is like a underlying, like, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2317.04s)]
*  Felix brought up this point when he was on the broadcast, and I completely agree with him, like, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2324.32s)]
*  let's say you grew up in like Omaha, Nebraska, you've never met a Jewish person ever, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2329.52s)]
*  but you have consistently heard the narrative in normal conversations, right? Because a lot of [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2334.16s)]
*  people do like, secretly believe this, where they're like, you know, there are a lot of wealthy [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2340.16s)]
*  Jews in media and in positions of power, and there's not a lot of Jews in general, like when [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2346.16s)]
*  you have that underlying attitude, and then you see what's going on, okay, and then you entirety [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2350.8s)]
*  of Congress get up and deliver a standing ovation to Benjamin Netanyahu, as he's like talking about [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2357.44s)]
*  how there are college campus terrorists out there that are backed by, like, what are you supposed to [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2363.12s)]
*  think? You know what I mean? Like, this is how anti-Semitism festers and grows, like real anti-Semitism, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2368.8s)]
*  not ADL that I'm talking about. Like, the old, I mean, as of 10 or 15 years ago, I remember there [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2375.44s)]
*  was the, what, the Mearsheimer-Waltz book, the lobby, right, the Israel lobby. Yeah, that was [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2383.44s)]
*  18 years ago. Yeah, that was controversial. It was, you know, that's what got you really in trouble, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2390.4s)]
*  you know, back then, was to insinuate that this was a well-organized political movement within [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2397.12s)]
*  the United States working on behalf of a country that is literally in its political committee's [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2403.68s)]
*  name. But if you start, and of course people can go overboard with that and what they really mean [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2408.96s)]
*  is the secret lizard cabal or whatever, and you know, we all know what we think of that. But to deny [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2416.8s)]
*  a clinical treatment that you would give the China lobby, the Cuba lobby, any other one of [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2424.0s)]
*  these organized political movements for the benefit of another country within America to make sure it [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2430.0s)]
*  continues to get support. And you try to drum that out of the, like, polite discourse or reasonable [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2436.64s)]
*  discourse. You try to completely bury that. And then, and Yahoo! goes up and gets nonstop applause [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2443.44s)]
*  and Israel gets blank checks, do whatever it wants. As you said, Asan, people are going to [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2448.8799999999997s)]
*  actually resort to actual antisemitic theories and the galaxy of websites that are dealing in [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2453.92s)]
*  crackpot nonsense instead of looking at perhaps unpleasant but nasty realities [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2461.92s)]
*  in the American-Israeli relationship that are worth discussing and that can be looked at [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2470.64s)]
*  and written about and debated. And I remember it was just like you could get in real trouble [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2477.12s)]
*  back then if you even talked about AIPAC as a factor at all. I was young, but you could see it. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2483.04s)]
*  You know, we're gonna yell that by the Democratic Party as well as like the entire media apparatus [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2488.32s)]
*  for saying it's all about the Benjamin's baby. And they're like, what do you mean, Benjamin? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2494.08s)]
*  It's a Jewish name or whatever they were saying at the time. Or they're saying, oh, you mean [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2499.92s)]
*  money Jews are puppeteering the American government? It's like, no, she's talking about AIPAC. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2504.08s)]
*  It's very obvious she's talking about lobbying. Okay. Which gives the money not because it has [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2509.12s)]
*  any effect, but because they just love politicians. Yeah. Yeah. It's just so stupid to like not [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2514.32s)]
*  realize that one, marrying Israel's actions to Judaism as a defensive posture is unironically [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2523.28s)]
*  going to cause people to look at that and go, well, I have no critical thinking, but these guys are [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2532.2400000000002s)]
*  saying they're doing it for Judaism. And those who are defending the guys that are saying they're [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2537.6000000000004s)]
*  doing it for Judaism are also saying you're anti-Semitic. So I guess this is something that [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2542.24s)]
*  Jews want universally. And that's why like you brought up the Trump anti-Semitism conference [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2547.2799999999997s)]
*  earlier. I thought it was very instructive on both what the media chose to cover from that [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2552.3999999999996s)]
*  conference and what they chose to omit. Donald Trump very clearly in that conference said, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2560.56s)]
*  you didn't even ask for it. And I gave it to you because you gave me money. And he named [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2566.56s)]
*  Sheldon and Miriam Adelson in that conference. And then he also spoke about like, he also spoke [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2573.92s)]
*  about this idea that like, again, this false notion that like all Jews as a monolithic force [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2581.12s)]
*  only care about Israel because he kept repeating that. He was like, I gave you all the that you [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2587.76s)]
*  want. What more do you offer me? What the aren't you voting for me? What's wrong with you? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2592.0s)]
*  That was the main through line there. And if you are on a Monday defending the notion that all Jews [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2595.68s)]
*  care about Israel, you're not going to be able to cover that with the, you know, with the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2601.52s)]
*  adequate tools necessary to be like, no, that's anti-Semitic. It's not just anti-Semitic when a [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2607.52s)]
*  Nazi says it. It's anti-Semitic when those who are pro-Israel are saying that as well, even if [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2612.48s)]
*  they're cynically using it as a defensive shield. And now with the whole, I haven't followed it [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2617.2s)]
*  closely, but the slander from CNN, Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, I think much like the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2622.08s)]
*  Israeli, you know, charm offensive is not what it used to be. Americans who probably like American [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2630.16s)]
*  media figures who probably would have gotten away with something like this not so long ago. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2637.7599999999998s)]
*  It seems like now there is a genuine pushback that makes it to their desk where they have to [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2645.52s)]
*  weasel out of it. As I believe Bash did yesterday, she didn't issue a correction, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2651.44s)]
*  which is what she, the word she should have used, but she issued a clarification, I think she said [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2656.88s)]
*  about Rashida Tlaib and her remarks that they tried to paint as anti-Semitic. And again, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2661.76s)]
*  it wasn't so long ago that would have been the end of it, but people just aren't buying that anymore. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2669.04s)]
*  And that's a big problem, obviously. That one was like a little bit of like a sort of like perfect [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2672.64s)]
*  storm of like, they made up a lie. The guy who like they made up the smear about to leave, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2678.4s)]
*  the guy who was the interviewer who was supposedly a part of it, like, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2685.28s)]
*  declaimed it immediately. And they still ran with it. Like that one was like a full, like that was [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2689.28s)]
*  to me a sort of illustration of like how they have to bend over to give it to their natural affinities [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2695.6s)]
*  in ways that they didn't, you know, it used to be a little bit more subtle, or it was, you know, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2702.0s)]
*  I mean, I mean, now it even they, I'm kind of surprised at the very least that like, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2706.08s)]
*  they even got an apology out of it, even from Jonathan Greenblatt. But I guess that one really [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2711.04s)]
*  was that egregious. One other thing that also to me with this stuff is that the like real anti-Semitism, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2715.6s)]
*  to me, like the idea of like people who like, want to like, you know, like who dislike Jews [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2722.72s)]
*  and dislike what they perceive to be Jewish influence and stuff. Like I do, it does sort [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2728.72s)]
*  of mean that there is like a now like, you know, the JD Vance stuff has also felt like a sort of [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2735.92s)]
*  degree like, oh, like, well, those people now do have like a home as part of like the latent [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  Republican Party. And so as things deteriorate in the Middle East, like now those people have [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2745.6s)]
*  a platform and a soapbox so much to stand that they didn't before, you know, perfectly conveniently [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2751.44s)]
*  timed for like the single most anti-Semitic thing that's ever about to happen outside of the [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2756.2400000000002s)]
*  Holocaust. I guess the final question before we move on to the Khmer Rouge and your latest series [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2761.36s)]
*  is the question that I hear all the time and I give answers to all the time, which is like, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2772.0s)]
*  why is America so committed to Israel? Sorry. Why is America so committed to Israel? What are your [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2778.96s)]
*  opinions on it? This is sort of what kicked off our discussion the other day with on [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2786.2400000000002s)]
*  Chopo is, you know, you probably discussed this on your show many times. I mean, you have a period [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2791.3599999999997s)]
*  of history where America really wasn't, did not have this special relationship at all. I don't [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2798.8799999999997s)]
*  know if you would disagree, Noah, but I mean, we really cemented with Kissinger and Nixon, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2804.24s)]
*  funnily enough, our most anti-Semitic president on record, at least. Oh, yeah, he's like Israel's [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2808.08s)]
*  basically fate kind of hangs in the balance in the Yom Kippur and it really rides on whether or not, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2814.24s)]
*  America is going to rearm Israel and Kissinger says, do it and they do it and, you know, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2819.84s)]
*  and forever after, you know, we were bound together. It was a cold war. It was like many, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2824.96s)]
*  if not all factors of American foreign policy at that moment. It was a cold maneuver, given that [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2830.88s)]
*  the Arab states were all predisposed to either live with or be friendly with the Soviet bloc. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2836.32s)]
*  But at any rate, in 2024, my little case that I laid out with Chopo guys was that the relationship [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2844.32s)]
*  is disintegrating. Whether it will completely fall apart, I don't know. It's, of course, hard [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2851.6000000000004s)]
*  to imagine that given what we've all, people of our age have grown up with, but it is disintegrating [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2856.4s)]
*  for reasons we've discussed on here today. However, America's power is waning. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2862.2400000000002s)]
*  CENTCOM is in the Middle East. It's an incredibly important part of the, you know, big chain of [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2869.2s)]
*  military bases and the apparatus that more than economics or political power at this point is what [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2875.2799999999997s)]
*  keeps our machine humming as an empire. And we have to ironically get more and more humiliated [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2884.64s)]
*  by this ally in order to tell ourselves that it's good that we even still have an ally there in the [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2894.32s)]
*  first place, because everywhere else you look, it's slipping away. And China's doing a lot more [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2902.96s)]
*  by way of business and persuasion and out wheeling and dealing the capitalist point men in the world. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2909.2000000000003s)]
*  So I think that the reason at this current moment why we're still so attached at the hip [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2922.0s)]
*  is actually one of desperation and ultimate confusion and incoherence, given that it's a [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2928.32s)]
*  moment of deterioration between what used to be America's lock on the Middle East and what is [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2933.44s)]
*  coming next, which is a question mark for us. I agree with Brendan a lot on that, that like [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2943.04s)]
*  it is sort of the incoherence, this is not a moment in which like, you know, in existing order [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2949.04s)]
*  is reasserting itself with might and vigor and revealing to us, you know, like the ley lines of [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2957.7599999999998s)]
*  the global power sphere or whatever. It's far from that. In fact, like we're seeing things kind of, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2963.68s)]
*  you know, to use Brendan's word, things fall apart. And it's not that there is like in this [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2969.6s)]
*  bipolar world, like somebody else trying to immediately fill the void. It's that things, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2975.12s)]
*  you know, are resisting being a part of like this neat sphere of influence that we've carved out for [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2981.52s)]
*  ourselves. And, you know, it's not like the, which is not to say that like Gaza is a flame, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2987.04s)]
*  because they're part of the, you know, like JD punch and Chinese anti US order or something like [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2991.8399999999997s)]
*  that. But that like, all of this are, you know, these are different symptoms in their own way [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=2997.2799999999997s)]
*  of like the same kind of, again, you know, like decline, rot, the ability to unproductively manage [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3002.72s)]
*  these really core relationships that underpin the American power system around the world. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3009.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's no defense of Israel. Sorry, it's no defense of American statecraft or America [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3015.52s)]
*  in general to say that I don't think they share the goals that Israel share, that Israel has in [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3022.3999999999996s)]
*  Gaza. I think it's just a fact of the matter that they are for their own reasons, more opposed [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3028.96s)]
*  toward rocking the boat with this fragile yet still existent ally ship, however, increasingly [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3037.92s)]
*  unstrategic it is, then the alternative. And that they would probably prefer this ship over because [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3044.48s)]
*  there's an election in a month and a half. But that it's not something willing to risk in the long term, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3051.2s)]
*  because as I said earlier, things are cracking up and they need to take their friends, however, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3058.48s)]
*  duplicitous, take their friends where they can find them for now. Yeah, I think they can also [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3064.4s)]
*  trust Israel, I guess, given, I mean, in spite of all of the like counter espionage that Israel's [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3068.64s)]
*  committed against America, or even like the USS Liberty incident, like you mentioned, they still [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3075.84s)]
*  have this attitude where they feel like they can trust Israel more than they can with even like [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3081.84s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, which at times will go against America's interest with OPEC plus they can [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3086.48s)]
*  Israel seemingly from their calculation, I talked about this earlier today is like more stable as a [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3093.6800000000003s)]
*  reliable ally than even a country like Egypt, which is a client state, but a client state that [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3100.32s)]
*  still has an active majority, almost entirely Muslim population that can sometimes overthrow [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3104.88s)]
*  their puppet leadership, the American puppet leadership. And that's like a risk that they're [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3113.68s)]
*  not willing to take in the same way that they can have a guy who may or may not have been, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3117.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, definitely was Masad, but may or may not have also been a CIA asset at a certain point, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3124.24s)]
*  be the prime minister. Like there is a level of assurance that you have with Israel at the end of [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3129.8399999999997s)]
*  the day, being a willing party to American hegemonic power in the region, because at the end, they will [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3136.3999999999996s)]
*  tell you, are they going to go get weapons from China and Russia? Like would that be able to carry [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3142.96s)]
*  them across any finish line? Of course not. No, we brought that up the other day too. And, you know, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3148.64s)]
*  Felix pointed out Russia can't even take Kiev, you know, it's not going to be able to fill [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3154.4s)]
*  the role of America. But I do think that, you know, 50 years from now, things could look very [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3160.88s)]
*  different. In Israel, you could imagine a scenario where they go full pariah and take what they can [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3168.08s)]
*  get from everybody rather than just have this uniquely profitable relationship with America, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3173.6s)]
*  depending on the breaks. But for now, I think everyone, however suspicious they are of each [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3179.12s)]
*  other, however resentful they are of each other, they still want to preserve an antiquated, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3185.04s)]
*  ultimately cold alliance that has, you know, fallen out of kind of historical meaning at this [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3190.16s)]
*  point in time. Especially when considering the complicated relationship that Israel has with [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3198.7999999999997s)]
*  Russia in general as well. I mean, there are a ton of Russian nationals that are now Israeli, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3206.16s)]
*  some of which aren't even Jewish, but they're just Israeli. And that is the reason why, you know, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3213.36s)]
*  the pro-Israel, pro-Russia contingency is not exclusive to the mega Republicans that got duped [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3222.4s)]
*  by like a telegram channel. And also to your point about like Israel and Russia's relationship, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3229.6s)]
*  Israel has a relationship with Ukraine as well. And there's lots of Ukrainian nationals in Israel, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3234.88s)]
*  including, you know, rumor has it, you know, members of Zelensky's family. Like, I think that [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3239.36s)]
*  the idea is that Israel, you know, in the same way that like Istanbul is considered sort of a neutral [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3243.76s)]
*  ground for the wealthy and the bourgeois of, you know, both sides of like the Saudi Iran, like, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3249.36s)]
*  like divide for the 2010s. You know, it's the one place in the region where you can catch a flight [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3256.32s)]
*  to like pretty much any city. I think that you, yeah, you could, you could make the, oh, sorry. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3262.72s)]
*  Mike's coming in a bit hot. Yeah. I think I'm sorry. I forgot what the comparison, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3270.56s)]
*  but the point of comparison is Istanbul. And you activated my flight or my fighter flight. And [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3275.04s)]
*  bringing up Turkey by bringing up Turkey, Turkish president Adnan. I don't approach a mosque as an [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3282.72s)]
*  organization. Turkish president Adnan also gave a us speech where he compared Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3287.44s)]
*  to Adolf and demanded the Western powers take action as they did during world two yesterday. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3292.8s)]
*  My woke, my woke King Rajiv Thai about it on Mr. NATO. I mean, he's yeah, he plays every the [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3299.44s)]
*  watermelon, the watermelon seller plays every side of it. Yeah. He's playing, you come on on top. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3306.2400000000002s)]
*  He's he's he's, I mean, he has a lot of internal pressure, but this is what happens when you have [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3313.12s)]
*  allegiances with majority Muslim nations. That is like a perfect demonstration, right? You have a [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3318.7999999999997s)]
*  lot of internal pressure from your constituents that are like looking at the situation and going, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3325.2s)]
*  what the are you saying? I covered this extensively in the beginning, early October, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3330.96s)]
*  Rajiv Thai about Don was somewhat pro-Israel. As a matter of fact, a lot of the ultra nationalist [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3337.44s)]
*  anti-Ardogan constituencies in Turkey were also pro-Israel because of their overwhelming hatred [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3343.76s)]
*  for the Syrian refugees that now live in Israel, the ultra nationalists, I mean, but they, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3350.96s)]
*  strategic alliance with the Israelis, even though you hate their guts, it's like a Middle Eastern [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3359.44s)]
*  pastime. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And, and you know, we train in Turkey, Israeli fighter pilots. So [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3363.84s)]
*  that has never, that has never changed. So, and also we, the Turkish government is obviously in [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3372.96s)]
*  allegiance with Azerbaijan, which got most of their weapons from Israel when they were conducting [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3379.6800000000003s)]
*  their ethnic displacement campaign in Karabakh. And beyond that, obviously Israeli energy flows [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3385.92s)]
*  from Azerbaijan through Turkish pipelines directly into Israel, which comprises, I think like [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3394.08s)]
*  40% of their entire energy grid is Israel. Israel licenses weapons and works with everybody from [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3399.6800000000003s)]
*  Vietnam to China, you know, two countries that also have a rivalry, by the way. I think that one of [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3406.96s)]
*  the things that like globalization and really like we're talking about this sort of like historical [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3412.64s)]
*  period beginning in like 1980 or so. So for like the last 45 years, more or less, you have had a [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3417.52s)]
*  period by which everything got like more interconnected. There's still conflict. Yes. But like the economic [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3423.2799999999997s)]
*  ties that bind a lot of these countries have made open conflict that much harder and people who could [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3428.7999999999997s)]
*  be isolated and removed from and picked off by sanctions regimes like Saddam Hussein, you know, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3434.56s)]
*  or obviously attempts on Cuba and North Korea, you know, they'll try that. But in general, like [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3440.08s)]
*  it is a very difficult thing to do. And that's, you know, it's a testament to Israel's unique, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3445.84s)]
*  the unique like, like the unique, like, you know, cult, like mania that they're gripped by at this [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3452.0s)]
*  moment, that they're kind of, you know, you know, like they're speed running the demolition of all [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3457.84s)]
*  that they're removing all of the complexity that has protected them for the last 44 years on top [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3463.84s)]
*  of the strategic assurances given by the US. And they're just dynamiting it with, you know, like [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3468.48s)]
*  this, you know, like really radically, you know, like, like even by their standards, you know, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3473.36s)]
*  like the most violence that they have dealt probably in half a century, you know, we are, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3478.32s)]
*  we are now talking about it over the course of a year, you know, historically significant shit. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3483.36s)]
*  And they've lost, I just said no, this clip before we went on, they've lost their ability ultimately [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3489.6s)]
*  to deal out this type of violence while preserving somehow a respectable sheen on the international [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3495.8399999999997s)]
*  stage, at least among the nations that it matters to them. There was an interview, I don't know who [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3507.52s)]
*  the guy was, he was someone, some Israeli government spokesman who was being interviewed by some [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3513.12s)]
*  British journalist. And the journalist just said, what gives Israel the justification to have nukes [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3519.36s)]
*  and not Iran, especially in this day and age? And the guy just said like, well, I find the question [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3527.36s)]
*  offensive. And the journalist is like, well, I'm still going to ask it. And the guy was clearly just [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3532.96s)]
*  terrified and confused as to how the interview had been allowed to proceed to this moment. And he [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3539.6800000000003s)]
*  said, well, I mean, you know, and he said, we, you know, we have the right to nukes, we already [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3544.88s)]
*  survived, you know, a Holocaust. And the British journalist just said, so you're saying that the [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3550.56s)]
*  reason you deserve nukes is because the Holocaust happened. And he says, you know, this interview is [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3555.04s)]
*  over. And it's just, you could at one point probably have expected that to work. And now, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3560.88s)]
*  I'm not saying the media doesn't run interference, different sections, depending on, you know, what, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3569.76s)]
*  what country, what media organization, there's a lot of interference still being run for Israel, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3574.16s)]
*  but not as much. And it makes a big difference. And I think that in and of itself is a sign of [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3579.3599999999997s)]
*  where things are going. Yeah. I mean, they can't, yeah, they can't maintain this posture as though [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3585.12s)]
*  they are a moral nation and a democracy when like, even the, the international organs of justice [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3590.48s)]
*  are all screaming like, yes, these are feckless institutions, but they play a very important role [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3599.2s)]
*  in maintaining American soft power around the globe. Your calls, your calls to action against Russia [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3605.2s)]
*  ring hollow if you are packaging that immediately in the same timeframe as like your unconditional [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3612.16s)]
*  defense and loyalty to Israel. It just doesn't work. And if your soft power doesn't work, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3618.56s)]
*  and this is another point I brought up yesterday, your hard power capabilities diminish because all [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3623.28s)]
*  of a sudden now, if you don't have soft power, your 800 military bases around the world in 80 nations [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3629.76s)]
*  is now a military occupation. It's no longer a military ownership agreement. It all of a sudden [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3637.6800000000003s)]
*  can very quickly turn into a military occupation and 800 military bases around the world. You [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3643.36s)]
*  cannot defend that with a militant posture. And the more people feel like there is another [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3649.44s)]
*  counterbalance out there, another superpower out there that they can lean on like China, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3659.2000000000003s)]
*  the more they will take action against American dominance of this sort. And I think that there [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3664.0s)]
*  are plenty who see this in the state department. And that is probably the reason why, not because [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3670.08s)]
*  they give a shit about Palestinians, like the guy who quit the state department early on was the one [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3675.44s)]
*  who was in charge of like signing off on weapons transfers. Like that person has been directly [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3681.28s)]
*  responsible for the indestructible of so many Muslim children. Okay. I don't think he gives [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3686.48s)]
*  a, I don't think it's like his appetite for dead Iraqi children and dead Muslim children, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3692.08s)]
*  dead Arab children was, you know, say that enough that he was like, okay, enough is enough. We got [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3698.88s)]
*  to stop. I think it was more so a, in the interest of self-preservation that he was openly declaring [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3705.28s)]
*  America's, you know, suicide pact with Israel to be problematic. Not unlike why in the Vietnam War, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3712.96s)]
*  you had people who supported it for a while, who thought it was strategic for a while. But in the, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3722.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, mostly Eastern establishment pro-NATO, pro-Europe type crowd, you had a flight from that, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3727.84s)]
*  support of that, because they eventually just thought it's not worth it. And we're now suffering [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3734.3999999999996s)]
*  in the places that matter because of it. And that's again, back to the Yankee cowboy dichotomy is, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3740.72s)]
*  you know, the management of what, of the status quo is ultimately to them. And this guy that resigned [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3747.12s)]
*  as, you know, weapons czar, whatever he was, the status management of a good status quo was more [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3753.9199999999996s)]
*  important to him than frontierism with all these risks of chaos. And it's not humanitarian in its [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3759.2s)]
*  nature, but it is the sign that the most extreme elements that still have America's ear and clearly, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3768.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, have measures of influence might be up against something going forward, maybe. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3779.12s)]
*  All right. Well, at this point, I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I would like [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3785.84s)]
*  to show you guys some real history from simple history life under the most, the most evil [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3789.6800000000003s)]
*  communist regime Khmer Rouge. Now I haven't watched it. This is going to be my first [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3796.88s)]
*  interaction with this material and I'm going to let it run for a little bit, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3801.2000000000003s)]
*  especially the intro without pausing because I have to pee. So you won't be able to pause it, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3805.84s)]
*  but as soon as I come back, we'll be able to discuss our thoughts on this, especially [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3811.04s)]
*  because I feel like this will, will be a good rudder to steer this conversation to [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3817.12s)]
*  the blowback podcast and its latest series. All right, let's start. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3825.2799999999997s)]
*  I funded the Khmer Rouge pole pot famine and S 21 1975 to 1979. When the Vietnamese army [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3829.68s)]
*  captured Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge in 1979, they found the city in [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3838.64s)]
*  a terrible state. And among the hardest they came across was a former high school that had been [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3845.44s)]
*  turned into a prison. It was known as security prison, 21 or just S 21. The dark buildings [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3850.3199999999997s)]
*  weren't closed and electrified barbed wire and iron bars covered all the windows. The prisoners [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3857.2799999999997s)]
*  included academics, doctors, monks, students, and their teachers, as well as factory workers [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3862.88s)]
*  and engineers. All were accused of being enemies of the regime and tortured and forced to name [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3868.7200000000003s)]
*  their friends and family members as co-conspirators. Whole families were often brought in together to be [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3874.7200000000003s)]
*  and executed. The paranoia meant that the regime began to turn on itself and the cells were soon [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3880.7200000000003s)]
*  filled with party activists and their families and even high ranking politicians. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3886.0s)]
*  At least 18,145 people had been imprisoned there and all but a handful had been executed. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3891.04s)]
*  S 21 was only one of more than 150 torture and execution centers established by the Khmer Rouge. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3898.8799999999997s)]
*  Today it stands as a memorial to the lives lost and to the brutality that they inflicted upon the [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3906.3999999999996s)]
*  people of Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge was the name given to the members of the communist party of [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3911.68s)]
*  Cambodia. Okay. It seems like you guys had a lot of thoughts on the, on the animation style. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3918.48s)]
*  And the wine, apparently too. I, I hate to say it because Ben has done great work for us, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3926.96s)]
*  Ben Clarkson, but I think we may have a candidate for next season's trailer. Whoever made this, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3933.12s)]
*  this is a little bit of a cut above, I would say what we've done with that video. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3938.08s)]
*  Okay. So you're saying so far, so good. No notes. Yeah. Okay. Well, look, I mean, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3942.8s)]
*  it's not, it's not saying we were kind of talking over it, but it doesn't seem to be saying anything [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3948.96s)]
*  radically inaccurate. Yeah. It's, it's, it's as Brendan pointed out, in fact, he uses like a [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3952.8s)]
*  storytelling element that like we do, which is like, you know, describing the scene, like the [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3957.52s)]
*  moment when like Vietnamese soldiers came into like the torture center of the Khmer Rouge, a place [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3961.52s)]
*  called S 21 or 12 slang in the capital city of Phnom Penh in Cambodia. After the Vietnamese [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3966.48s)]
*  kicked out the Khmer Rouge and you know, it's, it's, it's, it's true. You know, everything that [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3971.84s)]
*  they show in this video is all there. It just looks a little, you know, it's a little long [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3976.48s)]
*  YouTube history. Is this what YouTube history is or history YouTube like, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3982.48s)]
*  is this what we're up against to sign? Is this like, I don't know. I've never, I've actually never [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3987.44s)]
*  even encountered this channel. I don't think it's just, I kind of looked at it and I was like, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3992.4s)]
*  what's a good like short and sweet video that we can use as like, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=3996.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I am enjoying it's like I said, the facts aren't bad. A lot of people in the chat are saying, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4001.7599999999998s)]
*  yes, unironically. Yes. Sadly, this is what YouTube history is like. Cause like sometimes, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4008.0s)]
*  you know, I'll look for archival clips, YouTube, you'd be surprised how much you can find, you know, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4014.0s)]
*  debates or Nixon or Kissinger tapes. And it's just easy to get from there, but I'll have to scroll [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4018.72s)]
*  by a lot of stuff. And you know, it's the thumbnail of like, of a white guy being like this, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4025.12s)]
*  like, like looking shocked. And then he's got like a, you know, like a pastel background and it says [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4031.52s)]
*  like, you know, worst worst war of all time question mark. And it's, I was about to say, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4037.8399999999997s)]
*  if anyone knows the Rob Wiseman tweet, Uber driver, suck me off. It kind of just has a very [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4044.72s)]
*  jarring thumbnailification of, of, of like quite heavy events, but I guess you could say the same [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4051.76s)]
*  thing about some episodes of our show. So I should probably just, you know, be humble. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4058.4s)]
*  Well, that's why we were saying that we should have this guy start doing our animation from now [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4062.5600000000004s)]
*  on. In terms of like the content, I was peeing, so I didn't hear it, but they mentioned American [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4066.8s)]
*  support for Kimmer Rouge early on. Oh, not yet. We're not, we're at the beginning of the story. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4073.6800000000003s)]
*  We have not, we have not gotten there in the video. I wonder if they would, but you know, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4080.16s)]
*  it's funny. There are people in Cambodia. We spoke to them and I went to Cambodia and Vietnam [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4085.92s)]
*  for the purposes of this season. And we had people who were really helpful and, and you know, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4089.92s)]
*  showing us around and even some people there didn't know about America's support for the [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4095.6s)]
*  Kimmer Rouge. It's, it's not that it's top secret. It's in, it was published by the journalists really [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4100.56s)]
*  on top of these stories at the time, but it seems like a much more important fact than it was ever [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4106.0s)]
*  really given, given credit for. And that's part of the reason we were attracted to this season was [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4112.4s)]
*  to not only cover the American of Cambodia and Nixon and Kissinger in the story that is somewhat [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4120.24s)]
*  familiar to people, certainly the Vietnam War is, but to stay after the Vietnam War is over and then [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4125.12s)]
*  see where things went from there. Not only the rise of the Kimmer Rouge, but then their weapon [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4130.88s)]
*  organization by the United States against our old enemy Vietnam. And I think that people would be [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4135.76s)]
*  quite surprised to learn that say when the Vietnamese kicked out Pol Pot, we condemned them [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4141.280000000001s)]
*  kicking out Pol Pot and enforced a sanctions regime against the new government in Phnom Penh [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4146.24s)]
*  during famine conditions. Things that might sound familiar to people from the topic we were just [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4152.96s)]
*  discussing moments ago. So it's, it's a fascinating history and one that I think, you know, as we try [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4158.56s)]
*  to do, one that we think should be more well known. All right, well, let's continue with this [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4164.56s)]
*  work of art. CPK, who ruled Cambodia between 1975 and 1979. They were led by the infamous Pol Pot, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4170.080000000001s)]
*  who attempted to purify Cambodian society along racial, social and political lines. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4178.8s)]
*  This led to one of the worst cases of in history. Influenced by Chairman Mao's great leap forward in [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4184.56s)]
*  China, Pol Pot imagined his own super great leap forward in Cambodia. After seizing power in a civil [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4190.64s)]
*  1970s. You made a face there. Well, I just, I'm intrigued by the thought bubbles that Pol Pot [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4197.76s)]
*  is having. One was just a building and which they did have. Also, like, where is he? He looks like [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4205.360000000001s)]
*  he's in a room in a map. And then they wanted, it seems like he's dreaming of missiles, I guess. I [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4212.160000000001s)]
*  don't. Yeah. Like a super great leap forward with missiles. They're leaping forward with missiles. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4218.16s)]
*  Yeah. Just like Mao. I'm learning. I just like Mao. I'm learning is what I'm saying. In 1975, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4222.96s)]
*  the CPK wanted to rapidly build the country under their own vision. Pol Pot compared the Cambodian [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4227.68s)]
*  revolution with those in China, Korea and Vietnam and proclaimed that no revolution would be as [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4233.68s)]
*  fast as his. Indeed, the CPK was obsessed with speed and many in the party were paranoid that [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4239.36s)]
*  they would be replaced and believe the faster their plans could be achieved, the safer they [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4245.44s)]
*  would be. The super great leap was to be achieved independent of any foreign aid through independent [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4250.08s)]
*  self mastery. That sounds like Kamaruj theorist. What'd you say? Guy sounds like Solid Snake to me. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4256.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. A little bit. Well, I mean, put some respect on David Hader's name, sir. Well, I mean, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4262.08s)]
*  we don't know that it's not him working on this documentary. He would never do such a thing. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4267.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm just hearing him. I'm hearing this. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4273.04s)]
*  Don't you hear it, Noah? I'm waiting for the narrator to say the Kamaruj wanted a weapon, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4290.799999999999s)]
*  a rival metal gear. Yeah, no, it's really like quite intense. It's like, yeah, like, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4298.639999999999s)]
*  like, like, like, I don't know, like, like, like, like brother number snake or something. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4306.0s)]
*  Otacon. Yeah, revolutionary consciousness. Pol Pot lined up everyone with glasses in them. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4310.639999999999s)]
*  Otacon, you have glasses. Of the draft animals needed to plow the fields and by 1975, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4317.759999999999s)]
*  rice production had dropped by 84%. Such a rapid increase in production was impossible, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4324.96s)]
*  but Pol Pot believed this was merely a matter of revolutionary willpower. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4331.28s)]
*  It is worth pointing out, like, Pol Pot was the head of this government, but like, he, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4337.2s)]
*  it was like a clique. Like, it was kind of famously, like, there was a gang that was at the top of the [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4342.64s)]
*  Kamaruj during this period. Again, Pol Pot was the guy in charge, but most famously, there was a [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4347.44s)]
*  foreign minister, Yang Sirri, defense minister, Sun Sen, head of state, like the president, a guy [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4352.8s)]
*  named Kiu San Pan, and like, they kind of collectively, you know, and, and, you know, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4358.88s)]
*  this is also by, I mean, like, in Nazi Germany, like Hitler was the concentrated power of authority, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4365.360000000001s)]
*  but like, he also had like a gang at the top that made it possible for like the Nazi, you know, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4370.0s)]
*  that were like essentially the executive function in that regime. And I think it's, you know, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4375.04s)]
*  like here, it was, you know, again, like much poorer, much less, much different place than 1930s [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4379.92s)]
*  Germany. But like, what you do see is like this group that's like very paranoid, very secretive, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4385.2s)]
*  that are carrying out this crazy radical, like, you know, silly, radically agricultural revolution. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4390.8s)]
*  They're doing it, you know, in this, you know, crazy back, you know, like this [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4396.8s)]
*  psychotically backbiting incompetent way. And so that's like the only thing that I feel like [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4401.2s)]
*  is missing in describing this is that like, as one person we interviewed, the journalist [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4405.68s)]
*  Elizabeth Becker, who reported from Cambodia in these years, she said, not during the Khmer Rouge, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4409.68s)]
*  but before and after, she said that, like, you have to remember that everything the Khmer Rouge did, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4415.360000000001s)]
*  just like imagine it's being done, but it's being done, like really incompetently by like the most [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4420.320000000001s)]
*  incompetent people in ways that you could not overrate or overstate. Also, she was there [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4425.52s)]
*  during the Khmer Rouge years. She interviewed Pol Pot. That's true. She did. She did visit. I [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4431.6s)]
*  just don't want to give the impression that she was like watching all this stuff happening and [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4435.68s)]
*  taking notes, but yes, she had a pretty famous and ill omen visit. Okay. What is in this? Yeah. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4438.4800000000005s)]
*  Chris Bounds What if the tour's Khmer Rouge early on was not about disrupting their Vietnamese [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4444.320000000001s)]
*  neighbors' operations, but instead because Nixon was a secret Maoist? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4455.12s)]
*  Have you guys talked about that? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4462.08s)]
*  Chris Bounds This is what many of his right-wing critics thought. I mean, Nixon, it's interesting [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4464.48s)]
*  because Nixon came up as a part of the China lobby, you know, kind of political club, which [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4470.32s)]
*  were the fanatics about getting rid of the Chinese revolution. But in partnering with Kissinger and [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4475.92s)]
*  making peace with communist China, as we discussed around the same time that we were actually [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4483.2s)]
*  signing on with Israel as a special relationship, Nixon was betraying in a large sense the [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4488.639999999999s)]
*  Cold Warriors that he had come up with. And a lot of people thought he was a communist somehow. So [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4496.08s)]
*  it has been floated like John Birch Society types thought that. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4504.96s)]
*  Just saying, maybe that's something to investigate a little bit further. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4510.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, he is responsible for giving up the true China, which is Taiwan. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4516.88s)]
*  Yeah, which is Taiwan. So just saying. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4525.599999999999s)]
*  Of agricultural offenses, including a nationwide system of forced labor, he believed that achieving [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4530.0s)]
*  his economic goals would be as simple as winning the Civil War. The army and the [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4536.32s)]
*  CPK's agricultural warfare were the people and manual labor was the key to victory. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4541.84s)]
*  The purpose of every Cambodian was to work and advance the revolution. Villages were reorganized [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4548.16s)]
*  into cooperatives and thousands of city dwellers were forced out of their homes to work on the [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4554.24s)]
*  farms. As a result of this policy, workers of all ages were forced to do 10 to 14 hours of hard [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4558.88s)]
*  labor per day in unsustainable conditions. Often survivors reported working late into the night, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4565.52s)]
*  particularly during harvest time, surrounded by encouraging slogans urging them to pledge to [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4572.080000000001s)]
*  sacrifice your life to accomplish Anghar's work or to stay on the work site until death. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4578.8s)]
*  A lot of food was needed to feed all these productive farmers. However, rice was also [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4586.240000000001s)]
*  needed for Pol Pot's economic goals. So large amounts of rice were extracted from the population [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4590.4s)]
*  for party use and export. The CPK provided nothing in return. Farreth, one survivor of the period, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4595.5199999999995s)]
*  recalled that she was assigned to a children's work unit when she was 11 years old. Farreth was [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4604.48s)]
*  ordered to carry soil, dig trenches and help build a local dam. She and her unit lived at the work [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4609.759999999999s)]
*  site. This video, like there was just an interview there with a cartoon person. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4616.08s)]
*  That must be an interview based on reality, I assume, but they're not like sourcing anything. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4623.52s)]
*  So I'm, I'm, I'm just worried this channel may not have, um, uh, the right approach towards [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4628.8s)]
*  sourcing and, and it would undermine its, its, um, academic viability. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4636.72s)]
*  Well, if you've already, if you've already paid a guy on Fiverr, you might as well use them [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4643.68s)]
*  throughout the entire thing. It's an aesthetic choice that they're making. It seems [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4648.56s)]
*  but you know, one that is probably beneficial for, um, for their, their profit structure as well. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4653.92s)]
*  I didn't know David Hayter was on Fiverr, but they, they spent the money well. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4663.04s)]
*  So, um, so I, do you, let me ask you this question. I guess it's like a, like a broader snapshot of [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4668.24s)]
*  this video that we're watching. Do you feel like, do you feel like, um, like covering this, uh, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4677.5199999999995s)]
*  perspective exclusively on how this was communism and it was bad communism, evil, scary, um, gives, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4684.88s)]
*  uh, full attention to, to actually, uh, uh, you know, the rise and fall of the Khmer Rouge. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4693.12s)]
*  Um, I think that like one of the things that sort of, it really just depends on how much weight [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4702.16s)]
*  you, you know, somebody tries to put on the communist dimension of this. Like, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4708.16s)]
*  is this a really communist or Marxist vision? Um, one site source that we cite in the show [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4712.24s)]
*  actually talks about, uh, plans for agricultural reform that had been drawn up for Thailand, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4718.64s)]
*  the country next door, um, that were not all that dissimilar. You know, there, there were real [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4723.68s)]
*  problems that Cambodia faced with a lot of people living in the city, living in Phnom Penh in [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4729.4400000000005s)]
*  particular. And, you know, there, there was some like rebalancing in order, obviously the way that [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4736.320000000001s)]
*  the Khmer Rouge went about it was, uh, stupid and insane and violent. Um, but I think that, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4741.84s)]
*  you know, it's, it's sort of like, it, the Khmer Rouge didn't do all this because they had like a [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4747.76s)]
*  really, um, I think like really like a, like a rich communist tradition they felt, uh, participating. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4754.400000000001s)]
*  And I think that their vision was actually much more nationalist in nature and was much more [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4761.4400000000005s)]
*  focused on a revitalization, uh, and renewal of the, of the ancient, you know, Khmer kingdom. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4766.0s)]
*  And that was the sort of access through which like a lot of, you know, like a project of national [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4771.92s)]
*  renovation was really how, uh, they kind of characterized a lot of this. They didn't even [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4776.56s)]
*  publicly announced themselves as Marxist until a couple of years into the existence of the regime. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4781.04s)]
*  And it was only after Mao died and there was, you know, a lot of pressure, uh, from China, presumably, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4785.92s)]
*  to make that happen. It was China. There was a, you know, there was a communist movement [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4791.44s)]
*  before the Khmer Rouge that was largely dismantled after, um, uh, the, the fifties or in the middle [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4797.839999999999s)]
*  of the fifties. Um, they were the sort of second generation of Cambodian communists and they [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4804.639999999999s)]
*  harbored a lot of bitterness and resentment toward the Vietnamese, um, which had already [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4809.28s)]
*  existed in some kind of cultural and historical sense in Cambodia, but they, they really thought [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4815.04s)]
*  the Vietnamese were the final boss and that everyone in the way, including the American [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4820.16s)]
*  imperialists were, um, going to be the easy part. Uh, and the fact that they did survive [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4825.12s)]
*  the Cambodian civil war and the American bombing in which the Viet Cong did the vast majority of [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4830.4s)]
*  the fighting, by the way, for them, um, only strengthened that idea by the time they take [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4835.599999999999s)]
*  power. They've been in a socialist movement, but it's been one informed by a kind of small [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4840.4s)]
*  inward looking movement that had much more to say about Cambodian nationalism or believed [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4848.16s)]
*  far more deeply in Cambodian nationalism and therefore the xenophobia they had built up [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4854.32s)]
*  than they did on any kind of doctrine or socialist project. And they were criticized pretty ruthlessly [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4859.2s)]
*  by their Vietnamese and Chinese friends. Uh, eventually the Vietnamese weren't their friends. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4864.08s)]
*  And even when the Chinese were their patron, uh, the Chinese stopped trying to argue with them about [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4869.04s)]
*  the extremism of their program because they were useful enough to them. The Khmer Rouge were useful [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4875.28s)]
*  enough to Beijing as a geopolitical ally, but they really didn't think much of the Khmer Rouge [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4880.0s)]
*  program. Uh, so the communist were in the Soviet union, the Eastern block had nothing to do with [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4885.04s)]
*  the Khmer Rouge and in fact tried to unseat them, uh, while the U S was making common cause with them. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4889.92s)]
*  Uh, so as a communist movement, it was really quite a black sheep in the 20th century. And whether [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4896.24s)]
*  you even care about, you know, these labels of what kind of communist they were and blah, blah, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4904.24s)]
*  blah. I mean, there's a lot of writing on that. Some, some suggest, uh, it was a more of a [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4909.84s)]
*  classic peasant revolution that had far, far less to do with, um, modern ideas of socialism and [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4915.28s)]
*  communism, but, um, they certainly first identified as such when the, when they go into the jungles [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4921.5199999999995s)]
*  in the eighties, after the Vietnamese kicked them out and the Americans start supporting them, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4929.04s)]
*  though, they, they were the first communist party to dissolve themselves. And Pol Pot said, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4932.8s)]
*  we're going to have to follow the West now. And they got rid of their Mao jackets and they [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4938.24s)]
*  started wearing safari suits. And so they, they gave up the, the communist look pretty quickly, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4942.16s)]
*  which of course makes some suspect that they, and they also, I don't think wherever like they [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4947.52s)]
*  didn't have like, you know, they weren't, they didn't have like a rich set of relations with [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4952.8s)]
*  other third world nations. Um, they were very isolated. They were, you know, like a lot of [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4957.2s)]
*  communist States, uh, have meaningful foreign relations. And in the case of the Khmer Rouge, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4963.28s)]
*  they had one set of relations with China, which sent them a bunch of money. And that was who they [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4970.0s)]
*  cared about. And then for a time at the beginning, they had relations with Vietnam before that went [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4974.24s)]
*  south. Um, and yeah, I mean, to me, like I, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4979.92s)]
*  Speaker 0 8th [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=4984.0s)]
*  But, but, but yeah, they, they gave up their communism pretty quickly as soon as it became [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5007.2s)]
*  advantageous too. So I guess that if, if, if people want to judge them on how, how they acted once [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5013.12s)]
*  they were out of power, it doesn't seem too sincere. Uh, they, they let them to film a [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5019.2s)]
*  documentary at one point, but otherwise Noah's right. They, their only real relationship in, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5023.280000000001s)]
*  in the trading and economic sense was, was with China and the U S we, we funneled the money and [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5028.08s)]
*  arms and training through a coalition, which is always useful to do kind of like the Mujahideen [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5034.32s)]
*  and just claimed that if anything gets to the Khmer Rouge, we had no idea. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5040.0s)]
*  Of course, uh, it, most of it did Peter Jennings did a great documentary, uh, piece for ABC in the [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5043.92s)]
*  early nineties and we were still supporting them. Uh, and basically told the world that we were, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5050.32s)]
*  um, it's, it's really good. I think it's, I think it's still on you. I grabbed a copy elsewhere, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5056.799999999999s)]
*  but, uh, for the show, but it's, it's a good report and, um, unfortunately didn't, was doing it. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5062.24s)]
*  One thing that you brought up was the way that the media was talking about the Khmer Rouge early on [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5068.08s)]
*  during the period of our, um, you know, not so overt allegiance. And I think that is very [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5074.08s)]
*  instructive usually in figuring out like where the state department's opinions lie. I believe [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5082.88s)]
*  you said that there was like positive coverage as well, not dissimilar to Osama bin Laden from [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5089.52s)]
*  Western media. Uh, in the beginning, the most positive coverage of the Khmer Rouge were coming [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5094.080000000001s)]
*  from a left-wing sympathizers who thought that there was no way that these stories from refugees [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5100.0s)]
*  going into Thailand could possibly be true. There was a history, a very real history. Yeah. The [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5105.52s)]
*  Noam Chomsky paradigm as well. Isn't that like something that he got, he got in trouble for, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5110.4800000000005s)]
*  for saying that we have to be suspect about the stories. I think it's been a little exaggerated [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5115.76s)]
*  to the degree that he, it's not, it's not as though he said there that they're, they're all [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5120.320000000001s)]
*  lies, but he was operating off of the, again, very real history that we also cover in the show of, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5123.84s)]
*  uh, pure invention of communist atrocity, um, when it came to Vietnam. So I think there were a lot [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5129.92s)]
*  of left-wingers who were like, I'm not going to get fooled again. And in some way you did not see it. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5135.68s)]
*  The Vietnamese themselves, like bottled, like they were, you know, like about two years into [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5141.04s)]
*  the reign of the Khmer Rouge, when things, I mean, really after the first year, when things started [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5147.2s)]
*  to go quite badly, um, the sort of like the way that one way that they began resolving their [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5151.6s)]
*  problems without really resolving them was by attacking Vietnam, which China was happy for [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5158.0s)]
*  because they wanted Vietnam. They viewed Vietnam as their principal rival and they were like, well, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5163.5199999999995s)]
*  Cambodia is kind of a basket case, but if they're going to, you know, take the fight to Vietnam, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5168.0s)]
*  then get, you know, good for them. And I think that like in Vietnam, you know, we, we cite sources, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5171.92s)]
*  people who ended up after a border conflict, um, you know, where Cambodian forces, Khmer Rouge [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5176.72s)]
*  forces massacre Vietnamese villages. And, you know, these are people from, you know, Soviet [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5183.280000000001s)]
*  block countries, not necessarily that sympathetic to V to Cambodia in the stage, more sympathetic [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5188.0s)]
*  to Vietnam. And they are just learning, you know, after, you know, like two years into this, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5192.88s)]
*  they're like, oh, only now am I like, like, did I start to consider that like the Cambodian [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5198.0s)]
*  Holocaust stories were real, you know, like, you know, that's what this guy, this journalist, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5202.72s)]
*  this Hungarian journalist called them. But I think that that's sort of a good illustration of also [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5207.6s)]
*  how like the earliest coverage of these people really emphasized like the mystery and secretiveness [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5212.32s)]
*  of this. Because again, like, that's part of what happens when you don't have foreign relations, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5218.4s)]
*  is that like the only people who end up supporting your doofy radical program are academics who don't [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5222.719999999999s)]
*  know better and don't have firsthand knowledge. And I guess China in this case. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5228.799999999999s)]
*  Uh, the more striking stuff is the coverage of them, the positive coverage of them long [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5234.5599999999995s)]
*  after these, these were reported. And we, we cite one New York Times op-ed, uh, that whose title was [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5241.44s)]
*  Pol Pot, brutal, yes, but no mass. Um, and the poll quote in that is Vietnam is the real threat [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5248.4s)]
*  to Cambodia. This was because, and actually that journalist was a very involved journalist in [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5254.0s)]
*  covering the brutal America was waging in Indochina. And he had just preserved a certain, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5259.36s)]
*  uh, I suppose you would say misguided, um, misguided allegiance to the Khmer Rouge [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5266.5599999999995s)]
*  to the point where he opposed the Vietnamese, um, into the nineties for, I guess, being mean to them [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5274.24s)]
*  and overthrowing Pol Pot. At any rate, it was in the New York Times, uh, it was good enough for them. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5280.16s)]
*  And of course there were, um, uh, sort of feigned protests by American diplomats, but they, but we, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5284.88s)]
*  we preserve their seat at the UN and, and, uh, allowed for good coverage of them and positive [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5294.639999999999s)]
*  coverage of them. So that's, that's perhaps more shocking to people. Um, and of course the actual [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5299.76s)]
*  U S policy itself is shocking, but, um, they, uh, when, when Elizabeth Becker, one of the, uh, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5304.0s)]
*  key guests in our show, she was with one of these Western academics, he's all Scottish, I think, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5311.360000000001s)]
*  or he was a Scottish, he was a Scottish academic who worked as a S O S in London, Malcolm McDowell. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5317.04s)]
*  He got, he got a room over from her while they were visiting and she, they were interviewing [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5323.360000000001s)]
*  Pol Pot and she almost got attacked herself, but she escaped and, uh, he, he was, she suspects that [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5329.04s)]
*  the Cambodians did it to kind of say never come back. Um, even though they were the ones who had [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5335.36s)]
*  invited her and then the, the, the deceased guy. Um, so yeah, it was, um, it was an odd ideological, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5340.32s)]
*  uh, trajectory from all sides as, uh, sort of the super third worldists and the American, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5350.8s)]
*  uh, uh, architects of a foreign policy came together in saying these guys aren't so bad [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5358.8s)]
*  because the Vietnamese are the real imperialists at this point. And that was like the like narrative [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5366.48s)]
*  of like Vietnam as like committing like wanton massacres. I mean, there were the issues over [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5372.719999999999s)]
*  like boat people, Chinese ethnic minorities in Vietnam and their treatment. Like Vietnam was [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5377.28s)]
*  catching a lot of black eyes in the sort of global PR, uh, of the time, but like, you know, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5381.76s)]
*  they were absorbing all that while they were like, and they were, people were criticizing them [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5389.4400000000005s)]
*  for being the, you know, military power and control of Cambodia throughout the 1980s. But they [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5394.320000000001s)]
*  always, you know, sort of leave out that like, well, the reason came, the reason Vietnam was still [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5400.08s)]
*  there was because the Khmer Rouge were running the insurgency. So there is this also like this [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5404.8s)]
*  process where it's like they valorize the Khmer, sorry, not valorize, but like they, you know, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5410.16s)]
*  there was this toleration of the Khmer Rouge and, you know, like instead of talking about their, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5414.72s)]
*  or even talking about the Vietnamese tribunal of Khmer, of, you know, for Khmer Rouge, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5420.0s)]
*  not even wanting to engage with the Vietnamese presence at all. We immediately thought like, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5425.12s)]
*  well, how can we use Pol Pot against them? Because they must be so de facto, like, you know, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5428.88s)]
*  they are, they are not us, not Pol Pot. It's the Vietnamese. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5434.32s)]
*  And the Vietnamese had their citizens massacred by the thousands right on their border. You know, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5437.28s)]
*  this wasn't, this wasn't us going to Iraq and starting a 10-year occupation for no reason. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5442.32s)]
*  Or even the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which we covered last year, which, you know, again, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5448.8s)]
*  was right on their border. The Khmer Rouge were hoping to startle with Vietnam and they did. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5453.5199999999995s)]
*  And Vietnam simply said, all right, we're nipping this in the bud. We know all the stuff these [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5459.44s)]
*  people have done and it's not coming to us. And that is why they took the action that they did. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5463.12s)]
*  They probably weren't so interested in an invasion given they had to reconstruct their country, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5467.68s)]
*  which wasn't an easy thing to do. We cover that as kind of like a side story in the show, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5474.08s)]
*  because the U.S. promised Vietnam reparations under Nixon. And once he was ousted, we, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5480.08s)]
*  we said, Nixon who? And denied them their reparations. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5486.72s)]
*  It looks like this video. Oh, no, I was just saying, because this is, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5491.68s)]
*  Hassan was like scrolling this video and it looks like this video is just kind of about like how [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5494.56s)]
*  much life sucked under the Khmer Rouge. Yeah. Like there's a section on children and child labor, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5498.96s)]
*  then there's one on executions and one on prison. I mean, it makes that like, it's interesting in [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5504.400000000001s)]
*  that like the Khmer Rouge did have an interrogation and executions policy. Like, I don't know to what [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5510.320000000001s)]
*  extent this video gets super deep into that, but like all of their torture centers, like it was, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5515.84s)]
*  the whole program was called S 21 and the idea about it. Oh, yeah, this is yeah, this is like [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5521.2s)]
*  the expression. And by the way, this guy, Richard Dunman, he was a reporter at the St. Louis dispatch [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5528.56s)]
*  for many years in the in the in the 20th century. He was an American reporter who had witnessed [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5532.4800000000005s)]
*  firsthand. He had been one of the very few reporters who in the early 1970s was in Cambodia [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5537.84s)]
*  and was with Vietnamese troops, Viet Cong soldiers as they hid from Americans being dropped on [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5545.68s)]
*  Cambodia. So like to give you a sense of how powerful the anti Vietnam dogma was, a guy who [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5551.84s)]
*  saw the Americans Cambodia firsthand and his life was in danger because of it is the guy who wrote [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5557.52s)]
*  this Paul Pot article, because that's how strong that's how much and that's how much we can make [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5563.04s)]
*  them into bad guys. You know, this is another another thread of this season is the Sino-Soviet [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5568.0s)]
*  split, which is really representative of the greater split among, you know, the left all across [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5573.84s)]
*  the world, including the most annoying contingent of the left, the Western left. And the Western [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5580.4800000000005s)]
*  left had a bunch of crack ups about, you know, like, are you a Maoist or you a third worldist? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5586.64s)]
*  Are you supporting Paul Pot and the Maoist movements that the real movements or are you a revisionist [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5591.52s)]
*  social fascist who supports the USSR? And, you know, the USSR wrote off a lot of the Chinese [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5598.0s)]
*  allies and the Chinese themselves. It's a very interesting conflict. But yeah, Dudman, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5605.2s)]
*  I don't know if he was like ideologically on that level, but sort of as a reporter, yeah, he, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5614.48s)]
*  as I said earlier, he was one of these guys who allowed his sympathy in the 60s for the Khmer Rouge [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5621.36s)]
*  fighters to turn him against the other fighters against the American, the Vietnamese. And so it [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5630.639999999999s)]
*  was like this strange, like, sort of siphoning off of support until he people would arrive at [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5638.4s)]
*  only the Khmer Rouge people have a certain people have a certain opinion, which is a strange place [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5645.36s)]
*  to end up. But you can kind of see how it happens. I don't know. Strange times. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5650.8s)]
*  Damn. So would you say that this period of American foreign policy is like uniquely or [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5655.6s)]
*  like, is it the is it the madman? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5664.0s)]
*  In a lot of ways, it makes it makes a lot of sense. Like, that's part of what's so jarring [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5665.76s)]
*  and horrible about it is that like, like, essentially, part of what the Cambodia, there's [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5670.24s)]
*  a book that we say a lot in our show for the season called Side Show by the journalist, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5678.08s)]
*  William Shaw Cross. And although he later on, like, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5682.4s)]
*  Who also had an ideological journey. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5684.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's now he's you can look him up. He's a British journalist. He's right wing now. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5688.72s)]
*  And but this original book Side Show, like it was called Side Show, because the idea was that the [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5694.32s)]
*  Cambodia was a side show to the Vietnam. But I think what our season has sort of recovered [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5699.44s)]
*  is not so much that like, yes, the Vietnam conflict, yes, we Cambodia. And that was [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5705.92s)]
*  because we tried to widen the Vietnam in an effort to end it. We were like, all right, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5710.32s)]
*  well, Nixon said, you know, I'd rather not just withdraw from camp from Vietnam, I'd like to [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5714.4800000000005s)]
*  withdraw from Vietnam, but I want to increase the pressure and I want to draw where I think the [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5719.12s)]
*  Vietnamese are in Cambodia. And eventually that, you know, like that that was pushing the sets of [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5723.360000000001s)]
*  dominoes that lead to the rise of the Khmer Rouge sparking this in that country and all that. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5727.84s)]
*  But the other thing that Cambodia was is not just the side show of the Vietnam, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5731.6s)]
*  but it was this part of, you know, part of this larger drama by which the US was like rearranging [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5735.12s)]
*  what its cold strategy was for what became the final phase of the cold against the Soviet Union. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5741.84s)]
*  The Khmer Rouge and the support for the Khmer Rouge was an early joint venture with China. You could [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5747.28s)]
*  look at it that way. You can see the sort of, you know, the cynicism in our policy is having [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5752.4s)]
*  actually like a really kind of dramatic coherence to it. I think what's what is just how he, you [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5759.84s)]
*  know, how like, you know, what feels immoral is that, you know, there was there was no reason [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5766.0s)]
*  that Henry Kissinger had to Cambodia and also make the time with the Soviet Union. Why couldn't we [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5770.8s)]
*  just have to time? What was the purpose of, you know, setting this country on fire ultimately to [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5775.68s)]
*  arrive at the same thing in 1975 that would have happened anyway, it's years earlier with the end [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5780.08s)]
*  of Saigon, the fall of Saigon. To ventriloquize the Kissinger-Nixon logic a little bit, I think [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5785.12s)]
*  they, you know, they viewed the world in the grand chessboard spheres of influence 19th century [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5794.4s)]
*  Bismarckian way. And that's certainly how Kissinger wrote and thought. And that's how Nixon, maybe not [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5801.84s)]
*  at the beginning of his career, but by the time he was the president, that's how he thought he [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5808.48s)]
*  was considered himself a foreign policy president and one in the mold of creating a stable world [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5812.16s)]
*  order in which America is first among equals. When you take that view, prestige matters a lot. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5818.32s)]
*  And so I think that not to actually disagree with Noah about the human cost of any of this, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5823.76s)]
*  but to their minds, if they were going to embark on as risky and bold a venture as making peace [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5829.28s)]
*  with China and normalizing relations with China to basically drive a wedge in the communist world [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5837.44s)]
*  or take advantage of a wedge that was already forming in the communist world, they couldn't [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5842.32s)]
*  also lose the Vietnam War and also the war in Cambodia. They had to be strong enough by winning [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5846.719999999999s)]
*  or perpetuating that and punishing our victims there to be strong enough and have this credibility [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5853.44s)]
*  of strength to make this other bold move and vice versa. So it became a feedback loop of this kind [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5860.08s)]
*  of horrible logic where big countries we can work with like China or the Soviet Union because [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5865.28s)]
*  they got the SALT Treaty out of it with the Soviet Union, which was good, but it's always [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5870.5599999999995s)]
*  at the expense of the smaller nations. This was something that Fidel kind of said around the time [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5875.84s)]
*  of the missile crisis, which you can agree with and disagree with as well in certain ways, which [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5880.719999999999s)]
*  was like, although overall I find it persuasive, which is the United States and the USSR, we know [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5885.44s)]
*  they're going to work stuff out. The question is what happens to us, the small countries? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5891.68s)]
*  And I think that was the same question hanging over Nixon and Kissinger's peace deals with China [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5895.84s)]
*  for Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. It was a trade-off to them. You couldn't have one without the other. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5902.240000000001s)]
*  In Kissinger's case, the irony, you know, irony, I mean, the horrible thing is that in a way he was [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5908.56s)]
*  kind of the dude who was born for this mission because his actual academic research and what he [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5913.4400000000005s)]
*  spent, or not research, it's a strong word for it, but what he spent time writing about and sort of [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5918.719999999999s)]
*  espousing opinions about in like Foreign Affairs magazine and stuff was about this idea of, you [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5924.08s)]
*  know, fighting little in what he called the gray areas of the world. Yeah, I think, you know, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5929.28s)]
*  like he was a strategy master of this exact thing and, you know, he was ready-made for what [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5934.32s)]
*  Nixon needed, which was in essence to like set the third world on fire. Because by the way, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5943.92s)]
*  it wasn't just, you know, Cambodia, I mean, there's a very good book by the historian Paul [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5948.16s)]
*  Thomas Chamberlain called The Cold Fields that sort of, you know, tells the story of how the cold was [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5952.08s)]
*  this insanely hot in all these little countries. I mean, or you have like active coup. Even some [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5956.56s)]
*  not so little ones like Indonesia. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, Indonesia or Bangladesh and [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5962.4s)]
*  Pakistan, I mean, those are not small countries either. I mean, it's rather, you know, I mean, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5967.12s)]
*  it's rather, you know, they're a piece of peace, you could argue. Yeah, and it's not to defend or [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5974.16s)]
*  revise the idea in America and certainly in the countries where this happened, that Kissinger [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5981.68s)]
*  and Nixon were involved in evil ventures or brutal senseless. But the, I think it's worth [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=5988.8s)]
*  clinically and, you know, carefully looking at why their policy was what it was and what stabilizing [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6000.24s)]
*  things did come out of it and what destabilizing things and terrible things came out of it. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6010.88s)]
*  It was good to make peace with communist China. That was a needlessly hostile and destructive [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6016.4s)]
*  American policy for decades. It wasn't a good thing to obviously base that kind of progress [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6022.48s)]
*  on the expense of hundreds of thousands of people, millions of people in Indochina. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6030.32s)]
*  Anthony Blinken possesses all of the craven aspects, for example, of what Kissinger would allow [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6037.36s)]
*  or enforce for his president on the global stage with obviously zero of the vision [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6044.4s)]
*  or pretenses to vision that you can at least recognize in a self-aggrandizing, but ultimately [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6054.879999999999s)]
*  significant historical statesman like Kissinger. Blinken is just a hopeless fool and the American [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6064.16s)]
*  foreign policy now doesn't have anything like the kind of gutsy vision that these imperial minds had [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6074.16s)]
*  in the middle of the cold. So that's a way of talking about schizophrenia, the different angles. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6084.8s)]
*  Like the last thing I'll say about it to sum it up is in China, when Kissinger died, he is officially [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6090.16s)]
*  a celebrated figure. Americans, you know, there's memes and he was evil, he's the most evil guy, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6096.639999999999s)]
*  which I sometimes think kind of lets every other American off the hook. If it's just like, oh, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6102.0s)]
*  there's just one guy who was just the one evil person. It's not to defend or be an apologist. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6106.48s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of Baby's first, you know. Well, the reason that the Kissinger hate [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6113.36s)]
*  is so passionate is because of a very specific thing, which is that he lied about the Vietnam [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6119.84s)]
*  ending and like the sense of antipathy that I think like generations of Americans have held for him [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6124.4s)]
*  for years in particular really just comes down to like that more than anything, that he was like [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6130.08s)]
*  Nixon's Vietnam butt boy and like that, you know, the justifiable and totally correct hatred of him [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6135.6s)]
*  at front. He got a Nobel Peace Prize. Exactly. It makes a lot, you know, he was sort of, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6142.64s)]
*  I mean, I was going to say, it reminds me honestly of like Elon Musk, like just imagine having to see [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6149.76s)]
*  his mug everywhere for the 70s. Like, my God, that would be annoying. Yeah. Although it must be said, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6153.84s)]
*  Kissinger was a much more, he had far more game than the Neil on Musk. He had far more [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6159.4400000000005s)]
*  Riz than the Neil. Yeah. He did a lot with how ugly he was. So I want to ask you guys one final [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6165.12s)]
*  question, but like in terms of like, I guess on its face, somewhat incomprehensible foreign policy [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6172.320000000001s)]
*  movements that the Nixon Kissinger duo engaged in. Do you see an analog there with the current [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6179.84s)]
*  administration and the way that they're dealing with the dynamics between Hezbollah, Iran, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6186.8s)]
*  the Gulf States, and also Israel? Or is it more so just like you said, on autopilot at this point, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6193.6s)]
*  and it's just like Anthony Blinken is a is a Wormish figure who is just trying to let everybody [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6200.08s)]
*  dominate him. He's just sitting in the cook seat along. I agree with that. The one thing I would [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6207.12s)]
*  add is say that like, you know, maybe the way to look at it is not like, oh, is this situation like [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6215.2s)]
*  that one or something, but it's like, what are the dynamics that were present in that situation? And [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6219.04s)]
*  that may be present in this one and vice versa. Like in this case, you know, like in Lebanon, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6223.84s)]
*  Lebanon and Cambodia are not like an exact parallel. They're not like, and you can't force them. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6229.28s)]
*  But there is a truth to the fact that like Cambodia and Lebanon were both sort of drawn into this, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6234.4s)]
*  you know, they're sort of in a conflict with Israel that is connected to a conflict that is [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6240.16s)]
*  connected to this other frontier of the conflict. And now Israel as the making party in the way that [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6244.24s)]
*  the US was now has to like spread it around because it cannot resolve the domestic political [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6250.639999999999s)]
*  issues that would come with actually just ending the which in Nixon's case was the paranoia about [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6256.24s)]
*  not losing the really, you know, his obsession with that. In addition to the anti communist fervor, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6260.8s)]
*  whatever. And in the case of Israel, it's about like, you know, I mean, it's all the things that [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6265.679999999999s)]
*  we talked about earlier, the ideology, the sense, the actual stakes of survival or financial crisis, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6270.72s)]
*  and so on. But to me, that's sort of the point of comparison is about like, the degree to which like, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6276.56s)]
*  you know, oh, can spread and suck other things in for no good, intelligible reason at all, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6281.68s)]
*  other than to satisfy, you know, the political prerogatives of the making party. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6289.52s)]
*  And we've talked about how there was a vision on behalf that the Nixon, the Nixon and Kissinger were [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6293.68s)]
*  were pursuing. China, detente with the USSR, that was far more, you know, honestly, compared to the [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6299.84s)]
*  policy that came before far more coherent and possibly constructive even. That was taken in [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6308.320000000001s)]
*  tandem with incredibly senseless that they viewed as bargaining chips, the countries involved as [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6314.240000000001s)]
*  bargaining chips. What you have is no vision in the American side nowadays, that compared to [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6318.88s)]
*  their idea of a new world order that they were building, Israel's an alliance with Israel being [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6327.6s)]
*  one part of that. And it's Israel who is taking just the senseless half of the Nixon Kissinger [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6332.400000000001s)]
*  strategy, which is Noah just said, you compare Nixon's remark, when he announced the invasion [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6338.4800000000005s)]
*  of Cambodia, he said, to your point, Hassan at the top of our part of the show, said this is not [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6344.24s)]
*  an invasion. This is a way to end the war in Vietnam. In other words, escalating things into [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6349.599999999999s)]
*  Cambodia is a way to deescalate them in Vietnam. What did Israel say the other day? We are escalating [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6355.44s)]
*  things as a way to achieve deescalation. It's hard not to see an echo of what we discussed this season [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6361.76s)]
*  and the kind of ripple effects that that can have on a formally nearby but neutral [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6371.919999999999s)]
*  third country. And it remains to be said, I hate when people say this, but we have to see [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6379.2s)]
*  how Hezbollah, which has been attacked and has the right to self-defense, how conservative they are [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6384.5599999999995s)]
*  and how much of a balancing act they are willing to put up. Because Cambodia put up a balancing [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6391.919999999999s)]
*  act for many years to spare itself. Eventually it failed. So we'll have to see how that goes in [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6396.56s)]
*  this case. But no one in our current day is unfortunately can be said to be as on the level [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6402.4800000000005s)]
*  of Nixon and Kissinger, I think, as far as their grand master plans. Yeah, I mean, we're now in a [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6409.52s)]
*  position where like the like Nixon and Kissinger part of what made them so special, let's say, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6416.320000000001s)]
*  or unique was that Kissinger literally had permission when he soon as he became a national [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6422.24s)]
*  security advisor to redo the wiring in Washington and become the most powerful advisor, like the [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6427.2s)]
*  hand of the prince or the hand of the king or whatever. Literally, literally the wiring. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6432.5599999999995s)]
*  He could do whatever, he had the authority to do all that. And one of the things with Biden world [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6437.36s)]
*  that sort of become evident is that there's this troika at the top. You have Jake Sullivan, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6443.76s)]
*  Anthony Blinken, and Bill Burns, who's the head of the CIA. And Bill Burns is the one who clearly [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6448.16s)]
*  is trusted with like the big boy stuff or whatever. But like there isn't actually any, you know, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6454.72s)]
*  I don't really believe at this stage that we have any evidence that there is a driver's seat, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6460.0s)]
*  let alone somebody in it in terms of like the American strategic outlook here. So to affirm [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6465.68s)]
*  what Brennan was saying that like, there's nobody who's on the Nixon Kissinger level or whatever, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6471.04s)]
*  because like the situation that we have now is not, you know, is not anything like that. It's [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6475.68s)]
*  this inertia. It's this horrible, you know, I mean, like it's like a parodied artery. That's [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6481.76s)]
*  like, you know, exactly what like, you know, pro-Israel lobby has purchased and won for itself [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6490.56s)]
*  through its machinations. Like that's what it wants, because that is what enables the status [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6496.16s)]
*  quo to persist. I just it was a different era 50 years ago, just a radically different time. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6500.56s)]
*  But is there no, it's just, it's just hard to comprehend when you have to consider that there [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6506.080000000001s)]
*  is like this incredibly powerful force, this blight on human society for so many generations is just [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6512.240000000001s)]
*  like basically, basically falling asleep at the wheel and like the car is just, you know, three [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6519.76s)]
*  seconds removed from flying off the side of the cliff. Like, it feels insane. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6528.16s)]
*  Chris I think autopilot is the right word. I mean, it's not to say like America doesn't know what [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6534.8s)]
*  it's doing or no one's at the wheel. But I think autopilot in terms of the, you know, strategic, [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6540.32s)]
*  you know, again, not to overuse the word, but the strategy, the strategic vision, the idea of how [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6549.84s)]
*  America's power is going to sustain itself over the next hundred years. And Nixon and [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6556.72s)]
*  Gissinger, they thought they had a plan for that. And it wasn't quite 100 years, but they did set [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6562.8s)]
*  down a lot of things in stone that stuck. By now, I think their China policy has been reversed, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6567.360000000001s)]
*  obviously, we're in a cold with China in many ways. The Israel alliance is still there. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6572.88s)]
*  Chris I mean, they left room for that too. It's not like, I mean, strategic ambiguity [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6578.16s)]
*  is obviously like, still leaving a lot of room. Chris The Soviet Union fell, you know, so in a [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6583.44s)]
*  sense, maybe the China factor was not as important to them. Although in Nixon's waning years, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6590.16s)]
*  he did say that NATO needs to back off, because what would come after the Soviet Union, should we [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6596.96s)]
*  continue to creep up to them would be an even as he considered it, an even more dangerous form [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6601.759999999999s)]
*  of Russian nationalism. And he said NATO needs to chill out as did a lot of other cold. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6607.36s)]
*  Kissinger, in his final years was talking about how America should do business with [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6612.240000000001s)]
*  Belt and Road, not attack it. So very different form of statecraft than it's again, it's not to [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6618.56s)]
*  endorse it. But it has very key differences from the sort of again, lazy and incoherent, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2wq75VA6cM&t=6625.280000000001s)]
