# Trump Announces 'Gold Card' Immigration At New Executive Order Signing | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs)
*  It's raw. The earth is raw. The earth is raw and the minerals are here for the taking. That's why Ukraine is so flat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=0.0s)]
*  That's why Ukraine is so flat. Because of the raw, raw earth minerals. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=10.0s)]
*  I think one of the funniest parts about this is that I still don't know what these raw earth minerals are. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=17.0s)]
*  You're right. We need more privatization. Thank God. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=31.0s)]
*  Here are letters that he's signing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=34.0s)]
*  Which one last? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=37.0s)]
*  The one that you're saying. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=39.0s)]
*  No, the digital taxes taking place all over Europe. They're taxing us and they're doing other things. They're suing all our companies. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=41.0s)]
*  And if that's going to happen, we want to be the ones that sue, not them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=48.0s)]
*  And they use it almost as a form of running. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=53.0s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to ask that chatter and many other chatters who look at the current Department of Education and go, it's too costly. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=56.0s)]
*  We pay more per pupil than any of these other nations and our educational outcomes are shit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=62.0s)]
*  Okay. The question I have for you is, do you know that other countries exist? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=69.0s)]
*  Okay. Like Donald Trump loves talking about Norwegian education. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=74.0s)]
*  Donald Trump even talks about Chinese education and says they're beating us. They're beating us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=79.0s)]
*  What do you think is different in China and Norway and many of these other countries that Donald Trump consistently points to when he talks about education? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=83.0s)]
*  Do you think it's actually because they have blossoming private sector, private education opportunities? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=92.0s)]
*  Or do you think it's closer to nationalism or nationalization, sorry, and socialized almost entirely? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=99.0s)]
*  And all publicly funded. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=106.0s)]
*  It's the second thing. It's not because they have private education. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=110.0s)]
*  It's actually a lack of private education. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=115.0s)]
*  They don't treat us right as a country. So we're going to protect our companies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=118.0s)]
*  We have to protect our companies. So we're not going to have any companies left anymore. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=122.0s)]
*  I also want to thank Apple though for announcing they're going to invest $500 billion in our country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=126.0s)]
*  It's private and for profit. You're wrong. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=133.0s)]
*  I don't know if you're Swedish or not, but Sweden implemented privatization initiatives and had to go back on them because they immediately saw a drop in educational outcomes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=137.0s)]
*  Now they're still going back to privatization in Sweden. Okay. After years and years, but, but ultimately it is responsible for Swedish educational Swedish education being on a down, downturn, regardless. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=150.0s)]
*  Sweden is actually a very famous case of, of privatization being a genuine issue. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=166.0s)]
*  Hold on here. We'll look at it right now. Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=173.0s)]
*  Sweden education minister declares for-profit schools, a failure Swedish expert. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=177.0s)]
*  The market system is a disaster for students and Sweden. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=185.0s)]
*  Sweden school minister declares free school system failure. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=189.0s)]
*  Laura at home aims to limit the profit making ability of free scholar in our plans for education reform. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=193.0s)]
*  Sweet here. We have a weird semi privatized system or private schools are state funded, but still for profit. They take our tax money for profit. No, I know. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=200.0s)]
*  And this is a real issue in Sweden because I think it was like a decade ago when they first tried to implement this initiative and squashed it, but it never went away. Here it is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=207.0s)]
*  Okay. From 2015 article that is more than nine years old is a decade past. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=218.0s)]
*  It's a political failure. How Sweden celebrated school system fell into crisis. International ratings have plummeted and inequality is growing after raft of changes, including in duck. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=225.0s)]
*  In introduction of the voucher system, they literally did school choice. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=233.0s)]
*  Okay. They implemented school choices. Sweden SF dubs. Thank you for the five gifted subs. Anyway, are you familiar with how insane the education system is in the US? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=238.0s)]
*  Are you aware of the local school board powers and Rex as a teacher? Our system is so fucked up. My school is purposely failing students to get more money, no discipline and we're becoming more of a diploma factory. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=248.0s)]
*  I know already 30 students that had GPAs under 1.0 and still graduated. I have students that are at a second grade reading and math that are freshmen. Milton Friedman in shambles when he saw this article in hell. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=258.0s)]
*  No, he loves this shit, dude. Are you kidding me? Milton Friedman cares more. He does not have a utilitarian perspective. He cares more about rampant privatization. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=268.0s)]
*  He is totally in favor of government subsidies as long as they are subsidizing private enterprise. These people's worldview is not about uplifting the entire public. It's entirely about might is right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=279.0s)]
*  It's entirely about like rich people getting ahead. You don't give a shit. There are so many examples like this in terms of pupil performance in Sweden. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=295.0s)]
*  And Sweden is a great example of how a country turns reactionary after rampant neoliberal austerity and rampant privatization. Yeah, it's all the Muslims, the gangs that Muslims are committed to. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=305.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, you know, this kind of stuff is actually what's ruining the quality of life in a country like Sweden. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=321.0s)]
*  But hey, as long as you focus on the Muslims, things will be, you know, get all the cards out of Sweden and then it'll be good. Right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=327.0s)]
*  It's rare earths and other things. And look, we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars on Ukraine and Russia fighting a war that should have never ever happened. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=337.0s)]
*  That's a war that would have never happened if I were president. And it didn't happen for four years. People say, how do we know that it didn't happen for four years? Would have never happened. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=349.0s)]
*  And nevertheless, this guy went into this situation and he spent money like nobody's ever seen. Three hundred and fifty billion dollars. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=358.0s)]
*  The other thing that we don't like is that Europe has spent a hundred billion. We've spent three hundred and fifty billion. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=367.0s)]
*  Europe gets their money back because they spent it in the form of a loan and we just gave them whether it's three hundred and three hundred and fifty billion. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=373.0s)]
*  Nobody really knows. They can't even tell me the answer to that. But it means probably more than that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=381.0s)]
*  So what we're doing is now we're saying, look, we want to be secured. We want to get that money back. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=385.0s)]
*  We're helping the country through a very, very big problem. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=390.0s)]
*  We shouldn't have had this problem because it shouldn't have happened, but it did happen. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=394.0s)]
*  So we have to straighten it out. But the American taxpayer now is going to get their money back. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=398.0s)]
*  Plus, Mr. President, yesterday with Emmanuel Macron, you said you had spoken to Putin about the idea of peacekeepers in Ukraine, that Putin was fine with it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=402.0s)]
*  The Kremlin, I guess, has said that that's actually unacceptable to them. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=410.0s)]
*  What's real here? That's not what I was. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=413.0s)]
*  China, Sweden, Japan, countries of strong social standards also have a common relative racial homogeneity, homogeneity, hard to do social safety nets in a racially diverse country where some groups don't want other races to get the same slash any other. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=416.0s)]
*  Government money spent on them. Yeah. Famously China, which is certainly incredibly homogenous. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=427.0s)]
*  Sure. You can say that about Japan. Yeah. Just wait, dude. Once we all of the, all of the brown people then we'll have socialism. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=435.0s)]
*  It's so stupid. This is an economic system. Okay. It is born out of capitalism. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=444.0s)]
*  Shut the up. That's just a dumbass lie that capital owners tell you as well, because it's a great distraction. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=453.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with racial homogeneity. It's ridiculous. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=461.0s)]
*  Mr. President, that war fighting equipment and the ammunition that sustained going forward for Ukraine. How long is it sustained? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=467.0s)]
*  Well, it could go forward for a while and maybe until we have a deal with Russia. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=477.0s)]
*  Look, we're going to we need to have a deal with Russia. Otherwise, it's going to continue. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=482.0s)]
*  But now when Americans put up their money, the taxpayer money and president approves it, we're getting our money back in some form. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=487.0s)]
*  But it could go on for a while or it could be settled quickly. I think it's going to be settled quickly. I spoke with President Putin. I think he wants to settle it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=494.0s)]
*  And like one of the funniest aspects of this also is that like what's the what's the most famous example of an implementation of socialist governance? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=502.0s)]
*  The fucking USSR. It literally is one of the most diverse structures that has ever existed. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=514.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you talking about? Ridiculous. It's all entirely made up. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=525.0s)]
*  The notion that like brown people, the notion that brown people are somehow different than the white people in this country is a made up phenomenon. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=531.0s)]
*  OK, it literally existed throughout time for people that are now comfortably under the banner of white Irish people, Italian people, Polish people, Jews. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=542.0s)]
*  They were all at a certain point not considered white. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=554.0s)]
*  Usually when they were migrating into the United States of America, they were not considered white. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=558.0s)]
*  OK, now they're all white. And there are plenty of studies that clearly show that by the second generation, full blown assimilation takes place by the third generation, virtually indistinguishable. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=563.0s)]
*  But by the second generation, you assimilate to America. You are American. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=576.0s)]
*  OK, the idea that like you're the color of your skin or your ethnic background is some sort of limitation to, you know, social safety nets is moronic. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=582.0s)]
*  There are plenty of countries that are just as diverse as the United States of America, as a matter of fact, like in Canada or even the UK that have way more expansive social safety nets. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=593.0s)]
*  The real problem in those countries is not the diversity that's ruining these nation states. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=605.0s)]
*  The real problem is the capitalists that are trying to undermine these social safety nets with the hopes that they can inevitably privatize it down the line. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=610.0s)]
*  So it's true. Thank you, Brian. It's true. A lot of people in Canada really doesn't think white supremacy has any effect on how politics happen in the US. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=619.0s)]
*  That chatter is right, though. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=627.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You know what? You're right. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=630.0s)]
*  That's why we should kill all of the fucking black and brown people in this country so that maybe one day we can have social safety nets. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=633.0s)]
*  What kind of stupid argument is this? I'm giving you an example of diverse countries that have better social, more expansive social safety nets in the United States of America. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=640.0s)]
*  Are you are you too dumb to understand that? Yes. White supremacy is a very effective marketing tool for division. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=648.0s)]
*  No one is saying you should be so for real. Oh, sorry. We should do remigration. What are you talking about? You're misinterpreting the chatter. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=656.0s)]
*  No, I'm not misinterpreting the chatter. That chatter is bringing up a dumbass argument that racist Nazis use on a regular fucking basis. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=663.0s)]
*  The notion that once this is going to be once this is going to. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=670.0s)]
*  The chatter is right, though. America's history of racism is straight up why social safety nets have been ripped apart in America like it's not necessarily homogeneity, but it's white supremacy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=677.0s)]
*  I'm losing my mind. It is the marketing. It is that is simply the marketing. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=683.0s)]
*  I know. I know that there's appetite for dumbass white Americans to undermine social safety nets because they think black people are getting black people are getting a worse go at it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=688.0s)]
*  But that doesn't change the reality that it is simply marketing to divide the American public and to ensure that they do not recognize their class divisions. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=699.0s)]
*  OK, I hate this notion. I hate this argument. Yeah, I know it is what racists say. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=709.0s)]
*  The divide is pure propaganda. That chatter thinks it's a rule. OK, this has been going on for 20 years more in order to take care of certain species of fish, which wasn't doing very well without water. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=715.0s)]
*  I can tell you. So that's a big deal. It's like not reported. It's incredible. But California has a lot of water that's going to take care of farmers. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=730.0s)]
*  It's going to wetten up the land and it's going to go all the way down to Los Angeles where they have curfews on water, where they have all sorts of blocks on water. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=739.0s)]
*  We can only use so much that we're going to put a until just recently they were going to put a a number of gallons per person living in a house in Beverly Hills on water. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=749.0s)]
*  You're not going to have that problem anymore. Do you have a picture? Let me just see what that looks like. How beautiful is that? Look at that beautiful water flow. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=761.0s)]
*  That's coming in the the dikes and other means of transportation. Is that beautiful? Who would believe that? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=770.0s)]
*  That's all water they could have had. I went to the governor during my first term and I said, why don't you do this? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=778.0s)]
*  And they said environmental. They have an environmental problem with clean water. If this water were there, you wouldn't have had those fires. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=785.0s)]
*  You had sprinklers. They make people put sprinklers in the ceiling of a home and they had no water in them. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=796.0s)]
*  With this, they would have had a lot of water in them. They would have all been full. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=801.0s)]
*  That would have had a whole you would have had a whole different deal down there. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=804.0s)]
*  You probably wouldn't have had a fire, but if it was, it would have been put out. You had the fire hydrants not working in California. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=807.0s)]
*  So it's a beautiful sight. These are canals that were built. These are all built. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=814.0s)]
*  And you saw them for years. They were empty concrete. They call them the V shapes or the pipe half pipes. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=820.0s)]
*  Incredible. He tweeted. He posted his own tweet. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=826.0s)]
*  And they rushed down through the farm areas where the farmers could take it and down to Los Angeles. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=830.0s)]
*  And they were sitting empty for years. And now look at that. Look at that way it looked. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=836.0s)]
*  It wasn't easy. We had to be very unfriendly to get into those areas. We opened it up. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=843.0s)]
*  Mr. President, I essentially attacked California. Can you believe it? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=849.0s)]
*  I attacked. I attacked California. Let's go. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=854.0s)]
*  At the outset of your administration, sir, you committed to ending the weaponization of government, to holding those accountable who participated in the weaponization of government. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=858.0s)]
*  Hold it. This is a good one. Is everybody listening? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=866.0s)]
*  Deranged Jack Smith. We're going to call it the deranged Jack Smith signing or bill. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=870.0s)]
*  One law firm that provided pro bono legal services to the special counsel's office under Jack Smith's leadership was Cummington and Burling. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=878.0s)]
*  As a result of those actions, we're now going to be suspending and putting under review the security clearances for the attorneys and employees at that firm who worked with Jack Smith's team. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=885.0s)]
*  And we're going to continue holding the people who were responsible for the weaponization of government who supported it accountable for what they did. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=897.0s)]
*  And you'll be doing this with other firms as time goes by, right? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=904.0s)]
*  We're looking at sort of the whole panoply of options. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=907.0s)]
*  The weaponization of our system by law firms, even pro bono work they're doing just in order to clog up government, stop government. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=911.0s)]
*  And nobody knows about it more than me. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=921.0s)]
*  And hopefully that'll never happen again. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=924.0s)]
*  Coming to the Burlington. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=927.0s)]
*  Mr. President, may I ask you a question about so long term, do you plan to maintain the number of US? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=930.0s)]
*  Wait, I just want to savor this one, please. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=941.0s)]
*  Who would like this pen? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=944.0s)]
*  Hey, why don't you send it to Jack Smith? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=946.0s)]
*  A deranged person. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=950.0s)]
*  Where the targeting an individual firm or individuals who aren't Jack Smith for his actions. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=954.0s)]
*  I've been targeted for four years longer than that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=960.0s)]
*  So you don't tell me about targeting. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=964.0s)]
*  I was the target of corrupt politicians for four years and then four years after that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=966.0s)]
*  So don't talk to me about targeting. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=973.0s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=975.0s)]
*  There are approximately two million federal employees right now. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=976.0s)]
*  By the end of your term, what do you expect that number to be? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=980.0s)]
*  What would you like that number? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=984.0s)]
*  Well, it'll be lower, but I can't tell you. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=986.0s)]
*  Everybody knows I ran on downsizing government, but making government better. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=988.0s)]
*  I ran on tariffs and making our country rich. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=992.0s)]
*  And that's what's going to do. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=994.0s)]
*  We're going to be doing something else. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=997.0s)]
*  It's going to be very, very good. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=998.0s)]
*  We're going to be selling a gold card. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1000.0s)]
*  You have a green card. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1005.0s)]
*  This is a gold card. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1006.0s)]
*  We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1008.0s)]
*  And that's going to give you green card privileges. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1011.0s)]
*  Plus, it's going to be a route to citizenship. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1014.0s)]
*  And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1017.0s)]
*  They'll be wealthy and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1021.0s)]
*  And we think it's going to be extremely successful. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1028.0s)]
*  It's never been done before or anything like this, but it's something that we're going to be putting out over the next, would you say, two weeks out? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1031.0s)]
*  Do you want to say a couple of words about it? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1037.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1039.0s)]
*  Mr. President, are there any requirements for that gold card? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1040.0s)]
*  Do you have to invest a certain amount of money in this country in order to qualify for that gold card? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1042.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1048.0s)]
*  So the EB-5 program was really, you lend some money, but it was all, it was full of nonsense. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1049.0s)]
*  American immigration has always been pay to win, Chad. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1058.0s)]
*  That was low priced. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1061.0s)]
*  So the president said rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1063.0s)]
*  We're going to replace it with the Trump gold card, which is really a green card gold. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1069.0s)]
*  So they'll be able to pay $5 million to the U.S. government. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1075.0s)]
*  They'll have to go through vetting, of course. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1078.0s)]
*  We're going to make sure they're wonderful, world-class global citizens. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1080.0s)]
*  They can come to America. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1084.0s)]
*  Okay. They 10x that though it used to be 500 grand, I think. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1085.0s)]
*  And they can invest in America and we can use that money. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1088.0s)]
*  And now instead of green, it's gold because it's Trump. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1092.0s)]
*  Why do we give out lotteries of green cards? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1094.0s)]
*  Why do we give out EB-5 for green cards? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1096.0s)]
*  President of the United States understands that the right answer is why don't we eliminate the deficit of the United States of America? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1099.0s)]
*  Oh, it was 1 million. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1106.0s)]
*  It used to be, I think it was 500,000, but now it's 1 million. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1107.0s)]
*  But the gold card will bring in with it people that create jobs. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1111.0s)]
*  No, I think it was 500,000. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1118.0s)]
*  Now it's 5 million. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1120.0s)]
*  They 10xed it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1122.0s)]
*  People in, for instance, you today graduate from the Wharton School of Finance or Harvard or... [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1123.0s)]
*  Chatter is finding out that American migration is pay to win. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1131.0s)]
*  It has always been pay to win. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1135.0s)]
*  It's not a new phenomenon at all. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1137.0s)]
*  These companies that want to get people to be working for them will be able to buy a card. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1140.0s)]
*  And for the people that are number one in their class at top schools, you know, I see that as one of the things. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1145.0s)]
*  But generally speaking, it'll be people with money and people that create jobs. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1151.0s)]
*  And they won't have to pay any tax on income outside of the United States, which they're not paying right now. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1155.0s)]
*  They're not citizens, but they'll have to pay if they create jobs in the United States. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1161.0s)]
*  They'll pay full taxes like everybody else. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1165.0s)]
*  Plenty of countries have this principle, by the way. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1167.0s)]
*  Big taxpayers, big... [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1169.0s)]
*  A lot of countries also have a similar structure where you can just like pay to win and get and gain citizenship. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1170.0s)]
*  And if you add up the numbers, they're pretty good. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1177.0s)]
*  As an example... [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1179.0s)]
*  You just pay it. You just pay for it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1180.0s)]
*  ...cards would be worth five trillion. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1181.0s)]
*  Like a lot of money. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1183.0s)]
*  Five trillion. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1184.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1185.0s)]
*  And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1186.0s)]
*  Well, we have $35 trillion in debt. That'd be nice. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1192.0s)]
*  So we'll see. But it could be great. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1194.0s)]
*  Maybe it will be fantastic. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1198.0s)]
*  We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1201.0s)]
*  It's totally legal to do. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1204.0s)]
*  It hasn't been done before. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1207.0s)]
*  It's been done in many different forms. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1208.0s)]
*  We give them away. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1210.0s)]
*  Why should we give them away? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1211.0s)]
*  We shouldn't give them away. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1212.0s)]
*  And I think it's something very exciting. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1214.0s)]
*  I think it's potentially just something that we're all very excited about. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1217.0s)]
*  So it's a gold card. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1222.0s)]
*  It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1224.0s)]
*  It's a road to citizenship for people. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1229.0s)]
*  And essentially people of wealth or people of great talent where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1231.0s)]
*  Meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long-term status in the country. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1237.0s)]
*  And I think it's something we're very, very happy about. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1246.0s)]
*  Will you have anything to say about that? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1250.0s)]
*  Well, many other countries, by the way, do this, including, of course, your 51st state does that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1252.0s)]
*  And the money's earmarked for deficit reduction? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1259.0s)]
*  It may be earmarked for deficit, but it actually could be more money than that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1262.0s)]
*  I mean, if you did 10 million, it would be you'd have $15 trillion left over. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1266.0s)]
*  But generally, it's going to be paid down debt. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1271.0s)]
*  Do you need Congress for this? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1274.0s)]
*  No, we don't need Congress. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1276.0s)]
*  No, because we're not doing citizenship. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1277.0s)]
*  We're doing the card. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1279.0s)]
*  I see. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1280.0s)]
*  It's a path. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1281.0s)]
*  It's a path to citizenship, a very strong path to citizenship. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1282.0s)]
*  But we're not doing the citizenship. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1286.0s)]
*  For that, I'd have to get Congress. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1287.0s)]
*  And would all countries be eligible for this? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1289.0s)]
*  It depends. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1292.0s)]
*  The countries largely, the people will be vetted very carefully. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1293.0s)]
*  Mr. President, in Ukraine, would you provide military support for Ukraine in the future under a peace agreement? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1296.0s)]
*  Say it again louder. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1304.0s)]
*  Would you provide military support for Ukraine in the future as part of a peace agreement? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1305.0s)]
*  You mean like security? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1311.0s)]
*  Well, people are going to do it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1312.0s)]
*  I think Europe will largely be responsible for that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1313.0s)]
*  European countries will be responsible. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1315.0s)]
*  But Macron asked for a U.S. backup. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1317.0s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1321.0s)]
*  I mean, right now, we're just in the process of negotiating. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1322.0s)]
*  We've pretty much negotiated our deal on raw earth and various other things. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1326.0s)]
*  We'll be looking at that security. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1332.0s)]
*  You're talking about general security for Ukraine later on. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1333.0s)]
*  I don't think that's going to be a problem. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1337.0s)]
*  It depends. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1338.0s)]
*  There are a lot of people that want to do it. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1339.0s)]
*  And I spoke with Russia about it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1340.0s)]
*  They didn't seem to have a problem with it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1342.0s)]
*  I think they understand. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1344.0s)]
*  They're not going back in. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1345.0s)]
*  Once we do this, they're not going back in. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1346.0s)]
*  So, on that gold card, would the U.S. provide, for instance, air defense? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1348.0s)]
*  Well, I just told you, right now, we're not providing anything. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1357.0s)]
*  You know, it's about Europe, too. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1360.0s)]
*  Europe put in 100 billion. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1362.0s)]
*  The earth is raw. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1364.0s)]
*  The earth is raw, and the minerals are here for the taking. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1366.0s)]
*  That's why Ukraine is so flat. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1370.0s)]
*  That's why Ukraine is so flat because of the raw earth minerals. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1372.0s)]
*  I think one of the funniest parts about this is that, like, I still don't know what these raw earth minerals are. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1379.0s)]
*  And everybody keeps saying, like, the last time there was an accurate assessment of these raw earth minerals was, like, during the USSR. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1387.0s)]
*  So I don't even know how much raw earth minerals they actually have. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1394.0s)]
*  Raw earth minerals. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1400.0s)]
*  They're so raw. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1404.0s)]
*  Not rare. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1406.0s)]
*  Raw. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1407.0s)]
*  We're going to take them raw. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1408.0s)]
*  It's not raw, buddy. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1416.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1417.0s)]
*  My president. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1419.0s)]
*  My president. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1421.0s)]
*  He's right. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1423.0s)]
*  You're wrong. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1424.0s)]
*  It's raw now. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1430.0s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1434.0s)]
*  Is Steve Budkof delaying his trip to the Middle East? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1442.0s)]
*  He is covering his bruise. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1460.0s)]
*  He has a bruise on his left hand. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1462.0s)]
*  I saw that too. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1464.0s)]
*  I follow all the Lib accounts, okay? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1466.0s)]
*  I know all the latest in global technology. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1468.0s)]
*  He had a long night of drinking, so he got the IV. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1490.0s)]
*  No, I think the opposite. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1493.0s)]
*  So, as you know, they weren't going to release any more hostages. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1494.0s)]
*  And I said there's going to be held to pay. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1498.0s)]
*  And then they agreed that they were going to release the hostages that they had agreed to release, plus an extra one. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1500.0s)]
*  And so that you could say that was a big difference. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1507.0s)]
*  But I said it from that point, it's up to Bibi Netanyahu and Israel. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1511.0s)]
*  I may have taken a different stance, but they did release. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1517.0s)]
*  They went back to releasing the hostages. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1520.0s)]
*  But if you remember, they said we weren't going to release any. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1523.0s)]
*  They've totally ended it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1526.0s)]
*  And I said, well, they're not going to release any. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1528.0s)]
*  They'll be held to pay. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1530.0s)]
*  But the rest is really up to him. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1532.0s)]
*  I may have done it differently than him. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1534.0s)]
*  It's not my decision. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1537.0s)]
*  It's his decision. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1538.0s)]
*  But they did release all of those hostages. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1539.0s)]
*  Mr. President, when you spoke to Vladimir Putin, did he raise or did you discuss at all the possibility of a minerals deal? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1542.0s)]
*  On the Ukrainian land that Russia now controls, that they're trying to deal with Russia. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1546.0s)]
*  I'd like to buy minerals on Russian land, too, if we can. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1551.0s)]
*  The rare earth. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1556.0s)]
*  They have very good rare earth also. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1557.0s)]
*  They both do. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1559.0s)]
*  I would say that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1560.0s)]
*  And oil and gas. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1561.0s)]
*  Look, it's a great thing if we sell this. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1562.0s)]
*  It's great for Russia, too, because we can do deals there. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1564.0s)]
*  They have very valuable land that isn't utilized. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1567.0s)]
*  So something like that could take place. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1570.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1572.0s)]
*  Have you got raising or lifting sanctions against Russia on the table? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1573.0s)]
*  No, we haven't lifted any sanctions on anybody. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1577.0s)]
*  On the table as part of any negotiation? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1580.0s)]
*  I guess it will be at some point. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1581.0s)]
*  But right now we haven't agreed to lift sanctions on anybody. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1583.0s)]
*  On that gold card getting back to that, I'm fascinated by this, Mr. President. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1586.0s)]
*  You should be fascinated by it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1589.0s)]
*  Your taxes will go down to nothing. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1591.0s)]
*  Would a Russian oligarch be eligible for a gold card? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1593.0s)]
*  Yeah, possibly. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1597.0s)]
*  Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1598.0s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1601.0s)]
*  They're not quite as wealthy as they used to be. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1604.0s)]
*  They're not as wealthy as they used to be. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1607.0s)]
*  I think they can afford $5 million. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1610.0s)]
*  No, a lot of people are going to want to be in this country. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1613.0s)]
*  And they'll be able to work and provide jobs and build companies and pay taxes. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1618.0s)]
*  All of those things. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1624.0s)]
*  It's an incredible thing. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1625.0s)]
*  This is the group that is the first to hear it. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1628.0s)]
*  Nobody's heard about it. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1631.0s)]
*  Nobody ever thought about it. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1632.0s)]
*  But we've been thinking about it very, very strongly over the last week. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1634.0s)]
*  And I was going to announce it sometime next week. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1638.0s)]
*  And I figured, why not? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1641.0s)]
*  We have a lot of cameras blazing right now. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1642.0s)]
*  We might as well do it now. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1644.0s)]
*  We'll have Caroline announce it the next time. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1647.0s)]
*  No, it's a great thing. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1649.0s)]
*  The gold card. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1650.0s)]
*  Remember the words. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1651.0s)]
*  The gold card. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1652.0s)]
*  Somebody said, can we call it the Trump gold card? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1653.0s)]
*  I said, if it helps. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1655.0s)]
*  If it helps, use the name Trump. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1657.0s)]
*  I'll give it to you for free. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1659.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1660.0s)]
*  President, you probably just launched 10,000 stories. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1661.0s)]
*  Do you want to elaborate a little bit more on what Russian oligarchs you know or don't know? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1663.0s)]
*  Isn't it interesting how many stories we do tell? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1666.0s)]
*  And they all turn out to be true. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1670.0s)]
*  And they all turn out to be ultimately correct. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1672.0s)]
*  Trump was right about everything. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1675.0s)]
*  Do you have one of those Trump was right about everything hats? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1676.0s)]
*  I'm going to give it to this gentleman. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1678.0s)]
*  Get me one of them. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1682.0s)]
*  But they're all going to be vetted. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1683.0s)]
*  Everybody who comes in gets vetted. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1684.0s)]
*  Okay, they get vetted. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1687.0s)]
*  So you got to, you know, we're going to begin in two weeks. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1688.0s)]
*  About two weeks. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1694.0s)]
*  The sale will start in about two weeks. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1695.0s)]
*  Do you see a more active role for Zelensky now? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1698.0s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1703.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I think that we want to get that country back on its feet. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1704.0s)]
*  And right now it's it's been destroyed. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1708.0s)]
*  And so here, give me this here. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1710.0s)]
*  Give me all of them. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1712.0s)]
*  Look, yes. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1713.0s)]
*  See that? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1715.0s)]
*  Trump was right about everything. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1717.0s)]
*  Just came in. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1720.0s)]
*  Somebody said, I said, Look, this is a hat that says I'm right. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1721.0s)]
*  We should make some of them. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1725.0s)]
*  Where is a clown show, dude? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1727.0s)]
*  An absolute clown show. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1730.0s)]
*  I know him well. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1733.0s)]
*  He's sort of a stiff. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1734.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1735.0s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1736.0s)]
*  What do you have to say to that? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1737.0s)]
*  Here's a hat that says I'm right. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1739.0s)]
*  Would anybody like one? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1741.0s)]
*  Mr. President, an easy question, perhaps. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1742.0s)]
*  Maybe it's difficult. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1745.0s)]
*  I'm going to ask you this question about the super Bowl. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1746.0s)]
*  Who do you work for? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1748.0s)]
*  I work for two news organizations. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1749.0s)]
*  Who? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1750.0s)]
*  I work for two news organizations. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1751.0s)]
*  Who are they? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1752.0s)]
*  I work for Grey Television, America's second largest broadcaster. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1753.0s)]
*  And I work for I Heart Radio. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1756.0s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1758.0s)]
*  Let me ask you the easier, tough question, Mr. President. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1759.0s)]
*  The Philadelphia Eagles on the Super Bowl, are they being extended an invitation? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1762.0s)]
*  They will be. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1767.0s)]
*  We haven't yet. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1768.0s)]
*  But we will be. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1769.0s)]
*  I thought it was a great performance by them. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1770.0s)]
*  And absolutely, they'll be extended that invitation. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1773.0s)]
*  Would you do that? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1777.0s)]
*  He got so mad. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1778.0s)]
*  We'll do it right away. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1779.0s)]
*  We're going to do it sometime today. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1780.0s)]
*  And they deserve to be down here. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1782.0s)]
*  And we hope to see them. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1784.0s)]
*  We have a lot of team. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1786.0s)]
*  We just had the great hockey team, as you know, Florida come here. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1787.0s)]
*  We have many of the great athletes come. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1791.0s)]
*  Only an idiot would argue with a hat. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1793.0s)]
*  Well, they have to get together. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1795.0s)]
*  They've had a lot of discussion back and forth. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1796.0s)]
*  They both are meaning well. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1799.0s)]
*  And a deal will ultimately happen. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1800.0s)]
*  I think it'll happen pretty quickly. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1803.0s)]
*  It'll be nice to see the golfers, the best golfers, be able to play against each other. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1805.0s)]
*  What's your role been in this whole process? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1810.0s)]
*  Just to help expedite it. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1812.0s)]
*  Tiger was here. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1814.0s)]
*  Adam Scott was here. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1815.0s)]
*  Jay Monahan was here the other day. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1817.0s)]
*  Just to really help expedite it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1820.0s)]
*  We had Yasser here from Saudi Arabia. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1823.0s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1825.0s)]
*  These are all great people. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1826.0s)]
*  And they want to work it out. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1828.0s)]
*  So if I can help them work it out, I don't get anything out of it. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1829.0s)]
*  If I can help them work it out. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1832.0s)]
*  I just think golf, it's very much of an individual sport. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1834.0s)]
*  And you want to see the best players playing against each other, not playing in two different locations. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1838.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1843.0s)]
*  What's going to be more challenging? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1844.0s)]
*  A PGA live deal or Russia-Ukraine deal? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1845.0s)]
*  I think the PGA deal is much more challenging. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1848.0s)]
*  Sir, may I ask you a Middle East question, if I may? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1850.0s)]
*  What's your take on what's happening in the West Bank and what Israel is doing there? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1853.0s)]
*  Well, there's a movement up there that a lot of people are concerned about. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1857.0s)]
*  And there's been a lot of Israeli movement up there for a reason. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1861.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, maybe they're not feeling so good about that. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1865.0s)]
*  So that would be terrible. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1870.0s)]
*  I hope that doesn't happen. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1871.0s)]
*  But I think the PGA deal is much more challenging. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1873.0s)]
*  I think the PGA deal is much more challenging. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1877.0s)]
*  I think the PGA deal is much more challenging. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1879.0s)]
*  And I think that's a terrible thing. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1882.0s)]
*  I hope that doesn't happen. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1884.0s)]
*  But there is movement up there that nobody knew about. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1886.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1890.0s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1891.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1892.0s)]
*  And when you say you concerned about it. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1893.0s)]
*  I'm concerned about everything. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1895.0s)]
*  I want the world to be peaceful. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1897.0s)]
*  You know, when I left here, we had no war. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1898.0s)]
*  We had defeated ISIS in less than four weeks. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1901.0s)]
*  Winners. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1904.0s)]
*  Raising Cain, you know? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1905.0s)]
*  Raising. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1907.0s)]
*  When I heard that name, I said, I like that name. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1908.0s)]
*  That's the kind of general I like. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1909.0s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1910.0s)]
*  But he was great. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1911.0s)]
*  He's a great soldier. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1912.0s)]
*  Not a politician, a soldier. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1914.0s)]
*  A real soldier. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1916.0s)]
*  You know that, Brian. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1917.0s)]
*  This guy was the real... [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1918.0s)]
*  I've heard that story a million times. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1919.0s)]
*  Yeah, this guy's the real deal. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1921.0s)]
*  He is. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1922.0s)]
*  And I think he's going to do a great job. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1923.0s)]
*  But think of it. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1925.0s)]
*  We had no wars. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1926.0s)]
*  We had no problems. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1927.0s)]
*  We had no inflation. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1928.0s)]
*  We had no problems. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1930.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you have October 7th in Israel, which was horrible. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1932.0s)]
*  And then you see what happened with... [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1938.0s)]
*  Ukraine would have never... [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1941.0s)]
*  Russia would have never gone in if the election weren't rigged. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1943.0s)]
*  It was a rigged election. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1946.0s)]
*  The 2020 election was rigged. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1947.0s)]
*  And we got out of it, and you see what happened. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1949.0s)]
*  You see what happened to our country. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1953.0s)]
*  Inflation, Afghanistan, that horrible withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1954.0s)]
*  I think when Russia saw what happened in Afghanistan... [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1959.0s)]
*  I was saying different than Biden's ramblings. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1962.0s)]
*  He's more coherent and he doesn't say, ha-but-a-but. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1964.0s)]
*  And he also... [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1967.0s)]
*  If you're asking me like what the... [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1969.0s)]
*  That's the serious answer. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1971.0s)]
*  Yes, he is still rambling like an old man, but there's a little bit more charisma to his rambling. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1973.0s)]
*  And he doesn't look like a fucking decaying carcass. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1981.0s)]
*  What are you expecting at the cabinet meeting tomorrow? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1984.0s)]
*  It's going to be a cabinet meeting, and I'll preside, unlike Biden, I'll preside over my own cabinet meeting. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1987.0s)]
*  Mr. President, how do you compare your cabinet in your second term to your cabinet that you had in your first term? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=1994.0s)]
*  Well, I had some great people in my second term. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2000.0s)]
*  I think this is deeper. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2002.0s)]
*  I think it's better because it's deeper. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2004.0s)]
*  I had some people that I didn't really like too much in my cabinet. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2006.0s)]
*  But I didn't know Washington then. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2010.0s)]
*  I'm a New York person. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2012.0s)]
*  I knew New York intimately, but I had to rely on people. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2013.0s)]
*  I had great people. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2017.0s)]
*  Look, we got the biggest tax cuts in history. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2018.0s)]
*  I rebuilt the military, but we did so much. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2020.0s)]
*  We did unbelievable. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2023.0s)]
*  Even Right to Try. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2024.0s)]
*  Somebody was saying today they were saved by Right to Try. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2025.0s)]
*  We did Right to Try medically. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2028.0s)]
*  We did transparency medically. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2031.0s)]
*  That was a big thing, but Biden canceled that one. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2033.0s)]
*  He didn't cancel Right to Try, which is interesting. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2036.0s)]
*  He didn't cancel Space Force. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2039.0s)]
*  He was going to cancel Space Force. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2040.0s)]
*  Space Force is turning out to be invaluable. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2042.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2046.0s)]
*  We created Space Force. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2047.0s)]
*  But think of it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2048.0s)]
*  We rebuilt our entire military, and now we're going to have to patch it up a little bit again because of what's happened. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2049.0s)]
*  No, this was a grossly incompetent administration. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2057.0s)]
*  The only thing they were good at was cheating in elections and the weaponization of government. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2061.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2065.0s)]
*  Thank you, Travis. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2067.0s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2068.0s)]
*  The lesson to learn from all of this 100% is obviously you need, you need whoever comes in charge. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mXUY90WIs&t=2069.0s)]
