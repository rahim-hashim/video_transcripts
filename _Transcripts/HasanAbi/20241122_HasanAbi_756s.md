# Ben Affleck, Sam Harris And Bill Maher Debate Islam | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I)
*  That part was great. The greatest defender of all time. I'm Bill Maher against his Islamophobic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=0.0s)]
*  tendencies will forever be will forever be. And I hate to give this to him because he's very [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=5.68s)]
*  different now. Glenn Greenwald that, that Ben Affleck clip is great, but Glenn Greenwald on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=11.6s)]
*  on Bill Maher, if anyone has the clip is a classic one. I used to play it all the time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=19.04s)]
*  Here's another throwback to Ben Affleck owning Sam Harris. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=23.84s)]
*  And behavior is not going to do that. A lot of talk. The great divide, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=53.84s)]
*  the great divide is not between Islam and the rest. It's rather between the fundamentalists [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  and the moderates in each faith. Okay, but we're misled to think that the fundamentalists are the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=64.08s)]
*  fringe. Okay, we have jihadists, Islamists and conservatives. And by the way, it depends on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=67.68s)]
*  where millions of people fit that description. You're saying that the strongest voices are [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  coming from those who are jihadists and extremists. And that's a bigger piece of the pie than we [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=79.36s)]
*  often think is true. There's no question. Okay. So having said that, and if you even if that is true [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=86.08s)]
*  statistically or otherwise, the key thing to recognize that I don't think is part of the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=91.52s)]
*  argument, but I think should be, is that there are voices that are oftentimes raised in opposition to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=96.8s)]
*  these jihadists into these extreme acts. But guess what? They don't get covered. They don't get [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=103.84s)]
*  exposed. And they're not given the same level of platform that we see the jihadists get. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=109.2s)]
*  One reason they don't get exposed is because they were afraid to speak out because it's the only [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=115.92s)]
*  religion that acts like the mafia that will kill you if you say the wrong thing, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=120.4s)]
*  draw the wrong picture or right. Yeah, dude, famously, famously, the only religion that acts [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=128.64s)]
*  like the mafia and you is Islam. Okay. Yeah. Brother, your refusal to understand nuance in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=136.16s)]
*  this conversation is leading you down this illogical pathway of thinking. Okay. This is why I just, you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=144.16s)]
*  know, I harbor a lot of resentment for Islamophobic r slash atheist guys, the militant atheists. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=152.08s)]
*  Okay. Not only historically have Christians done that, but they still continue to do that. What [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  are we talking about when Israel claims they're doing it for Judaism? They're also, you know, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=163.36s)]
*  I don't agree. I don't believe that they're doing it for Judaism. Just as much as I don't believe [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  ISIS has anything to do with Islam. Okay. But Bill Maher on the other hand does think that that's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  appropriate and good. Okay. Same with George W. Bush saying he invaded, God told him to invade [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=178.48s)]
*  Afghanistan with a shit ton of, you know, very far right Christian generals who wanted to dip the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=184.72s)]
*  dip their bullets in pig's blood. Okay. Do you track that as a radical Christian act? You don't. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=191.6s)]
*  And the people that say they do are lying because they want to win that argument. Because when you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=198.72s)]
*  live in a dominant Christian culture, you have the capacity to understand and separate fundamentalism [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=203.92s)]
*  from the acts of from the acts of like the everyday average Christians. Right. The wrong book. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  There's a reason why Ion Hersey Ali needs bodyguards 24 seven that element of fear as well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=218.0s)]
*  But you also have other braver souls out there who do speak out. Ion Hersey Ali, another grifter, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  who's now a Christian, by the way, Christian convert Christian convert Ion Hersey Ali, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=229.6s)]
*  and who like like who are risking their lives like the like the the Muslim clerics and others [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  and from Australia to to Europe to the United States just recently publicly put their names on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=240.4s)]
*  paper declare declaring their opposition to what ISIS and others are doing. So there are those [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=246.48s)]
*  voices. But where was the coverage? Where was where was that story to sort of create a different [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=252.16s)]
*  what is your solution? What is your act to just condemn the solution? The solution is very much [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  we killed more Muslims and they've killed us by an awful lot. We've invaded more. I am not [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=262.88s)]
*  from work. It's an awful lot. Yet somehow we're exempted from these things because they're not [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=266.88s)]
*  really a reflection of what we believe in. We did by accident. That's why we invaded. We're not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=270.88s)]
*  we're not convincing anybody. It's not telling you that I disagree with what you think. I know. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=276.4s)]
*  And we're obviously not convinced. I don't understand it. You don't understand. You know, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=281.84s)]
*  black people, you know, they show. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's based on facts. I can show you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=286.72s)]
*  a pew poll of Egyptians. They are not outliers in the Muslim world that say like 90 percent of them [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=291.92s)]
*  believe death is the appropriate response to leaving the religion. If 90 percent of Brazilians [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=297.04s)]
*  thought that death was the appropriate response to leaving Catholicism, you would think it was a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=302.72s)]
*  bigger deal. I would think it's a big deal no matter what. Okay, but that's the fact. But what [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean to say it's all Brazilians. I wouldn't say well Ted Biden did this. God, these gays are all [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  trying to eat each other. You know, okay, let me just give you what you want. There are hundreds [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=316.4s)]
*  of millions of Muslims who are nominal Muslims who don't take the faith seriously, who don't want [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  to kill apostates, who are horrified by ISIS. And we need to defend these people, prop them up and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=323.84s)]
*  let them report apostates. That was a early relic. That was early relic of the the post 9 11 [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=328.64s)]
*  Islamophobia that are slash atheists always love talking about every all these Muslims want to kill [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=336.08s)]
*  apostates. Yeah, I think it's got to be because I think it came from the fact that like so many [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=340.8s)]
*  ex-Muslim people that became like our our slash atheism dipshits were wanted to like [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  heighten their importance. So I think like they presented their worldview as like, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=354.32s)]
*  no, every single every single Muslim will like immediately kill you if you leave the religion. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=360.24s)]
*  I think that's what it is. Like, because I don't know where the f**k this came from. And I know [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=364.56s)]
*  people will say, it's the religion, sweetie. It's like, no, that's not really like, it's not really [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=369.04s)]
*  a commonly shared opinion. Yeah. See Turks in the chat saying that they're embarrassed, but they did [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=374.48s)]
*  that as well. A lot of us atheists like Turks and former Muslims are for people who grew up in Muslim [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  countries that don't like Islam oftentimes play this very formative role in shaping people's [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  understanding of it. Not realizing that it like, you know, contributes to their own personal [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=392.24s)]
*  dehumanization. Yonmi parks, all of them. I just couldn't feel a double a ballpark in Charleston, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=397.28s)]
*  West Virginia. And you were making a career. It's all jihadist. It's global. It's a phenomenon of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=403.11999999999995s)]
*  global. I think that's the opposite. There is those things. There's ISIS, there's global jihadist. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  The question is the degree to which you're willing to say, because I've global jihadist dude is [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=413.52s)]
*  what a time to be alive, dude. I mean, look, this is why I sometimes say we're back, but we're not [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=419.44s)]
*  as back as, as we were, you know what I mean? Do you understand? Like things are this bad, but I [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=424.72s)]
*  don't know. Aesthetically speaking, it's not this level. Like things are bad, but it still hasn't [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  hit this level. I think it will get there though. When Trump is in office, witness this behavior, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  which we all object to on the part of these people. I'm willing to, these people are talking about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  talk fear, which is basically ex communication, but that phrase isn't mentioned in the Quran, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  nor is it supported by many Islamic scholars as seen as an Islamic militant thing. No, dude, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=451.52s)]
*  you don't understand. Everyone's always killing people for leaving the religion famously. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=455.84s)]
*  Flatly condemn those of you. I don't know. This is based on people, it's ideas and people who [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=461.52s)]
*  believe in those ideas. So people believe based on reality. Ben, we're not making it up that there [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=468.56s)]
*  is that in the Muslim world it is mainstream belief, but this is such a caricature of Indonesia, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=474.96s)]
*  of Malaysia, so much of the world. And this does have the tinge a little bit of the way white [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=482.48s)]
*  p***s talk about African-Americans and define blacks by what you're saying is minority. We [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=487.2s)]
*  shouldn't make, we shouldn't, we shouldn't criticize that much of a minority. It's like its [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=493.28s)]
*  biggest religion in the world. Exactly. But there, but you're treating them like a minority. I mean, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=498.0s)]
*  if Filipinos were capturing teenagers and sending them into white slavery, we would [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=502.48s)]
*  criticize that. We wouldn't say, well, they're people who are doing it, not the Philippines. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=506.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? Well, what if the Filipino kid lives on the street from you and I have [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  nothing to do with that? So these are different things, crazy racial stereotypes. Let's talk, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  we mentioned ISIS. Let's talk about that. F***ing own. That part was great. The greatest defender [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=520.0s)]
*  of all time, I'm Bill Maher, against these Islamophobic tendencies will forever be, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=525.12s)]
*  will forever be. And I hate to give this to him because he's very different now. Glenn Greenwald [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=530.72s)]
*  that, that Ben Affleck clip is great, but Glenn Greenwald on, on Bill Maher, if anyone has the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=536.64s)]
*  clip is a classic one. I used to play it all the time. It's not our fault. What came out? We [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=543.28s)]
*  didn't go into Egypt. We wound up with the Muslim brother. We were supporting and popping up Mubarak [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=549.12s)]
*  for 30 years, even as we were cheering for all the Tahir square demonstrators, as though we were [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  on their side. It was our government that kept Mubarak in power, just like we've done across the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=560.48s)]
*  entire Muslim world. And it's amazing for you to say that, well, look at all these Muslims. The [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=564.88s)]
*  minute you give them a little bit of freedom, they go wild and they start being all violent. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=570.16s)]
*  How can you be a citizen of the United States, the country that has generated more violence and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=573.52s)]
*  militarism in the world over the last five or six decades and say, look at those people over there. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=578.4s)]
*  They are incredibly violent. We play a significant role in what has been happening in the Middle [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=583.36s)]
*  East because we've been interfering and dominating that region in order to have access to the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=588.08s)]
*  world. I wasn't talking about violence. I was talking about theocracy. That doesn't happen here. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=591.36s)]
*  That doesn't happen here. But at the same time, Iran is invading lots of other countries and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=596.72s)]
*  occupying them for a decade, nor are fundamentalist Muslim countries the way the United States is. So [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=600.72s)]
*  these things are interlinked because we are continuously interfering in that part of the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  world. And so to say it's all our fault. It's not all our fault. But when you send your military for [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=610.48s)]
*  six straight decades into other countries to bomb them, kill their children and women and innocent [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=615.28s)]
*  men, prop up dictators, yeah, you take responsibility for your actions and say to the extent of that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=620.4s)]
*  region. That religion goes back a thousand years before our revolution. So I don't think we can [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=626.16s)]
*  take all this is so unimaginably because Islam and its golden age literally carried water [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  for history continuing. Islam and its golden age led to many inventions that we take for [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=637.52s)]
*  fucking granted. Islam and its golden age is the reason why so many important academic materials [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=642.8s)]
*  were preserved. So he literally automatically with his racist ass, white supremacist ass, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=648.7199999999999s)]

*  If I could just make one quick point about Egypt. That silly liberal view that all religions are [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=695.44s)]
*  like because it makes you feel good. No, it makes you feel dude, dude, dude, dude. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=699.9200000000001s)]

*  You got to say our side is better than the people over there. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=710.96s)]
*  It makes you feel good to put a crown on your head and say, I'm a good person. How do I prove [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=713.2s)]
*  that? You get to ignore the responsibility that your own government has for the violence and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=716.96s)]

*  him. His career has just been a sequence of fucking L's downstream post that moment of moral clarity. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=740.08s)]
*  Anyway, so yeah, people are yelling at Joe Rogan saying he's a dragon defender for a fucking clip [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQYncdsxa0I&t=748.6400000000001s)]
