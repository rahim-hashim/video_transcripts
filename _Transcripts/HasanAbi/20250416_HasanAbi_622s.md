# The Movie About Rapper Kneecap Shocked Me | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE)
*  shows the lore of kneecap, how they got together, what their goals are, what they attempt to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=0.0s)]
*  do. And it was amazing. It was an amazing movie to watch. Now, obviously part of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  reason why I finally watched it was because I am going to be hanging out with the boys. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=11.34s)]
*  And I think it's good for me to do a little bit of research, right? Like to figure out [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=19.3s)]
*  what they're all about, right? What their story is, what their lore is, which is really [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=24.14s)]
*  cool on top of everything else. It was shockingly good. Like I will say it was shockingly good. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=33.74s)]
*  Shockingly. I had no idea. The like I, I am not very knowledgeable over like the Irish [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=42.34s)]
*  language. Like I didn't know anything about it other than, you know, Chuckie our law. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=52.9s)]
*  That's like the only thing I know. Right. And maybe a couple of select phrases that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=58.739999999999995s)]
*  I've heard, but I didn't realize that it was like, there was, it was like on its way out [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=62.98s)]
*  almost, you know what I mean? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=69.18s)]
*  So a big part of what kneecap does a big part of what kneecap is, is seeking out to do is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=70.74s)]
*  make the Irish Gaelic not a lost language. And the only way that it has the only way [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  that it has survived is because Irish people are stubborn enough, despite the fact that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  it was made illegal. They are, they were stubborn enough to just keep talking. And it seems [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=88.82s)]
*  like there's 60 or there's 80,000 at the time there's 80,000 people and only 6,000 in the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=94.08s)]
*  of Ireland. And, you know, they, we don't call it Gaelic. We call it Irish. Gaelic is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=100.38s)]
*  a sport. Irish is a language. Okay. I'm talking to Americans. I'm going to, I'm going to, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=107.82s)]
*  I'm going to Brian trans winter Pog. Stop telling me that there's a historical fencing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=114.1s)]
*  club in LA that I should check out. I'm probably not going to check it out. Okay. So it's, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=121.22s)]
*  it's Irish. It's the language is Irish, but kneecap wraps in Irish and, and a part of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=126.9s)]
*  the reason please unplug it. I can't, it's the road caster. That's like causing this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=136.74s)]
*  beeping to take place. I'm going to try to turn off the administrative sound, I guess, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=142.82s)]
*  but I don't know where to even turn off the, the beeps and whatnot. Oh, system sounds. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=149.5s)]
*  Okay. Muted it. All right. We won't hear it anymore. It's not a loose cable chat. So [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=155.18s)]
*  I'll have to, I'll have to work on that later. But we're good for the time being. Okay. So, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=160.9s)]
*  all right. So the music is still fine. Just the beeps and the boos and the system sound [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  old. Well, it was, is fine. The pronunciation is guala. He guala G guala. He that how you [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  pronounce it. I can't tell if you guys are from here or not. Anyway. My point is British [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=181.14s)]
*  occupied Ireland historically made it illegal and there's not a lot of native speakers of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=189.33999999999997s)]
*  it. And it's a language that is slated for extinction alongside many indigenous languages [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=196.26s)]
*  around the world. So there are a lot of people in Ireland that want to, you know, keep speaking [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  Irish and make it more common. And there's like language rights as a language rights [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  as well. That is an issue. And the kneecap historic fiction, I guess, covers all of that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=215.14s)]
*  and talks about like the real story. And I assume a lot of fictitious elements are added [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  on for, for a seasoning to make it like really interesting and really fun. Shows the lore [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=233.52s)]
*  of kneecap, how they got together, what their goals are, what they attempt to do. And it [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=239.36s)]
*  was amazing. It was an amazing movie to watch. Now, obviously part of the reason why I finally [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=245.68s)]
*  watched it was because I am going to be hanging out with the boys. And I think it's good for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=250.66000000000003s)]
*  me to do a little bit of research, right? Like to figure out what they're all about, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=259.2s)]
*  right? What their story is, what their lore is, what kind of drugs they're into, you know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=263.8s)]
*  like what, what, what am I, what am I looking forward to on Friday? Because hold on there, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=270.06s)]
*  DMing me right now actually. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=277.68s)]
*  But yeah, the reason why, of course I wanted to figure all this stuff out is because, because [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=280.08s)]
*  yeah, we're gonna, we're going to be doing, we're going to be collabing on Friday at Coachella, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=287.02s)]
*  you know? So very exciting stuff. Spilled the tea. How was sinners? Sinners was great. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  I talked about it. I talked about it yesterday. I watched sinners on Monday night. Please [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=298.5s)]
*  actually go to Ireland at some point. Yes, I would love to. It's ironic because like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=304.78s)]
*  a lot of this started when I saw this, when I saw them post this and I was like, Oh, these [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=309.46s)]
*  guys are like, I've already always known that the coolest type of white person is an Irish [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=315.94s)]
*  person. Okay. This is like not even a joke. It's just Irish people carry white people [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=321.68s)]
*  in general across the board. Okay. They've always been historically on the right side [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=328.74s)]
*  of issues for obvious reasons, considering that they are smack dab in the heart of the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=334.26s)]
*  colonial empire, England, due to their proximity. And they have a long history of resisting [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=342.0s)]
*  against colonial occupation. So they're pretty dope. The Scottish would like a word law. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=351.6s)]
*  Listen, don't. There's very cool Scottish people as well. But I think there is a little [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=356.76s)]
*  bit of a difference between the historic relation, Ireland versus England in comparison [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=363.64s)]
*  to the historic relationship of Scotland versus England, especially when considering that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=372.18s)]
*  the the Scots or let's just say, how can I, how can I put this gently loyal servants of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=378.94s)]
*  empire at many points? I think that like Braveheart did a really brave heart, did a number [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=389.26000000000005s)]
*  on Scottish propaganda in general, where a lot of people have this, this attitude that, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=396.02000000000004s)]
*  that like Scottish people across the board have a similar history of resistance. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  And they have their, there is historic resistance there as well. And they're not, and they're [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  significantly better than England right now. But, you know, there is a little bit of, if [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=416.22s)]
*  you look at the colonial history, there's complicity there for sure. Don't get mad. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=422.42s)]
*  I think Scottish people are very cool as well anyway. But this is why I say Irish people [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=427.66s)]
*  carry white folk in general. Okay. So yeah, just look at E fat. Oh, it's cause of the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=432.70000000000005s)]
*  picked ourselves is vastly more progressive than the rest of the UK when it's only a really [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=439.26000000000005s)]
*  tiny matter of degree. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. So anyway, listen, my point was these guys [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=443.74s)]
*  are dope kneecap is awesome. And the, I was shocked at how good they are at acting. Okay. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=451.66s)]
*  That's number one. It was, they're so phenomenal because they play themselves in the movie [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=460.86s)]
*  and they're so good. And I was also doubly shocked at like how well put together the, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  the movie is like they're musicians. Why are they so good at making a movie as well? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=475.41999999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? That was my, like, I did not expect it to be as good as, as it was like, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=481.34s)]
*  they very clearly have a aesthetic preference that is, is dope. I mean, even when you look at like [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=486.21999999999997s)]
*  their marketing in general, how they market themselves general, like they have the, the, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=492.86s)]
*  the peeler wagon that they drive around with, where they have on top of the peeler wagon, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=496.94s)]
*  the, the Irish flag and the Palestinian flag, like they go over in that it's pretty sick. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=503.5s)]
*  Anyway. Yeah. I, I started calling cops peelers now. That's, that's what is one of the coolest [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=511.74s)]
*  things that I learned. But yeah, they're, they're very cool. They're, they're very cool. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=517.9s)]
*  They're very dope and they like the party. And it was, it was just an incredible movie. I really [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=525.1s)]
*  think that Mo Medica says it has one of the best fictionalized representations of a drug trip ever. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=532.22s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. It's just very good. It was a very good, very well-rounded, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=537.26s)]
*  uh, very good, very well-rounded movie. I highly recommend it. Hassan fangirling a little bit. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=545.9s)]
*  Um, yeah, a little bit for sure anyway, but we're, we're going to see what we can do on Friday at [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=552.14s)]
*  Coachella. Uh, I am going to try to make something happen that I think you guys will consider to be [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=558.62s)]
*  very cool. So that's where I'm working on. That's what I'm working on right now. Wasn't control [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=566.4599999999999s)]

*  Will made fun of your Coachella questions. I don't know what my Coachella questions were, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=581.02s)]
*  but yeah, anyway, that's what I was like working on. That's what I was working on last night. And [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=585.82s)]

*  when to go work out, when to go do my thing as always. And, uh, here's what, uh, here, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSy6VCdyrE&t=596.6999999999999s)]
