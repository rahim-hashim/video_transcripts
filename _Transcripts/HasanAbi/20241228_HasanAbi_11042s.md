# Hasan And LolOverruled Helping The Homeless | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A)
*  Maybe to zero. That would help a lot. That would be really nice, but you know, we'll have to work on that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=0.0s)]
*  I feel bad I didn't get your pants. You want this jacket? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Um, you've given me enough already. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. Here you go. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10.0s)]
*  Oh, that is so generous. You're gonna make me cry. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=12.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. It's cancer. Cancer behavior. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=15.0s)]
*  Chances will do that. Well, the June cancers are different places. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=18.0s)]
*  Alright. That should be good. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=30.0s)]
*  Are we on? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=37.0s)]
*  I think we are. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=39.0s)]
*  Hey, Marsh. Hey, Chad. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=41.0s)]
*  Alright. You look comfy back there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=43.0s)]
*  It's my stream now. Yeah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=45.0s)]
*  Alright, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=47.0s)]
*  We are currently on a journey through the treacherous Los Angeles streets [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=49.0s)]
*  to make our way to a retail store that I will not be naming [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=55.0s)]
*  in order to purchase some much needed things for the on-house population of Skid Row. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=68.0s)]
*  As you guys know, we've talked about it quite extensively, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=76.0s)]
*  but homelessness has arisen in the United States of America year over year, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=80.0s)]
*  and this past year was especially bad. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=85.0s)]
*  18% increase in the on-house population in the United States of America, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=88.0s)]
*  and now the number is more than 700,000. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=94.0s)]
*  That means in the wealthiest nation on earth, the wealthiest nation throughout history, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=97.0s)]
*  we have 700,000 people that are going to be sleeping outside tonight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=103.0s)]
*  And every other night after tonight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=109.0s)]
*  Now, a big part of this problem, a major issue here, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=113.0s)]
*  is that unfortunately people are priced out of the housing market [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=119.0s)]
*  and go on their own journey into becoming homeless. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=125.0s)]
*  And today we're going to be going to one of the most documented, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=133.0s)]
*  perhaps in the worst ways possible usually, areas in Los Angeles, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=139.0s)]
*  a city that has some of the highest density of homeless people in the entire nation, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=145.0s)]
*  if not the entire planet as a matter of fact. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=152.0s)]
*  Actually, I don't know the exact numbers on that, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=155.0s)]
*  but I'm sure that our friend Sade from Waterdrop LA will be able to help us [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=158.0s)]
*  with some of that information, and I'll fact check it as well when I'm not driving. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=163.0s)]
*  But of course, I am a safe driver first and foremost. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=167.0s)]
*  Very responsible. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=172.0s)]
*  Very responsible, 10s and 2s the entire time, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=173.0s)]
*  and not simply because of Twitch restrictions, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=176.0s)]
*  but also because that's just how I am. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=181.0s)]
*  If you noticed, there's also bags and bags of clothes back there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=184.0s)]
*  Those are some of my clothes. I mean, they're all my clothes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=189.0s)]
*  Funny enough, not the most cramped I've ever been in your backseat. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah, because we're in the Camry. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=195.0s)]
*  It's very spacious. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=197.0s)]
*  It's actually spacious compared to the other. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=199.0s)]
*  2010 Toyota Camry Sport Edition V6 with the heated leather seats. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=201.0s)]
*  Just so you understand, I am a Toyota man forever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=205.0s)]
*  This is a little bit of a secret, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=215.0s)]
*  but I'm planning on getting a gift for my little bro as well. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=217.0s)]
*  The gift of a Toyota. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=225.0s)]
*  You know, since he's getting married, he's going to have kids. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=231.0s)]
*  I want him to have a reliable, affordable, good gas mileage vehicle. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=235.0s)]
*  That's really kind of you to do that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=247.0s)]
*  Why are you saying it like that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=250.0s)]
*  I'm not. What do you mean? I'm just saying that's very kind. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=252.0s)]
*  There's always a tone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=254.0s)]
*  There's always a tone you take. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=257.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=259.0s)]
*  Just this sarcastic tone you take with me. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=260.0s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=264.0s)]
*  No matter. Okay. I feel like you're still doing it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=266.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=269.0s)]
*  Did you push your fly back already? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=270.0s)]
*  No, I'm going to do that tonight. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=272.0s)]
*  You won't be able to interview me if you don't push your fly back. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. Okay. Don't worry. It's going to happen. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=277.0s)]
*  I told you you could stay for longer if you want. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=280.0s)]
*  No, I'm not going to stay. I don't want to overstay my welcome. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=282.0s)]
*  You're not overstaying your welcome. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=285.0s)]
*  No, Marsh, what do you think? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=287.0s)]
*  It kind of feels like you're overstaying your welcome. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=291.0s)]
*  Alright, well, Marsh is the authority here. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=294.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=297.0s)]
*  And if he says it, then I'm crazy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=299.0s)]
*  It's kind of awkward, but I thought we were on the same team here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=301.0s)]
*  What the f***? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=307.0s)]
*  Flip the camera to yourself too. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=308.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=310.0s)]
*  When you're talking. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=311.0s)]
*  Oh, hi, Chad. I am ashamed. I don't like being on camera. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=312.0s)]
*  Oh, wonderful. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=315.0s)]
*  Camera's just for you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=317.0s)]
*  LA traffic. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=318.0s)]
*  I said in the chat the other day, two months is the... [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=320.0s)]
*  Remember? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=322.0s)]
*  Two months is f***ing easy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=323.0s)]
*  That's f***ing nuts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=325.0s)]
*  That's what the Aussies do when they come, and I love it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=326.0s)]
*  I mean, they are coming from really far away. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=330.0s)]
*  New York is really far away too. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=333.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the Australia of the United States. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=335.0s)]
*  New York, the Melbourne of America. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=338.0s)]
*  Oh, Eric Adams. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=343.0s)]
*  My king. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=345.0s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. LA traffic simulator. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's... [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=349.0s)]
*  That's a given. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=352.0s)]
*  Ew, Cybertruck, ew! [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=353.0s)]
*  They've lost like 50 grand off the sticker price now in value. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=358.0s)]
*  Apparently there's so many complications that people are just no longer purchasing them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=363.0s)]
*  Finally, it took this long. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=370.0s)]
*  All the assholes bought them and ran them into the ground, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=372.0s)]
*  finding out how awful, how dog-s*** car it is. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=377.0s)]
*  So now, people are not buying them anymore, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=381.0s)]
*  especially because it takes very long apparently to fix them up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=384.0s)]
*  Were you looking into getting one? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=391.0s)]
*  F*** no. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=393.0s)]
*  I genuinely despise Teslas. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=394.0s)]
*  It's one of the only cars you can die in though, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=399.0s)]
*  with the doors locked and you get set on fire. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=402.0s)]
*  It's pretty sick. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=405.0s)]
*  It's pretty sick. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=407.0s)]
*  It is a pretty metal way to go about it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=408.0s)]
*  If you're into that kind of thing. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=412.0s)]
*  What is even this... I don't even understand why there's traffic here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=414.0s)]
*  Like, this makes no sense whatsoever. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=418.0s)]
*  Why is there no good public transportation in LA, Hassan? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=421.0s)]
*  What do you mean? We have way more. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=425.0s)]
*  Oh, you're right. Sorry, my bad. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=428.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=430.0s)]
*  That's the public transport of Los Angeles. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=431.0s)]
*  Oh, I want to die. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=434.0s)]
*  In a Tesla. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=438.0s)]
*  Why is there no good public transit in Los Angeles? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=440.0s)]
*  Los Angeles, much like many large metropolitan cities in the United States of America, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=443.0s)]
*  has car-reliant infrastructure. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=447.0s)]
*  Los Angeles actually historically used to have a very active and relatively robust tram system, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=449.0s)]
*  until the car companies bought out all the tram cars [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=455.0s)]
*  and then discontinued them in an effort to make this city even more car-reliant than it already was. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=459.0s)]
*  People often think, oh, it's because Los Angeles is so vast and it's so expansive [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=466.0s)]
*  and it's across such a large geographical area, and that's not the real reason. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=472.0s)]
*  There are many very vast networks all around the planet where countries that are actually local governments [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=478.0s)]
*  that are dedicated to governance and improving the lives of its citizens [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=484.0s)]
*  and don't want traffic congestion, or maybe even care about the environment [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=488.0s)]
*  and care about commerce, have created walkable cities with robust public transit options. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=493.0s)]
*  Public transit is the only thing that actually eliminates traffic density. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=500.0s)]
*  The one more extra lane mentality that American dumbasses have is a demonstrable failure, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=505.0s)]
*  as evidenced by those very famous viral videos that go viral every holiday season in Los Angeles, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=512.0s)]
*  as a matter of fact, where you look at the LA Highway 405, 101, and the like, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=519.0s)]
*  and there are just a s*** ton of cars and bumper-to-bumper traffic, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=523.0s)]
*  even though there are eight-plus lanes on the highway. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=527.0s)]
*  Additional lanes do not work. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=533.0s)]
*  Traffic congestion occurs at the point of going back into the city. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=536.0s)]
*  There's bottlenecks. You can't have eight-lane exits, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=542.0s)]
*  which would then require to have eight-lane city streets. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=547.0s)]
*  Oh my god, we're gonna have eight-lane city streets, I think. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=552.0s)]
*  That's gonna be sick, dude. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=555.0s)]
*  Oh my god. Those would be pedestrian safe. That'll be sick. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=557.0s)]
*  You'll get vaporized if you do. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=560.0s)]
*  He's gonna fix it? The tunnels are coming, man. He's gonna fix it. Oh, hell yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=563.0s)]
*  Oh, Yulan? Yeah. He's gonna fix it. Don't worry. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=567.0s)]
*  Another valid reason to f***ing despise him. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=570.0s)]
*  Marsh, what do you think about these UFOs? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=575.0s)]
*  It's real. It's real? Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=579.0s)]
*  What are they hiding? What are they hiding? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=581.0s)]
*  What is the government hiding? And what does Joe Rogan know? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=583.0s)]
*  Oh, s***. He knows. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=586.0s)]
*  Don't flip the camera back to me. You need to go on Joe Rogan. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=588.0s)]
*  Ask him about the UFOs. Ask him about the UFOs, Hasan. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=591.0s)]
*  Don't flip the camera back to me for that, please. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=594.0s)]
*  Hasan, we were just talking about this. You were like, oh, f***ing hell, dude. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=596.0s)]
*  I really want to go work out with Joe Rogan. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=599.0s)]
*  And then the media was covering it. I've never said that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=602.0s)]
*  The news media. The news media. The real news media. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=605.0s)]
*  Dexterity. That's news. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=608.0s)]
*  Is anything but the real news media. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=611.0s)]
*  Institution. That's on par with the New York Times. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=614.0s)]
*  I mean... I mean that sincerely. Yeah, I was gonna say... [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=619.0s)]
*  Yeah, New York Times is in the garbage, you know, this past year especially, so... [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=623.0s)]
*  Where they have kind of shown their hands a little bit. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=629.0s)]
*  Maybe went a little heavy-handed on the propaganda. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=633.0s)]
*  Did you see that? There was another Israel article that came out where they were talking about the slain journalist. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=636.0s)]
*  And it just literally read like a Israeli Defense Force PR piece. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=641.0s)]
*  Straight up. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=649.0s)]
*  Not surprising. Yeah, they were like... [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=651.0s)]
*  Five enemy combatants were slain for doing combat propaganda or some shit. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=655.0s)]
*  It was f***ing insane. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=660.0s)]
*  Thank you, New York Times. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=664.0s)]
*  For being the most trusted name in news. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=668.0s)]
*  Alright, we're almost there, Chad. Yeah, we're close. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=675.0s)]
*  We're almost at the unnamed location. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=678.0s)]
*  Box chain retail store. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=681.0s)]
*  Is Saadi gonna meet us there? Yeah, she'll be there. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=685.0s)]
*  And some other people from Water Drop will also be there. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=694.0s)]
*  Nice. Oh, God. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=699.0s)]
*  I'm harrowing. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=703.0s)]
*  This is the only... I hate going to big malls where you just have to go underground and f***ing park the car. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=706.0s)]
*  Just sucks. There's no alternative. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=719.0s)]
*  I know. This is the best American experience. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=722.0s)]
*  Yeah, what do you mean? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=725.0s)]
*  People don't want public transit. They want their own cars. Don't you get it? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=727.0s)]
*  And more parking. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=732.0s)]
*  More parking lots. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=734.0s)]
*  We should bulldoze your house and put a parking lot there. I think that would be sick. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=736.0s)]
*  Yeah. Pave paradise and put up a parking lot. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=739.0s)]
*  How does it go? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=746.0s)]
*  It always seems to go. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=748.0s)]
*  You don't know what you got. Dilly is gone. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=750.0s)]
*  Pave paradise and put up a parking lot. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=753.0s)]
*  What, Marz? You're not even singing? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=760.0s)]
*  You gotta sing it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=762.0s)]
*  I don't know this one. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=763.0s)]
*  What? What the f***? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=765.0s)]
*  Mr. Einles in the music. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=767.0s)]
*  No Ablo in English. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=770.0s)]
*  Oh, that was the line from the car? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=772.0s)]
*  You're gonna Ablo in English later. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=773.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. Now I was also racist today? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=775.0s)]
*  I'm Latina. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=778.0s)]
*  I broke BDS and I also was racist against Marz. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=780.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=784.0s)]
*  It's fine. I punish him sometimes by making him eat bad Mexican food in places like Australia and Japan. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=786.0s)]
*  Yeah, that does pretty good. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=793.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=795.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be admitting to that on camera. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=796.0s)]
*  Yeah, no. I mean, we literally, I made you eat it on camera. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=798.0s)]
*  I don't even know if this is the right... [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=802.0s)]
*  We might lose you guys in this. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=804.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're going underground. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=806.0s)]
*  We're going underground. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=808.0s)]
*  You're a big beautiful parking structure. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=809.0s)]
*  Oh my God. I love it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=810.0s)]
*  Oh, please. Please more parking. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=812.0s)]
*  Oh, I f***ing love it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=816.0s)]
*  Is this even the right mall? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=818.0s)]
*  I don't know. You use the GPS. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=820.0s)]
*  I know, but not well. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=822.0s)]
*  I've never been to this lot or been at this mall before, so... [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=824.0s)]
*  What did you put in the... [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=829.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=831.0s)]
*  I put the f***ing the place, dude. What do you mean? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=832.0s)]
*  Are we even... [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=836.0s)]
*  Look at all these spots. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=838.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know if this is the right... [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=840.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know if it's the closest. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=842.0s)]
*  Wait, maybe there's an upstairs. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=846.0s)]
*  There's a f***ing line, dude. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=851.0s)]
*  There is literally a line. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=854.0s)]
*  There is literally a traffic jam in the parking lot. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=856.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Killme. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=865.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. This is what it's all about right here. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=870.0s)]
*  This is the American experience. This is the dream. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=873.0s)]
*  Ironically enough, this also contributes to homelessness as well. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=876.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=880.0s)]
*  What? How? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=882.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=884.0s)]
*  When you have a car with line infrastructure, you have to build vast parking lots [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=886.0s)]
*  that occupy a tremendous amount of space that can be utilized at the behest of affordable housing, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=890.0s)]
*  which obviously we're never going to do anyway. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=897.0s)]
*  I don't know how well this car can take a hill. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=901.0s)]
*  Oh my god, dude. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=903.0s)]
*  I don't know how well... [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=905.0s)]
*  Listen, old Bertha, old reliable, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=907.0s)]
*  she's been with me for many years through thick and thin. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=912.0s)]
*  She's not doing a good job of getting up this hill right now. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=916.0s)]
*  She's doing a wonderful job. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=918.0s)]
*  She's doing a fantastic job. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=921.0s)]
*  This old bitch. I'm going to replace her with a... [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=924.0s)]
*  Wait, is this it? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=928.0s)]
*  It doesn't look like the retail store that we're looking for is here. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=932.0s)]
*  Oh my... [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=936.0s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=938.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=941.0s)]
*  So we did... Oh no. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=943.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=947.0s)]
*  He's looking for smoke. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=949.0s)]
*  This dude with the busted Malibu. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=951.0s)]
*  Wait, where is it? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=953.0s)]
*  Can you look it up, Marge? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=955.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=957.0s)]
*  This is definitely not it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=961.0s)]
*  Oh my god, are they doing a pet giveaway? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=963.0s)]
*  Oh! [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=966.0s)]
*  Hold on, I want to... [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=968.0s)]
*  Can we adopt a cat? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=970.0s)]
*  Chad, can we adopt a cat? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=972.0s)]
*  Chad's cat. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=974.0s)]
*  It said it's supposed to be right here to your left. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=976.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I thought. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=980.0s)]
*  I wonder if it turned into this store. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=982.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=986.0s)]
*  It's not updated. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=988.0s)]
*  It might be downstairs, maybe multiple floors. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=990.0s)]
*  There's no downstairs. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=992.0s)]
*  Downstairs is all parking garage. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=994.0s)]
*  Can you call a second? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=998.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1000.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1004.0s)]
*  We can get him stuff from Bath and Body Works. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1006.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'll love that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1008.0s)]
*  I mean, sanitation wipes and stuff are definitely good to hand out. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1012.0s)]
*  I'm looking to put the entrance up. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1022.0s)]
*  Cool. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1024.0s)]
*  We are like five minutes ago. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1028.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1030.0s)]
*  Have you been here before? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1032.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1034.0s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1036.0s)]
*  Is it on top of a parking garage? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1038.0s)]
*  Oh, I see it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1042.0s)]
*  Oh my god, that's so far away. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1044.0s)]
*  We found it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1046.0s)]
*  Google Maps is... [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1048.0s)]
*  Okay, we'll be there in a minute. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1050.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1052.0s)]
*  Thank god for that sign. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1054.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1056.0s)]
*  That's insane that it's so... [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1058.0s)]
*  It's not even in the same complex. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1060.0s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1064.0s)]
*  It's an entirely separate structure. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1066.0s)]
*  Why the fuck did it take us here? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1068.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1072.0s)]
*  It doesn't have the best shock absorbers. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1074.0s)]
*  This old Bertha. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1076.0s)]
*  Old, old faithful. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1078.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm seeing Lowe's shit right there. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1080.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's for them. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1084.0s)]
*  Wait, no, it says Lowe's. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1086.0s)]
*  Look, the sign points in this direction. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1088.0s)]
*  That's even more confusing. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1090.0s)]
*  Maybe it's bottom, bottom, bottom ground floor. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1092.0s)]
*  Docked, docked, docked. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1096.0s)]
*  Wait, shit. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1098.0s)]
*  Oh, oh. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1100.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1102.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1104.0s)]
*  Yeah, I never doubted for a second. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1108.0s)]
*  I never doubted for a second. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1110.0s)]
*  Just park it, maybe. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1112.0s)]
*  No, this is garden center. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1114.0s)]
*  Maybe it's the indoor lumber yard only. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1116.0s)]
*  And the other Lowe's is back there. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1118.0s)]
*  That might be true. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1120.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1122.0s)]
*  This does only say lumber garden garden center. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1124.0s)]
*  I mean, isn't that where we get the tarps though? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1126.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1128.0s)]
*  Oh, it's right there. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1132.0s)]
*  This is fucking Lowe's. Jesus Christ. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1134.0s)]
*  Entrance. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1136.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, just the normal... [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1138.0s)]
*  ...park this thing. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1140.0s)]
*  Spit on that sign. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1142.0s)]
*  Oh God, I was gonna... [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1144.0s)]
*  I literally was holding myself back from saying... [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1146.0s)]
*  I'm worried about her. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1148.0s)]
*  You're worried about Hayley Welch? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1150.0s)]
*  Hayley Welch? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1152.0s)]
*  And I think she should go on Fortnite Friday. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1154.0s)]
*  I think she should go on Fear and. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1156.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, obviously, but let's be honest. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1158.0s)]
*  We don't have the power that Fortnite Friday has? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1160.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1162.0s)]
*  I mean, I didn't want to say it, but you said it. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1164.0s)]
*  I feel like she would go on. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1166.0s)]
*  I can, you know, give flowers to competing podcasts without diminishing. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1168.0s)]
*  Fortnite Friday is not a podcast. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1172.0s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1174.0s)]
*  I agree to disagree. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1176.0s)]
*  It's more than a podcast. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1178.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1180.0s)]
*  It's a dream. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1182.0s)]
*  You're just gonna leave this out? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1184.0s)]
*  Well, put it in the console, dude. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1186.0s)]
*  Or take it... [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1188.0s)]
*  You want to take it? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1190.0s)]
*  Come here, children. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1192.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1194.0s)]
*  Do you like film? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1202.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1204.0s)]
*  Film film is improving our homes. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1206.0s)]
*  Why are the cables all twisted? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1210.0s)]
*  What do you mean? I didn't do shit. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1212.0s)]
*  Sorry, Chad. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1218.0s)]
*  I also have to pee. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1220.0s)]
*  I also have to pee. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1222.0s)]

*  Lolo, what? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1228.0s)]
*  I didn't do anything. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1230.0s)]
*  Do we have bars in here? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1232.0s)]
*  Yeah, you want me to spit some right now? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1234.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, we got it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1236.0s)]
*  We're good. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1238.0s)]
*  We're just talking about... [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1242.0s)]
*  They're not laughing, but I know Chad has kicked W right now. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1248.0s)]
*  That's the exit. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1252.0s)]
*  Well, you can't get in through the exit. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1256.0s)]
*  It serves the same purpose as the door. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1258.0s)]
*  Yeah, what's up? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1260.0s)]

*  Ready to purchase a bunch of [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1322.0s)]
*  a bunch of [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1324.0s)]
*  things that we need to purchase [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1326.0s)]
*  to take over to Skid Row. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1328.0s)]
*  It seems that Tarps is one of the most [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1334.0s)]
*  commonly requested items. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1336.0s)]
*  And we'll see if there's anything else [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1338.0s)]
*  on top of Tarps that we can get as well. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1340.0s)]
*  Maybe if they have hand warmers, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1342.0s)]
*  I've heard that that's like important. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1344.0s)]
*  No? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1346.0s)]

*  While Lolo mans the stream? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1370.0s)]

*  Wow. That was the last time we ever saw his sign. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1384.0s)]
*  Yeah, he used to pee, guys, so [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1388.0s)]
*  now I guess it's all on me. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1390.0s)]
*  You got this. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1392.0s)]
*  The views are gonna plummet precipitously. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1394.0s)]
*  I'm a little out of focus. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1396.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1398.0s)]
*  I'll do a great start here. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1400.0s)]
*  Oh, there's the Waterdrop people. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1402.0s)]

*  People will take as big as you want to go. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1742.0s)]
*  But it's just harder. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1744.0s)]
*  The bigger ones are possible. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1746.0s)]
*  It's been my experience that folks usually [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1748.0s)]
*  what matters more is the density of the material. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1750.0s)]
*  Because these [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1752.0s)]
*  with wear and tear eventually [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1754.0s)]
*  things start tearing. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1756.0s)]
*  These are heavy duty enough? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1758.0s)]
*  No, this is a reversible tarp. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1760.0s)]
*  People will use it for anything. People sleep on [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1762.0s)]
*  tarps. They put them over themselves. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1764.0s)]
*  They'll use them as blankets. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1766.0s)]
*  It's like a full... [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1768.0s)]
*  Is there like a heavier duty 8x10? I feel like this is [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1770.0s)]
*  like the little [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1772.0s)]
*  6x8. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1776.0s)]
*  That's huge. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1778.0s)]
*  Um. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1780.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1782.0s)]
*  What is this one? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1784.0s)]

*  There we go. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1798.0s)]
*  Because somebody [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1800.0s)]
*  messed with the wires. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1802.0s)]

*  It's cool. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1806.0s)]
*  It's not my fault. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1808.0s)]
*  It's not my fault. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1810.0s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1812.0s)]
*  What about bungee cords? Should we get bungee cords too? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1814.0s)]
*  I'm going to get the high end. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1816.0s)]
*  People love these ones. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1818.0s)]

*  Um. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1824.0s)]
*  Probably? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1826.0s)]
*  I'll get another one. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1828.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1830.0s)]
*  You can say whatever you want. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1832.0s)]
*  I'm just going to get another cart. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1834.0s)]
*  Lolo's getting one. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1836.0s)]
*  Um. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1838.0s)]
*  I just took off the duty roof rack. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1840.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1846.0s)]
*  Oh I see what [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1852.0s)]
*  there is. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1854.0s)]
*  I'm looking for zip ties. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1858.0s)]
*  I don't know where to find zip ties though. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1860.0s)]
*  I'll ask. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1862.0s)]
*  Do you think we have enough? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yeah you'll get rid of all that. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1866.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1868.0s)]
*  Or is it not enough? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1870.0s)]
*  You can be honest. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1872.0s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1874.0s)]
*  The unfortunate reality is you're never going to meet everyone's needs. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1876.0s)]
*  So we could give out tarps [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1878.0s)]
*  every day indefinitely [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1880.0s)]
*  and people are continuing to come in. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1882.0s)]
*  We also find that there are a lot of people who are being [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1884.0s)]
*  tossed in right now. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1886.0s)]
*  So there are a lot of people who have tried to migrate to this country [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1888.0s)]
*  who have been left in skid row. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1890.0s)]
*  So we have people coming in every day. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1892.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1894.0s)]
*  It's pretty absurd. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1896.0s)]
*  So no like [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1898.0s)]
*  the water we give out is gone [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1900.0s)]
*  in less than two hours. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1902.0s)]
*  Every week. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1904.0s)]
*  So you cannot take it upon yourself. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1906.0s)]
*  What about the value pack? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1908.0s)]
*  This 20 piece one. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1910.0s)]
*  You'll give anything out. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1912.0s)]
*  You'll give anything out. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1914.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1916.0s)]
*  No like people will pull the stuff out of the sides of my car. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1918.0s)]
*  People love to grab [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1920.0s)]
*  like my selfie as I have the back seat. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1922.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1924.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1926.0s)]
*  Alright we [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1928.0s)]
*  toss it in there. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1930.0s)]
*  Alright this is going to be hard to load. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1932.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1934.0s)]
*  Well you guys are going to have to do the loading part. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1936.0s)]

*  Okay. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1944.0s)]
*  Did you put anything in the trunk? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1946.0s)]
*  Yeah it's full. Oh the trunk is full too? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1948.0s)]
*  I mean we can probably like squeeze these [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1950.0s)]
*  in different places. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1952.0s)]
*  No no do you guys have a seat? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1954.0s)]
*  No. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1956.0s)]
*  We can stack on top of ourselves. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1958.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1960.0s)]

*  And see if there's any sanitation products. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1970.0s)]
*  Do y'all want to man that one? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1972.0s)]
*  I'll do it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=1974.0s)]

*  He gets nervous on stream. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2004.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think we're going to be able to find it ourselves. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2006.0s)]
*  I know but he's working with someone and I don't want to disrupt him. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2013.0s)]
*  This baby right here. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2018.0s)]

*  Zip ties on aisle 12, sanitation products on aisle 1. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2065.0s)]
*  So yeah, in terms of sanitation products, I was asking, is it self-cleaning wipes or are we talking to wipe stuff off surfaces? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2079.0s)]
*  People want like bath wipes and they don't tend to have that here. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2088.0s)]
*  They tend to have like surface cleaning which we don't like to promote for... [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2091.0s)]
*  What you got there? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2096.0s)]
*  Is that to mask shame me? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2099.0s)]
*  Well, we need to buy it first. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2102.0s)]
*  And I have colored fun ones in the car. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2105.0s)]
*  Oh, she's got fun ones. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2108.0s)]

*  Okay. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2128.0s)]
*  Why are you so scared to be on stream, bro? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2129.0s)]
*  That's where you ran off to. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2135.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2137.0s)]
*  I have a grill. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2138.0s)]
*  This won't work, right? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2140.0s)]
*  No, no, we're chilling on these things. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2141.0s)]
*  Antibacterial hand wipes? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2145.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2147.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2148.0s)]
*  Love it. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2150.0s)]
*  Wait, what are you getting now? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2157.0s)]
*  Antibacterial hand wipes. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2158.0s)]
*  Oh, perfect. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2159.0s)]
*  What about a toilet paper stuff, you know? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2166.0s)]
*  We'll take toilet paper, actually. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2168.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2170.0s)]
*  Actually, it just takes so much space. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2173.0s)]
*  Okay, never mind. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2176.0s)]
*  But in general, yes. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2177.0s)]
*  In general chat, yes, for toilet paper. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2180.0s)]
*  But right now we have a limited amount of space, so we're not going to do it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2182.0s)]
*  And then let's go to aisle 15, or 12. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2190.0s)]
*  12, yeah. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2193.0s)]
*  The balancing act of not pointing a camera at strangers while still trying to make chat not throw up. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2206.0s)]
*  You're doing a great job, Mark. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2211.0s)]

*  What about batteries? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2231.0s)]
*  No. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2234.0s)]
*  I mean, sometimes I get like, erratic battery requests. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2237.0s)]
*  I thought he was going for the dog. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2248.0s)]
*  I was like, bro can't help himself. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2250.0s)]
*  Dude, he's drinking a fucking Mountain Dew. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2254.0s)]

*  Oh, for sure. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2263.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2270.0s)]
*  Eat my Mountain Dew, baby. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2271.0s)]
*  That's what I'm handing out in Mountain Dew. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2274.0s)]
*  Alright, let's do this. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2280.0s)]
*  Oh, dog toys. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2281.0s)]
*  Apparently, people have pets, so we're getting some dog toys and dog treats. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2282.0s)]
*  Is that good? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2288.0s)]

*  We're getting the zip ties. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2294.0s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2313.0s)]
*  No. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2314.0s)]

*  So what about what? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2323.0s)]
*  That's not. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2327.0s)]
*  I know this aisle well. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2328.0s)]
*  Do you? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2330.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2331.0s)]
*  Zip ties. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2332.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2333.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you know. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2334.0s)]

*  Heavily, like that? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2343.0s)]
*  Why are you making fun of me man? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2344.0s)]
*  I'm trying my best here. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2345.0s)]
*  What? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2346.0s)]
*  Did you hear him? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2347.0s)]
*  Do you get a replay on that, man? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2348.0s)]
*  You didn't say that word, though. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2351.0s)]
*  You said something else. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2354.0s)]
*  That's a duty. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2355.0s)]
*  It's getting intense. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2356.0s)]
*  What did you hear? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2357.0s)]
*  Did we get a replay on that one? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2359.0s)]
*  You didn't say that word though, you said something else. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2361.0s)]
*  That's the duty. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2363.0s)]
*  Let's get an instant replay on that. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2365.0s)]
*  I'm trying to do something nice. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2369.0s)]
*  Why must you always [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2371.0s)]
*  minimize me? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2373.0s)]
*  I am but a man. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2375.0s)]
*  You guys, let's all clap for Hasan. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2377.0s)]
*  No, don't do that. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2379.0s)]
*  Stop, stop, never do that. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2381.0s)]
*  That's the ball we gotta hate you. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2383.0s)]
*  Okay, so these are the right ones, right? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2385.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're over thinking it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2387.0s)]
*  Okay, I wanna make sure [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2389.0s)]
*  that we get the best stuff. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2391.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the other issue [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2393.0s)]
*  is that things just degrade really fast. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2395.0s)]
*  You can buy the best tent [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2397.0s)]
*  and if you're living in it full time, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2399.0s)]
*  it's probably done in a month or two. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2401.0s)]
*  Well, even then, let's make sure that it runs [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2403.0s)]
*  for a month at least, you know? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2405.0s)]
*  Alright, what else do we need? What are we missing? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2407.0s)]
*  This is great. This is the largest house. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2415.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2417.0s)]
*  Yeah, you like that? Hell yeah. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2419.0s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2421.0s)]
*  But that's why I wanted to help as much as I can. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2423.0s)]
*  Alright, let's do this. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2425.0s)]
*  Duck tape? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2427.0s)]
*  Oh, we were back, there was a gorilla glue back. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2429.0s)]
*  Oh, there's duck tape here. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2431.0s)]
*  For... [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2433.0s)]
*  I'm actually surprised [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2435.0s)]
*  that they have it taken out. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2437.0s)]
*  How did you hear those guys talking about it? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2439.0s)]
*  I ever heard an employee get called [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2441.0s)]
*  about us. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2443.0s)]
*  And he was like, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2445.0s)]
*  they seem to be not bothering anybody, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2447.0s)]
*  I'm keeping an eye on them, but it seems chill. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2449.0s)]
*  That's sick. Is that what that was? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2451.0s)]
*  The guy who came in and kind of went out? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2455.0s)]
*  No, no, they can just have a hose. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2457.0s)]
*  Nah, brother, chill. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2459.0s)]
*  Oh, he's stealing! [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2461.0s)]
*  He's stealing in a really bad way. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2463.0s)]
*  No, it's worse, we need to unhouse the gold. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2465.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2467.0s)]
*  If they only knew. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2469.0s)]
*  Remember, John, this is [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=2471.0s)]

*  What's up, Leah? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4758.52s)]
*  All right. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4759.56s)]
*  All right, cool. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4762.280000000001s)]
*  Sit over here. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4764.84s)]
*  Okay, do you wanna sit? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4766.52s)]
*  Yeah, give me two seconds. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4768.4800000000005s)]
*  I think it's better if I hold it here. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4769.320000000001s)]
*  If that's okay. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4771.64s)]
*  It feels very formal. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4773.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4774.360000000001s)]
*  Sit here, sit here. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4775.52s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4777.84s)]
*  Sit over here, sit over here. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4778.68s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4779.52s)]
*  I don't wanna be behind you though. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4781.04s)]
*  All right, so I got a bunch of feastables [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4781.96s)]
*  and I'm gonna shove it in people's faces. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4784.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4786.48s)]
*  And I'm gonna say, do you like this? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4787.32s)]
*  Say you like this. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4788.4s)]
*  That's what people like, right? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4789.839999999999s)]
*  You pose with the person after and give a thumbs up. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4791.679999999999s)]
*  That's what they like. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4794.24s)]
*  And then I also have stacks of cash on our broad with me. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4795.08s)]
*  I'm gonna throw it in the air [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4798.32s)]
*  and try to get people to run after it. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4799.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, I know you say this as a joke. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4801.759999999999s)]
*  We have had people literally do that shit. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4804.32s)]
*  Yes, we should. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4806.2s)]
*  We've done, people have done that right here. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4807.2s)]
*  I forgot that I'm on camera. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4808.84s)]
*  I was about to say what I think we should do [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4810.64s)]
*  to people that do that. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4812.56s)]
*  But that would be a violation of the terms of service. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4813.92s)]
*  So I will not be saying it, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4816.28s)]
*  but you can't stop me from stinking it. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4817.68s)]
*  No, people do that. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4821.24s)]
*  Like we've had the people who came like dumped [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4822.08s)]
*  10 grand of cash in here once [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4823.72s)]
*  and then they like picked it back up. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4825.88s)]
*  Oh, they picked it back up. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4827.88s)]
*  Yeah, they picked it back up. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4828.72s)]
*  So we like do tend to find that like distros are pretty tough. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4829.64s)]
*  There obviously are a lot of people who make content [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4834.28s)]
*  down here. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4836.88s)]
*  We definitely struggle with what that should look like. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4838.16s)]
*  I'm sure people do in general of like wanting to be able [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4840.84s)]
*  to platform what's going on [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4843.72s)]
*  and have people tell their experience. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4844.84s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4846.599999999999s)]
*  No, they can hear you. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4847.44s)]
*  You're good. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4848.26s)]
*  Vibes. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4849.099999999999s)]
*  I was just checking. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4849.94s)]
*  Like wanting people to platform people, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4851.32s)]
*  but also wanting to be aware of autonomy and respect. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4852.68s)]
*  And so I guess for Waterdrop, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4855.5599999999995s)]
*  we usually do a whole brief of like, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4858.2s)]
*  we ask people not to photograph people's homes [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4860.36s)]
*  or themselves without consent. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4862.88s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4866.4s)]
*  This is distracting as hell. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4867.24s)]
*  You want ice cream? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4870.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4871.24s)]
*  No. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4872.08s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4873.28s)]
*  This place is pretty good. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4874.12s)]
*  We eat here a lot. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4874.94s)]
*  I also have a tab here that people get food out. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4875.78s)]
*  I don't eat seafood. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4877.12s)]
*  They have- [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4878.679999999999s)]
*  But it's okay. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4879.8s)]
*  I'm not hungry. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4880.639999999999s)]
*  Root 211 raspberries. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4881.46s)]
*  We tend to have people that not photograph. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4884.92s)]
*  What we will do when we go out is like, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4886.679999999999s)]
*  we'll distribute out of one side of the car [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4887.92s)]
*  so people can just grab stuff. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4889.96s)]
*  We'll let them know we're filming. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4891.12s)]
*  And if they don't want to be on camera [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4892.92s)]
*  to just grab stuff and go. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4894.2s)]
*  And then we have a couple of people [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4896.2s)]
*  who would like to talk about their experience [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4897.639999999999s)]
*  and what they've been through. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4899.92s)]
*  Great. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4900.92s)]
*  One, I'll let them talk more, but one is recently housed. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4902.0s)]
*  He just came inside with the program. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4905.12s)]
*  He actually came through. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4906.96s)]
*  I didn't go back out. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4908.32s)]
*  And then we have another who has been on the streets [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4909.16s)]
*  consistently since I've been out here. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4911.24s)]
*  I think it's been out for like eight years, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4913.48s)]
*  something like that. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4914.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4915.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4916.96s)]
*  What are our other usual masks? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4918.48s)]
*  Oh, we ask you to mask. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4920.599999999999s)]
*  And like people to mask in Skid Row in general. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4921.84s)]
*  It's a vulnerable population. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4923.28s)]
*  And I think most of us include in our own values [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4924.84s)]
*  that we mask. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4927.64s)]
*  And so we really want to make sure we're doing that [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4928.4800000000005s)]
*  down here. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4929.32s)]
*  Of course. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4930.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4931.0s)]
*  And then the other one is just like, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4931.84s)]
*  we're in public right of way. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4933.28s)]
*  So obviously people don't have walls. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4935.96s)]
*  I like to be like, hey, knock, knock, stuff like that. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4938.52s)]
*  Like all the basics as we go in [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4940.84s)]
*  to just be as respectful as possible. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4943.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4945.88s)]
*  I think that's about it. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4948.72s)]
*  Cool. All right. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4949.88s)]
*  And one more plug for Water Drop LA. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4950.72s)]
*  There's a link that people can donate to [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4953.68s)]
*  that's been going on the entire day. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4955.200000000001s)]
*  It's in the chat. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4957.04s)]
*  My mom's posted the link. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4957.88s)]
*  Oh, sweet. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4958.96s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4960.04s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4960.88s)]
*  Yeah, we're... [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4961.72s)]
*  Should we talk about the cost of the drop? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4962.54s)]
*  No. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4964.16s)]
*  Do you want to hear about it? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4965.0s)]
*  What? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4966.76s)]
*  How much we spend? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4967.6s)]
*  Sure. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4969.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4970.64s)]
*  So a regular drop costs us about $5,000 [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4971.4800000000005s)]
*  and that's mostly going to water. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4975.280000000001s)]
*  We also have partnership distributions that we do, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4977.4800000000005s)]
*  which is why this fundraising is really important [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4980.6s)]
*  because this is really expensive, honestly. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4982.84s)]
*  So we appreciate even, I don't know, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4985.400000000001s)]
*  it's like 22,000 people watching. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4987.400000000001s)]
*  And if you guys just donate $2, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4988.8s)]
*  we would really appreciate that. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4991.08s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4992.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4993.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'll tell you something. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4994.4800000000005s)]
*  We started, so we started in 2020 [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4995.32s)]
*  when people was like, cared about BLM, it felt. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=4998.04s)]
*  And so they accidentally raised like a ton of money [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5002.56s)]
*  on Venmo. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5005.12s)]
*  Accidentally? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5006.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5007.360000000001s)]
*  Basically like they were like, we're going to do water once [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5008.2s)]
*  because there's no water downtown [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5009.72s)]
*  and then raised like hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5011.32s)]
*  And then since then we've been like scrambling [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5013.88s)]
*  like most public work. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5017.36s)]
*  It's just like not, there's no funding for it [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5018.679999999999s)]
*  since it's not changing what's happening. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5020.5599999999995s)]
*  And so our goal is, I know like systemic change. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5023.759999999999s)]
*  Like this is a bandaid solution. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5025.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5027.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5027.84s)]
*  Ideally we would not want to exist [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5028.679999999999s)]
*  because like the permanent solution is permanent housing [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5029.92s)]
*  and clean drinking water. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5032.759999999999s)]
*  Like this is not a permanent solution by any means. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5033.96s)]
*  So we would like to render ourselves obsolete [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5036.88s)]
*  because that solution does not exist. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5038.88s)]
*  We're out here doing this. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5041.4800000000005s)]

*  and the mouth of the negotiation [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5470.84s)]

*  It's a slow process. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5477.6s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5481.160000000001s)]
*  Is there a lot of, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5482.0s)]
*  I feel like one common thing that we hear about a lot [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5484.200000000001s)]
*  in shelters specifically is that [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5487.88s)]
*  they can sometimes be unsafe [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5491.92s)]
*  and also they don't let you bring your stuff with you [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5493.320000000001s)]
*  or even if you have pets. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5495.400000000001s)]
*  So is that one of the major reasons [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5498.04s)]
*  of why people sometimes will have shelter process? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5499.6s)]
*  Well, you know, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5503.76s)]
*  often they have people that be petty [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5505.04s)]
*  and powerful musicians and things like that. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5507.4s)]
*  And this is where they think that they have the right [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5510.12s)]
*  to be a lawyer when they're supposed to be professional. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5513.44s)]
*  So therefore, yes, you get those kinds of things [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5516.4s)]
*  that take place. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5518.76s)]
*  Do people lord over you? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5519.6s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't give them that opportunity, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5521.04s)]
*  but I have heard of them doing that to other people, yes. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5523.44s)]
*  We'll talk to Hawk, who has refused to go inside [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=5527.84s)]

*  And they have some orders, but the order is only in the people that are not really in [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6161.8s)]
*  the people that are not properly hired for this situation. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6169.8s)]
*  Some of them are ex-homeless people, drug addicts or whatever. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6173.8s)]
*  That don't make them bad. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6177.8s)]
*  What it does is make it harder for other people who know that. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6179.8s)]
*  And it's harder to get those people to believe that you've changed all of a sudden and miraculously [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6184.8s)]
*  you're okay because we see them fail too. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6189.8s)]
*  And when you go to a mission, they give you a little food, a little lift up, and then [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6193.8s)]
*  they push you out. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6198.8s)]
*  Not all missions are there to house you. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6201.8s)]
*  Some of them are there just to feed you. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6205.8s)]
*  And you got to take it for what it is. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6207.8s)]
*  You go there, you get something to eat, you come back to wherever your humble abode will be. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6209.8s)]
*  But it's still not a perfect system. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6215.8s)]
*  You don't have fresh water, you don't have electricity, can't see. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6220.8s)]
*  And there's a large, large amount of thefts. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6225.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6232.8s)]
*  And there's a large amount of drugs. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6233.8s)]
*  And when you have drugs, there's always more thefts, killing and everything. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6236.8s)]
*  So there's a lot of danger. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6241.8s)]
*  Just say things. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6245.8s)]
*  That's the best way to describe it. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6247.8s)]
*  For people that are not only senior citizens like me, but for families. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6248.8s)]
*  There's young kids out here. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6254.8s)]
*  We are not just prostitutes. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6256.8s)]
*  Young kids. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6260.8s)]
*  And so they're not safe. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6262.8s)]
*  You can't leave your child with anyone. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6263.8s)]
*  But for the most part, the missions are only a temporary service. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6265.8s)]
*  So without the services of... [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6270.8s)]
*  Wait, pop. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6273.8s)]
*  Quietly louder. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6274.8s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6275.8s)]
*  Louder, louder. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6276.8s)]
*  I can't really talk that loud. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6277.8s)]
*  I also just turned it up. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6278.8s)]
*  No, you're good. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6279.8s)]
*  I'm always yelling at you about... [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6280.8s)]
*  I cranked the audio. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6281.8s)]
*  We're good. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6282.8s)]
*  We're good. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6283.8s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6284.8s)]
*  So tell me about speaking louder. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6285.8s)]
*  You're totally fine. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6286.8s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6287.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6288.8s)]
*  For the most part, missions are a great hill. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6289.8s)]
*  But they're not always fast. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6292.8s)]
*  So we're asked by other people, your hosts. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6295.8s)]
*  And they come out, they talk to us, interview us. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6302.8s)]
*  And they see what we need, our needs. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6306.8s)]
*  And then by donations, we get these things. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6309.8s)]
*  And it helps a lot. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6314.8s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6315.8s)]
*  Without it, some of us wouldn't make it. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6316.8s)]
*  And we're thankful. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6319.8s)]
*  We're truly thankful. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6321.8s)]
*  You feel me? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6323.8s)]
*  You want jackets? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6324.8s)]

*  Take your shoes off and walk around. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6667.9s)]
*  See how it feels. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6669.9s)]
*  I'm at a forfeit. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6674.9s)]
*  Alright, back to the subject again. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6675.9s)]
*  How are you? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6676.9s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6677.9s)]
*  So we wanted to ask you about... [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6678.9s)]
*  Are you going to be on camera? [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6680.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6682.9s)]
*  Do you want to be on camera? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6683.9s)]
*  Cool if not. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6684.9s)]
*  I have no problem. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6685.9s)]
*  Oh, okay, perfect. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6686.9s)]
*  You want to step closer then? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6687.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we'll step closer. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6688.9s)]
*  Well, first of all, if you want, we have a bunch of clothes and we have a bunch of tarps [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6689.9s)]
*  and stuff here as well. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6693.9s)]
*  But we wanted to ask you about your experience of being in and out of the shelter structure. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6695.9s)]
*  And if there are any... [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6703.9s)]
*  Because there's some common issues that we hear about with regular frequency, but it's [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6705.9s)]
*  important to get a personal experience. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6710.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6712.9s)]
*  So what would be one common issue that you would consider? [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6713.9s)]
*  I think, well, some of the most common are obviously violence, theft, mismanagement in [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6717.9s)]
*  general. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6723.9s)]
*  And then I think the fact that you can't bring your stuff with you in certain shelters and [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6724.9s)]
*  pets. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6731.9s)]
*  I feel like those are... [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6732.9s)]
*  That's what I hear the most. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6734.9s)]
*  But there is one that you haven't said, which there could be many more. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6735.9s)]
*  Drugs. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6739.9s)]
*  Oh, that too, yeah. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6740.9s)]
*  Mental health. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6741.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6742.9s)]
*  Those are two... [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6743.9s)]
*  That's the real... [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6744.9s)]
*  So what do you say to this? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6745.9s)]
*  ...can be dealt with. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6746.9s)]
*  With drugs, that's a different problem. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6747.9s)]
*  Mental health, that's a different kind of issue. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6748.9s)]
*  Do they have rehabilitation programs at all? [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6753.9s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6755.9s)]
*  That's what I work for. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6756.9s)]
*  At Wine Guard. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6757.9s)]
*  Oh. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6758.9s)]
*  They have a mental health mission, they have a human rescue mission, they have midnight [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6759.9s)]
*  mission, they have people concerned. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6762.9s)]
*  All these persons are looking to try to kill each other. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6765.9s)]
*  Do you feel like... [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6770.9s)]
*  Not to mention prison. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6771.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6772.9s)]
*  My bad. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6773.9s)]
*  I feel like that's true. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6774.9s)]
*  I'm going to keep it, honey. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6775.9s)]
*  I'm going to keep it where it's prevalent. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6776.9s)]
*  I work for a diversion program where they're coming out of jail. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6777.9s)]
*  I'm going to keep it after the program. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6778.9s)]
*  I ain't going to skirt the issue. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6779.9s)]
*  No, no, don't. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6780.9s)]
*  That's what most people are doing. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6781.9s)]
*  They have been in prison for a long time. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6782.9s)]
*  They keep telling themselves fairy tales and think it's just going to take a pill or smoke [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6784.9s)]
*  a joint or hit a pack and it's just going to magically work out. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6789.9s)]
*  They sold us out as kids in cartoons. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6792.9s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6795.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6796.9s)]

*  I'm a good guy. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6809.9s)]
*  I'm a good guy. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6810.9s)]
*  I'm a good guy. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6811.9s)]
*  You're right. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6812.9s)]
*  You're right. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6813.9s)]
*  So... [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6814.9s)]
*  They do have a little bit of rehabilitation. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6815.9s)]
*  Let's get back to it. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6816.9s)]
*  They do have a little bit of rehabilitation. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6817.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6818.9s)]
*  So, I guess... [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6819.9s)]
*  I guess one of the things that I feel like is a... [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6822.9s)]
*  You know, it seems like it's a major hurdle is that like when you don't have... [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6825.9s)]
*  When you only have temporary shelter, when you don't have like a permanent place that [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6830.9s)]
*  you can live inside of, I feel like that makes the rehabilitation process a little bit more [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6833.9s)]
*  difficult as well, especially when you know that you're going to go back out once the [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6837.9s)]
*  program is over. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6841.9s)]
*  But you know in the end, you're going to be kicked right back out. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6842.9s)]
*  That would be right. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6845.9s)]
*  So, do you feel like it would be like an initiative where... [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6846.9s)]
*  Like an initiative where first and foremost, you get placed into not temporary but permanent [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6853.9s)]
*  shelter, like a housing unit of your own where you have some privacy, running water and electricity. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6859.9s)]
*  In that process, do you feel like that would be more beneficial for recovery and rehabilitation [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6863.9s)]
*  for especially like people that have been out on the streets for quite a long time? [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6868.9s)]
*  Yes, but in reality, no two people are the same. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6875.9s)]
*  So, he may come in... [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6882.9s)]
*  Oscar also may come in. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6885.9s)]
*  Did I get that right? [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6888.9s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6889.9s)]
*  And do well and prove that this is an idea. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6890.9s)]
*  Whereas I may come in and every other week there's some kind of getting against the age [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6895.9s)]
*  of anxiety. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6901.9s)]
*  We don't, you know, we don't... [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6902.9s)]
*  So, what I'm saying is yes is the answer, but in the end, do we become the persons to [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6904.9s)]
*  house wrong adult people for the rest of their lives? [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6910.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6913.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6914.9s)]
*  If that's what we have to, yes. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6915.9s)]
*  You just used a word, if. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6918.9s)]
*  If we have to. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6921.9s)]
*  There are places that do that. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6922.9s)]
*  If we have to. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6923.9s)]
*  So, permanent supportive housing is what works, right? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6924.9s)]
*  Like look at Mike going inside, look at Robert. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6925.9s)]
*  You want to talk about revisions? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6926.9s)]
*  Look at TV. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6927.9s)]
*  Oh, I'm just, I'm telling you already, the answer is yes. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6928.9s)]
*  But from person to person, that's going to be, you have to do some work. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6931.9s)]
*  That's all, that's all. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6934.9s)]
*  Because most people like being outside. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6935.9s)]
*  Keep it real. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6936.9s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6937.9s)]
*  They have given... [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6938.9s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6939.9s)]
*  They have given several of the people now that I see, they got them into place. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6940.9s)]
*  But somehow they're right back out here again every day all day long. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6941.9s)]
*  And they lose their place. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6942.9s)]
*  But what about with you? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6943.9s)]
*  You went to the hospital, you went to the hospital, you went to the hospital, you went [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6944.9s)]
*  to the hospital. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6946.9s)]

*  She's talking about, when she says going back inside, you're talking about temporary shelter, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6978.9s)]
*  right? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6984.259999999999s)]
*  You're not talking about a permanent private place that you can live in. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6985.5s)]

*  It has a time frame. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6992.799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=6993.799999999999s)]

*  Right. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7004.799999999999s)]
*  the safety for a long term and it's a very different situation than when you're going in and potentially just [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7005.8s)]
*  going to be kicked right back out or you're subject to all of their rules. Well again I answer this [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7011.16s)]
*  question yes is right but from person to person it becomes how you handle the situation with people [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7015.72s)]
*  because most of them eventually get concerned. Okay if you're a duck, the duck is a duck and the duck is a duck. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7021.96s)]
*  They're going to go back to the two person they are, the daughter, the brother, the daughter, the brother. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7027.96s)]
*  Yes, but you wouldn't say that the broad majority of people are like I would rather live on the trees if I had no restrictions. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7031.96s)]
*  Well my daughter asked me that, my daughter asked me that, she said you'd rather live with roaches and rats than ants. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7042.92s)]
*  You'd be inside? I said no. Ants said no. I'd rather be inside to be honest. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7047.4s)]
*  Would you rather live in a bad shelter or jail? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7051.96s)]
*  Say it again? [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7053.96s)]
*  Would you rather be in a bad shelter or jail? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7055.16s)]
*  A bad shelter. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7057.16s)]
*  Really? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7059.16s)]
*  Less choices, you have to be resonant with everything they say and if you don't what happens? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7062.12s)]
*  They set you more lock up, more lock up, more lock up, more lock up, you know, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7067.32s)]
*  you restrained yourself. I'd rather be in a bad shelter. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7070.76s)]
*  You know, I have to be honest on that one. But yeah, but Hasan's actually, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7075.96s)]
*  yes is the answer and yes we if necessary we house people based on circumstances and situations. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7079.8s)]
*  We can just move everybody in because there's people that can work, there's people that are [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7085.32s)]
*  capable of an able body like myself. I'm living in the Mayfair, only you know, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7089.48s)]
*  obviously my turn, but I'm going back to work. Now I have a place where I can secure my thing. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7094.919999999999s)]
*  Rather than out on the street, somebody, I go get this, get that, now somebody, [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7100.599999999999s)]
*  my tent is nothing but a polyester and rayon. My stuff's gone, I'm sweet, I've already had that [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7104.36s)]
*  happen several times. So I'm tired of that. So I just decided to wait until I get a secure place. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7110.44s)]
*  Now I go back to work, I can buy the finer things. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7115.0s)]
*  That's right. You know, Jeffrey Green shirts and all that kind of stuff. I like those kind of things. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7120.6s)]
*  So what's your story if you don't mind me asking? [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7131.72s)]
*  A few subtle kids, Raising Compa, Watts Long Beach, my mother, four brothers living in the house, [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7134.92s)]
*  lost to jail until I turned 30. Around about 30, I don't know what happened. I went to jail and [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=7141.96s)]

*  I was saying that I don't want to be filmed. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8532.2s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8534.2s)]
*  Because... [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8535.2s)]
*  I'm worried about the fact that you're not filming. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8536.2s)]
*  Oh, crap. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8539.2s)]
*  No, no, I'm in the middle of a... [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8540.2s)]
*  You want to narrate the situation? [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8542.2s)]
*  Sure. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8544.2s)]
*  I take a step back? [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8545.2s)]
*  Okay. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8547.2s)]
*  You're good. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8548.2s)]
*  You can cast. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8550.2s)]
*  Play by play, cast. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8551.2s)]
*  What's happening? [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8552.2s)]
*  Oh, come on, man. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8553.2s)]
*  So I can take my mask off for a second. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8554.2s)]
*  Because I fucking hate wearing my mask. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8556.2s)]
*  So we're here on Skid Row. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8559.2s)]
*  Word has gotten around. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8561.2s)]
*  So now there's a group of about 12 people standing around Tucson [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8563.2s)]
*  who are waiting to get jackets. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8568.2s)]
*  We have a lot of clothes. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8569.2s)]
*  So we're going to give them pants and clothes and everything like that. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8570.2s)]
*  And I think what Chad will have noticed at this point [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8574.2s)]
*  is in this place where people are street living, hard living, [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8577.2s)]
*  that even though there are obviously problems here, [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8582.2s)]
*  people wake up every day and they're on the street [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8584.2s)]
*  and some of them deal with addiction and other problems, [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8586.2s)]
*  the reality is that this isn't a horror show. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8590.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8592.2s)]
*  These people are living their lives. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8593.2s)]
*  They're doing the best they can in a bad situation. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8594.2s)]
*  This is just the three of us here. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8597.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8599.2s)]
*  Like, don't believe everything you see in the news and on TV. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8600.2s)]
*  These are people. These are human beings. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8604.2s)]
*  The truth is you're closer to this situation. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8606.2s)]
*  You're closer to being in this situation [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8609.2s)]
*  than you're ever closer to being Elon Musk [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8611.2s)]
*  or even a multimillionaire or whatever. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8615.2s)]
*  These are... [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8619.2s)]
*  These are regular-ass people who hit hard times in one way or another. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8621.2s)]
*  I don't know what that other guy's story, who we were just talking to, [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8627.2s)]
*  he said he didn't want to be on camera, but I overheard he said to his son [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8629.2s)]
*  that he was a former union guy. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8632.2s)]
*  He's street living. He's here. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8635.2s)]
*  We don't know what his situation is, but that's every single story. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8636.2s)]
*  And the people that I work with now in the Bronx [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8639.2s)]
*  and the people that I've worked with in the past in the Bronx, same thing. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8642.2s)]
*  You don't know what tomorrow is going to bring. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8646.2s)]
*  Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8649.2s)]
*  This is why you need stable housing. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8653.2s)]
*  This is why you need access to those kind of things. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8655.2s)]
*  So there you go. That's it. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8658.2s)]
*  But it's cool, man. It's good. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8660.2s)]
*  This is good stuff. I'm glad that we're doing this. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8662.2s)]
*  All right. I'm going to walk back over. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8664.2s)]
*  Okay. Sorry. Sorry. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8666.2s)]
*  No, that was great. I just can't point the camera up over here. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8667.2s)]
*  I have so much. You can take whatever you want. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8670.2s)]
*  I don't have more of those, but I have other jackets. They're very cool. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8673.2s)]
*  I promise you. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8678.2s)]
*  I have rain jackets. I have hoodies. I have regular jackets. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8680.2s)]
*  Is there anything you need? Like pants? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8684.2s)]

*  What do you need? You need pants? [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8687.2s)]
*  I do. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8688.2s)]
*  Okay. Pants are a little freaky, though. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8689.2s)]
*  They're my pants. I'm sorry. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8691.2s)]
*  So I got these. You like them? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8693.2s)]
*  I got these. What do you think about these? [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8696.2s)]

*  So it's pretty big. I'm sorry. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8710.2s)]

*  Hoodie. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=8718.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9507.2s)]
*  That was pretty devastating for a lot of people. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9509.2s)]
*  It's nice that they finally [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9511.2s)]
*  erected the statue. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9513.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9515.2s)]

*  Hell yeah. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9521.2s)]
*  We're really really proud of it. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9523.2s)]
*  Vanessa's been working really really hard on behalf of the family. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9525.2s)]
*  So she's representing really good. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9527.2s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9529.2s)]
*  So Glenn how long [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9531.2s)]
*  have you been out here? [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9533.2s)]
*  I was displaced [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9535.2s)]
*  October 30th of last year. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9537.2s)]
*  Actually. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9539.2s)]
*  And it's an illegal eviction. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9541.2s)]
*  And then they were supposed to give me [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9543.2s)]
*  15 days to get my belongings out. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9545.2s)]
*  And they didn't even wait 10 years. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9547.2s)]
*  So that's another part of the [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9549.2s)]
*  civil suit against SRO housing. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9551.2s)]
*  But that's neither here nor there. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9553.2s)]
*  We can't wait to get to court. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9555.2s)]
*  But I've been out here [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9557.2s)]
*  you know, tens of tens. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9559.2s)]
*  SROs have been saying [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9561.2s)]
*  tug of war on me. Come stay with me. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9563.2s)]
*  But I don't like to impose [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9565.2s)]
*  on people. And everybody [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9567.2s)]
*  knows me as a giver and not a taker. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9569.2s)]
*  My cash [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9573.2s)]
*  app tag [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9575.2s)]
*  is BillPayer. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9577.2s)]
*  When people give me things I like [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9579.2s)]
*  to return them to them. Reciprocate [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9581.2s)]
*  BillPayer. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9583.2s)]
*  BillPayer. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9585.2s)]
*  Okay. I like that. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9587.2s)]
*  Alright. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9589.2s)]
*  Two N's. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9591.2s)]
*  World famous skid row. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9593.2s)]
*  I'm originally from Cincinnati, [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9595.2s)]
*  Ohio. Downtown [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9597.2s)]
*  West End. Rora Holmes project. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9599.2s)]
*  So how'd you find yourself [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9601.2s)]
*  out here? So you say you got evicted [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9603.2s)]
*  illegally? Yeah, illegal eviction. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9605.2s)]
*  Because I was not served any [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9607.2s)]
*  kind of notice, warning [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9609.2s)]
*  papers. Anything like that. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9611.2s)]
*  I was behind [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9613.2s)]
*  in rent. But that got paid. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9615.2s)]
*  So that wasn't what I was being [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9617.2s)]
*  evicted for. I was being evicted [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9619.2s)]
*  for some write ups that I'd never [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9621.2s)]
*  seen, never received, never been [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9623.2s)]
*  presented with, never reached [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9625.2s)]
*  my door or no manager [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9627.2s)]
*  informed me about any [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9629.2s)]
*  write ups whatsoever. So that's going to be interesting [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9631.2s)]
*  to talk about in court. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9633.2s)]
*  And the manager who [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9635.2s)]
*  had evicted me is [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9637.2s)]
*  no longer the manager of that property. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9639.2s)]
*  Which is the Palmer House on [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9641.2s)]
*  Wall Street next to DWP across [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9643.2s)]
*  the street from the police station. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9645.2s)]
*  I've been there for nine years [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9647.2s)]

*  2014. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9653.2s)]
*  And I had no [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9655.2s)]
*  difficulties, no problems with [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9657.2s)]
*  any previous managers until [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9659.2s)]
*  this last manager [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9661.2s)]
*  that they brought in. She didn't [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9663.2s)]
*  stay but maybe a little over a year. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9665.2s)]
*  Just evicting people left and right. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9667.2s)]
*  I'm sure they were [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9669.2s)]
*  illegally evicted as well. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9671.2s)]
*  And I did a little [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9673.2s)]
*  studying of law so I [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9675.2s)]

*  many people are down here addicted [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9749.2s)]

*  It's popularity has grown [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9753.2s)]
*  quicker than any other drug in [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9755.2s)]

*  That's not a good thing. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9759.2s)]
*  So [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9761.2s)]
*  I've been fentanyl poisons [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9763.2s)]

*  up in the hospital bed with a Narcan [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9773.2s)]
*  drip which I never even thought or knew [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9775.2s)]
*  existed. And I spent [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9777.2s)]
*  three nights in the hospital. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9779.2s)]
*  That was my worst [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9781.2s)]
*  episode of being poisoned because I [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9783.2s)]

*  brought me back. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9789.2s)]
*  And I'm sure [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9791.2s)]
*  there's a purpose behind that. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9793.2s)]
*  So you beat that landlord in court? [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9797.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. It's a slam dunk. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9799.2s)]

*  get sick if they don't have it. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9887.2s)]

*  Mostly not making it at all. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9911.2s)]

*  I was helpless [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9927.2s)]
*  and useless to save them because [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9929.2s)]
*  I had no norcan [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=9931.2s)]

*  And it's just [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10005.2s)]
*  one tragic [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10007.2s)]
*  you know, situation, circumstance [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10009.2s)]
*  that I wish I had never [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10011.2s)]
*  ever experienced or [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10013.2s)]
*  witnessed. Yeah. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10015.2s)]
*  So many of those situations [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10017.2s)]
*  are occurring even this [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10019.2s)]
*  minute that people are being poisoned [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10021.2s)]
*  with fentanyl. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10023.2s)]
*  I don't know if it's a matter of education [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10027.2s)]
*  or [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10029.2s)]
*  people just out here evil [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10031.2s)]
*  and just passing it to people [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10033.2s)]
*  as something [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10035.2s)]
*  elated. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10037.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're not telling people what they're [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10039.2s)]
*  giving them. And fentanyl has been [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10041.2s)]
*  incorporated in so many [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10043.2s)]
*  different drugs. I watched Netflix [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10045.2s)]
*  and it told me that fentanyl [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10047.2s)]
*  has been mixed in with [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10049.2s)]
*  heroin for years. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10051.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10053.2s)]
*  Maybe we got to get test kits out here. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10055.2s)]
*  There are plenty of test kits [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10057.2s)]
*  they give them out freely and often. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10059.2s)]
*  Do people not test them? [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10061.2s)]
*  I guess they're not using [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10063.2s)]
*  them or using them improperly. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10065.2s)]
*  Whatever the case is [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10067.2s)]
*  there's just too much [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10069.2s)]
*  use of it. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10071.2s)]
*  It's too abundant to get a hold [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10073.2s)]
*  of. It's [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10075.2s)]
*  inexpensive and [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10079.2s)]
*  it's dangerous and deadly. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10081.2s)]
*  I want to say that. And I wish [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10083.2s)]
*  that we didn't have this epidemic [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10085.2s)]

*  it's only hurting the [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10191.2s)]
*  community. It's not productive. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10193.2s)]
*  It's not [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10195.2s)]
*  positive or constructive. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10197.2s)]

*  everybody down [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10201.2s)]

*  the value of this [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10205.2s)]

*  encouraged me to come here [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10225.2s)]
*  and I [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10227.2s)]

*  Southwest and [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10231.2s)]

*  stay here, stay there [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10235.2s)]

*  people don't tell their landlords what [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10239.2s)]

*  I mean, that was great. Did a little bit of good [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10637.2s)]
*  to offset all the fucking evil [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10639.2s)]
*  that you've been doing all year. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10641.2s)]
*  Yeah, all the evils [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10643.2s)]
*  that I do by owning a house. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10645.2s)]
*  And a car. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10647.2s)]

*  I know. Yeah. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10651.2s)]
*  I didn't cover the Blake Lively [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10653.2s)]
*  story with the [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10655.2s)]
*  tone that it deserved. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10657.2s)]
*  Even though I agree [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10659.2s)]
*  with the points that he made. I didn't like [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10661.2s)]
*  the tone he took. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10663.2s)]
*  Alright, well... [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10665.2s)]

*  Evil Hasan art. Oh, no. This is [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10671.2s)]
*  how it is. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10673.2s)]

*  You need to hold more space for Lolo crying? [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10705.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10707.2s)]
*  I need to hold space for [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10709.2s)]
*  queer media. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10711.2s)]
*  Lolo's queer media. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10713.2s)]
*  It's just like, my... [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10715.2s)]
*  I'm gonna do this [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10717.2s)]
*  every time we stream. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10719.2s)]
*  You are... [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10721.2s)]
*  Well, no, because... [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10723.2s)]
*  Somebody that... [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10727.2s)]
*  I care about, like, [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10731.2s)]
*  died of a fentanyl overdose [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10733.2s)]
*  in 2021. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10735.2s)]
*  And so, like, [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10737.2s)]
*  you know, hearing him talk about that [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10739.2s)]
*  was, you know, [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10741.2s)]
*  emotional. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10745.2s)]
*  I guess. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10747.2s)]
*  It's understandable, man. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10749.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's very sad. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10751.2s)]
*  It's horrible. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10753.2s)]
*  That's why they need, you know, wide availability [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10755.2s)]
*  of testing and all that shit. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10757.2s)]
*  But, uh, as I was saying to [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10759.2s)]
*  Marsh before, when you were handing out all of your [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10761.2s)]
*  ridiculous clothing, [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10763.2s)]
*  you're wasting [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10765.2s)]
*  your ridiculous clothes on people. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10767.2s)]
*  People liked it, and also, I... [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10769.2s)]
*  Well, what I said was... [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10771.2s)]
*  I gave my merch, I gave Carl Jenkins' merch, [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10773.2s)]
*  I gave my Thieves' merch... [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10775.2s)]
*  But what I was saying was, like, everybody here [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10777.2s)]
*  is, like, you know, it's not the fucking... [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10779.2s)]
*  It's not, like, [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10781.2s)]
*  Zombieland, like, when you watch, you know, [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10783.2s)]
*  Fox News or something. Yeah. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10785.2s)]
*  Which are real people who are just here [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10787.2s)]
*  doing their best, trying, [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10789.2s)]
*  you know, surviving. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10791.2s)]
*  That's really what I wanted to showcase today [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10793.2s)]
*  for a lot of people, is that, like, [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10795.2s)]
*  when you see someone from afar, [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10797.2s)]
*  uh, and [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10799.2s)]
*  you're worried about, [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10801.2s)]
*  like, uh, you know, the way that they might be [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10803.2s)]
*  walking, or the way that they're carrying themselves, [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10805.2s)]
*  and, uh, [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10807.2s)]
*  and you've seen so many, [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10809.2s)]
*  like, ruthless, cruel depictions [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10811.2s)]
*  of unhoused people in media [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10813.2s)]
*  all the way from the fucking Tyler [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10815.2s)]
*  Oliveras of the world, even the people who are, [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10817.2s)]
*  like, even the people [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10819.2s)]
*  who are supposedly, quote-unquote, doing nice things [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10821.2s)]
*  by, like, giving money, like, [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10823.2s)]
*  people who very obviously [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10825.2s)]
*  are there to extract [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10827.2s)]
*  something out of that interaction. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10829.2s)]
*  I think all of that plays a role [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10831.2s)]
*  in presenting [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10833.2s)]
*  homes people not as, like, human beings, [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10835.2s)]
*  but of this, like, blob, this parasitic hive [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10837.2s)]
*  mind. And that was the [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10839.2s)]
*  reason why I really wanted to come here with, [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10841.2s)]
*  uh, you know, people that work here, [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10843.2s)]
*  people that have, uh, relationships [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10845.2s)]
*  that they've developed with the people that live [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10847.2s)]
*  here, because these guys are just, like, [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10849.2s)]
*  they're, they're very [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10851.2s)]
*  close to people in this chat. Like, [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10853.2s)]
*  I don't think you understand, I don't think anybody understands [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10855.2s)]
*  that, like, there was [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10857.2s)]
*  a guy that we were talking to who was a fucking [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10859.2s)]
*  Union carpenter, right? [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10861.2s)]
*  Like, and I, I didn't ask him, [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10863.2s)]
*  but I suspect that part of the process [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10865.2s)]
*  he said he injured himself, he [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10867.2s)]
*  injured his back in his job, [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10869.2s)]
*  and I'm sure that, uh, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10871.2s)]
*  the recovery process of that [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10873.2s)]
*  probably played an active role [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10875.2s)]
*  in, uh, the, in the many [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10877.2s)]
*  years that he spent trying to figure [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10879.2s)]
*  things out landed him here. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10881.2s)]
*  And the [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10883.2s)]
*  reason why I mention that is because [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10885.2s)]
*  like, [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10887.2s)]
*  these are real human beings, [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10891.2s)]
*  they have real human experiences, [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10893.2s)]
*  it's not just, like, [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10895.2s)]
*  some fucking content, you know what I mean? [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10897.2s)]
*  And I needed people to, [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10899.2s)]
*  I wanted people to understand that, and I'm so [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10901.2s)]
*  glad that Sade helped us out [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10903.2s)]
*  with that, on that front too, cause like, I think [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10905.2s)]
*  if we just came here on our own it wouldn't, you know. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10907.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was great. Cause, remember, like, [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10909.2s)]
*  the first, the first dude we talked to, like, was [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10911.2s)]
*  uh, a little suspicious, like, [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10913.2s)]
*  because I think people, understandably, like, [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10915.2s)]
*  when you come in with a camera, I think that this is something [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10917.2s)]
*  that they've seen before, many times over, they probably [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10919.2s)]
*  were like, oh, these fucking assholes are coming in. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10921.2s)]
*  Yeah. You know, [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10923.2s)]
*  throw money on the ground, [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10925.2s)]
*  and watch me fucking, [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10927.2s)]
*  watch me try to pick it up, [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10929.2s)]
*  but, you know, [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10931.2s)]
*  these are real human beings, and you are very close [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10933.2s)]
*  to them, in your class position, [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10935.2s)]
*  um, you know, [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10937.2s)]
*  one, one medical incident [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10939.2s)]
*  could, uh, could put you in a similar [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv72kBlPp9A&t=10941.2s)]
