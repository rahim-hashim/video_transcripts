# Israel Implements Stronger Actions In Lebanon | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18)
*  Okay, October 7 numbers. We've passed it. We passed it. We passed October 7 numbers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=0.0s)]
*  Hezbollah by Israel's own design has the right to defend itself. Okay. Significantly larger [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=6.26s)]
*  civilian by the way in comparison to October 7. Now let's get to let's get back to Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=13.02s)]
*  We're going to talk about the media bias as well. But before that, let's watch statement [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=25.8s)]
*  by prime minister, Benjamin Ninny Yahoo, seemingly very upset after French president [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=30.8s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron has urged a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, which has been criticized over [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=36.84s)]
*  the, over the conduct of its war on Gaza. Where is this coming from? Well, because obviously [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=42.24s)]
*  the French have designs for Lebanon and those designs get up. If Israel also has designs [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=47.84s)]
*  for Lebanon. I have a message. I have a message for president Macron. Today, Israel is defending [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=55.88s)]
*  itself on seven fronts against the enemy. So the ISIS format of the Mujahideen, is that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=62.24s)]
*  what it's on? It's like I'm not no, yes and no. Civilization. We're fighting in Gaza against [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=67.16s)]
*  Hamas. Those savages who murdered, raped, beheaded and burned our people on October [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=73.32s)]
*  7. We're fighting in Lebanon against his Bala, the most heavily armed terror organization [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=78.68s)]
*  in the world, which was planning and even why does he have a message for the French [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=83.78s)]
*  and English? Like, why is there no one translating this message to French for the Israeli prime [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  minister's office? Do they not have any French translators in Israel? There's plenty of, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  there are plenty of French Israelis that speak French. You know, what's going on there? What's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=98.58s)]
*  happening? I hate to be that guy, but I think you forgot to run the ads. Never hate to be [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=103.66s)]
*  that guy. You are correct. I did forget to run the ads. I'm running it now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  An even greater massacre than October 7th on our Northern border. And that is rocketed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=112.02s)]
*  Israeli towns and cities for nearly a year. Wait, Hezbollah has done an even greater massacre [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=116.38s)]
*  than Hamas did. That's crazy. How many, how many people did they kill? That's wild. I [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=122.66s)]
*  didn't realize they killed 1200 people, including like 400 military members, members of the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=128.74s)]
*  military. We're fighting against. Oh, apparently they're planning. Oh, they were planning it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=135.9s)]
*  Yeah. Well, so was Hamas and you didn't really give a shit about that planning. Did you? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  Houthis in Yemen and the Shia militias in Iraq and Syria that together have launched [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=145.94s)]
*  hundreds of drones and missile attacks against Israel. We're fighting against terrorists [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  in Judea and Samaria. We're trying to murder civilians in the heart of our cities. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  That's the West Bank. He's saying we're fighting in the West Bank territory that we illegally [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=159.38s)]
*  occupy against people who are like, Hey man, this is my home. Maybe you shouldn't do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=163.54s)]
*  We were fighting against Iran, which last week fired over 200 ballistic missiles directly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=169.1s)]
*  at Israel and which stands behind the seven front war against Israel. As Israel fights [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=174.46s)]
*  the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=179.45999999999998s)]
*  side. Yet president Macron and some other Western leaders are now calling for an arms [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=185.26s)]
*  embargo against Israel. Shame on them. Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=191.98s)]
*  on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. The axis of terror [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=197.5s)]
*  stands together, but countries who supposedly are- [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=203.94s)]
*  It's so funny. It's so funny when they say the axis of terror stands together. It's like, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=207.54s)]
*  bro, for everyone with eyes to see you and America and all of the regional partners are [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=213.54s)]
*  of terror. Okay. The numbers, numbers on the board, these guys don't touch the madness [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=221.68s)]
*  that you conduct in the region. Like the, the, and the destruction that you engage with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=229.0s)]
*  in the region. It is so funny to be like, these guys, they are terrorists. They're terror. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=234.4s)]
*  They're doing terror. It's like, okay, what are you doing then? Like, is there a different [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=239.68s)]
*  term for what you're doing? Because what you're doing is, is worse, like significantly worse [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=244.58s)]
*  in terms of the numbers. I don't give a f- If there's like, in his mind, if there is justification [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=249.4s)]
*  for it, that doesn't mean anything. Do you understand? Like people are so ridiculous [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=254.6s)]
*  about this. They're like, oh, Hassan, you don't understand. Israel good. Israel's enemy's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=259.4s)]
*  bad. Duh. Oh, okay. Didn't- Oh, dude, didn't realize that that was your, your, the way [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=264.0s)]
*  that you were operating, you know? It's like the Nazis on the Japanese. No, man. It's not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=270.48s)]
*  like the Nazi on the Japanese. It's like the Nazi on the, the Allied forces. Okay? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=276.04s)]
*  Because he's the Nazi here. Straight up. Straight up. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=283.36s)]
*  Close the stair access. Call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace. Well, let me tell [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=287.08000000000004s)]
*  you this. Israel will win with or without their support, but their shame will continue [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=293.68s)]
*  long after the war is won. For in defending ourselves against this barbarism, Israel is [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=299.54s)]
*  defending civilizations against those who seek to impose a dark age of fanaticism on- [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=304.74s)]
*  Like, he just keeps saying that we're fighting against barbarism. We're fighting against [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=310.02s)]
*  these barbarians. Like, oh my God. It's just like, it's truly demonic Nazi. I don't know. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=314.18s)]
*  I don't know how people still don't see it. Like- [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=320.58s)]
*  On all of us, rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won, for our sake and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=323.14s)]
*  for the sake of the peace and security of the entire world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=330.18s)]
*  Hezbollah has expanded its bombardment of Lebanon, striking new areas- [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=334.62s)]
*  Oh yeah. Now they went even northern than Beirut. They're now, they're like, yeah, we, we're [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=338.1s)]
*  bombing the capital, but we're also going to bomb even northern, further up north as [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=343.96s)]
*  well. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  The target's members are both Hezbollah and Hamas. While Hezbollah has kept up its attacks [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  on northern Israel, saying it's fired rockets at an air base near the city of Haifa. In [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  southern Lebanon, the Israel defense forces say they hit a Hezbollah command center overnight, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=358.18s)]
*  located in a mosque adjacent to the Salah Gondor hospital. For the first time in this [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=363.86s)]
*  conflict, Israel has hit Tripoli in northern- [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=369.3s)]
*  Like, dude, what are we doing? What are we doing, bro? What are we doing? Yeah. Striking [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=371.58000000000004s)]

*  in Gaza, by the way, which by the way is such a normal part of the process at this point [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=382.74s)]
*  that like, it's not even newsworthy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=387.22s)]
*  ...in northern Lebanon, reportedly killing an official from Hamas's military wing, his [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=388.9s)]
*  wife and two young daughters in a drone strike. And Israel has continued to strike the Lebanese [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=393.78s)]
*  capital here, Beirut. Its military issued warnings for residents in three southern suburbs [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=399.14s)]
*  near the airport to evacuate buildings around Hezbollah facilities. Alex Thompson reports [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=404.5s)]
*  on the day's events. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=409.94s)]
*  The Gaza- [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  They're still doing this, by the way. They're still doing propaganda. They're like, oh, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  it's the Hezbollah facilities. Hezbollah facilities. Oh, dude. Oh, well, sorry. The [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=415.22s)]
*  hospital was in the way, you know. Great stuff. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=421.82000000000005s)]
*  The strategy in Lebanon. From air and sea, Beirut pounded again overnight. By day, civilian [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  jets still fly in and out against the bombing of the city's southern suburbs. Israel talks [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=431.22s)]
*  about pinpoint strikes. The Lebanese Health Ministry says more than 2,000 people have [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=437.04s)]
*  far across the country, including 127. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=443.58s)]
*  Yeah, they're double tapping healthcare workers. Healthcare continues to come under attack. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=446.58s)]
*  In Lebanon alone, 28 health workers have been killed in the last 24 hours, says World Health [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=451.46s)]
*  Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a press briefing in Geneva on Wednesday. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=455.09999999999997s)]
*  More than 1,600 people have been killed and more than 1 million. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=463.02s)]
*  Okay, October 7 numbers. We've passed it. We passed it. We passed October 7 numbers. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=468.58s)]
*  Hezbollah, by Israel's own design, has the right to defend itself. Okay. Significantly [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=475.3s)]
*  larger civilian, by the way, in comparison to October 7. October 7, 400 military, 400 [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=481.26s)]
*  military were killed. 800 civilians were killed, some of which were killed by Israeli, you [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=489.26s)]
*  know, the Israeli security forces anyway. But regardless, let's say all 400, all 800 [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=495.82s)]
*  are killed by Hamas and the Palestinian resistance force. Israel's done genocide in Gaza. Does [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=502.62s)]
*  this mean that Hezbollah and the Lebanese force have a right to defend themselves? Do [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=507.38s)]
*  they have a right to defend themselves? Can they now do genocide in Israel? Of course [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=511.74s)]
*  not. Of course not. I don't think that that is right anyway. I'm not saying that at all, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=515.9s)]
*  but just understand if like, you know, there was a, if the, if the morality was evened [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=520.88s)]
*  out, that is how this situation would be analyzed. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=526.32s)]
*  It's placed including 350,000 now living in shelters and 160,000 who have crossed the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=530.04s)]
*  border into the Syrian Arab Republic. Healthcare continues to come under attack. In Lebanon [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=540.08s)]
*  alone, 28 health workers have been killed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=549.56s)]
*  It's so funny that people still like grab on to the, the only counter to all of this, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=552.16s)]
*  like the glaringly obvious realities. The only counter to any of this is to basically [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=558.4s)]
*  just go la la la, can't hear you, Hassan supports terrorists. That's it. Like you have no answer [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=563.76s)]
*  for this. You have, you have no way of being able to justify this. So you just go, nah, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=569.88s)]
*  they're terrorists. They're barbaric. They're terrorists. Like you just repeat what Benjamin [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=575.16s)]
*  Iniyahu is saying and that's it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=579.48s)]
*  In the last 24 hours, many health workers are not reporting to duty as they fled the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  areas where they work due to bombardments. This is severely limiting the provision of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  mass trauma management and continuity of health services. We had planned to deliver a large [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=596.4s)]
*  shipment of trauma and medical supplies tomorrow to Lebanon. Unfortunately, this has not been [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=603.72s)]
*  possible due to the almost complete closure of Beirut's airport. WHO calls on all partners [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=611.0s)]
*  to facilitate flights to deliver much needed life saving supplies to Lebanon. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=619.04s)]

*  and capabilities is like the same as America. Okay. What I mean is they have oil refineries [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=782.28s)]
*  that are directly within the line of fire of Iranian missile systems. It's that simple. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=791.12s)]

*  literally that simple. They're like, look, look, China brought Iran and Saudi Arabia [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=808.84s)]

*  Why did China do this? Because they need the oil as well. Why does Saudi Arabia come to the table? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=825.4s)]
*  Because they also like their oil refineries. Okay. If Iran strikes or if the Houthis or Iran [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=831.76s)]
*  strikes oil refineries in Saudi Arabia, that's not good for anybody. Okay. And that was, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=842.28s)]
*  that is something that happened before October 7. Mind you. Okay. It's a massive amount of leverage [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  that Iran has as a regional actor. So, so for them, they're like, okay, yeah, we have a security [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=856.7199999999999s)]

*  blowing up our oil refineries. Because if you blow up our oil refineries, then, you know, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=871.24s)]
*  our economy is cooked and the entire global marketplace falls apart. This is a reality that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm sure Americans are also aware of. There's no way that they're that stupid. Okay. Foreign [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=881.6s)]

*  Israel's quote limited incursion looks ever more like unlimited invasion in scope and scale. Wow, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=904.52s)]
*  that's crazy. I can't believe that their limited incursion is actually an unlimited invasion. Hmm, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=911.4799999999999s)]
*  shocking. Not only the Lebanese getting out another, you are severely underestimating the [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  idiocy of the general American populace. No, man, I'm just looking at the American government as a [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=924.1199999999999s)]
*  as a capitalist institution, a capitalist instrument that obviously benefits, especially key [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=929.88s)]
*  sectors benefit from permanent death and destruction in the Middle East, but only to a certain degree. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=937.9599999999999s)]
*  Once oil refineries catch on fire, nobody benefits from that the entire economy, the entire global [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=943.9599999999999s)]
*  economy runs on the petrodollar. It collapses everything. Okay. It's kind of like the Trump [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=949.88s)]
*  equation. Okay, a lot of business owners like Donald Trump, but a lot of business owners are [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  also afraid of Donald Trump. Why are they afraid of Donald Trump? Because Donald Trump spells [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=961.0s)]
*  instability, too much instability, like a certain amount of instability, and deregulation and [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=965.0s)]
*  everything else is great, right? It's great for businesses. But too much of that can also spell [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=970.76s)]
*  trouble because the market needs stability. Okay, the market benefits from a certain level of chaos, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=976.6s)]
*  but there also needs to be some level of stability too much volatility is not good. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=983.16s)]
*  This sums it up pretty well. Is school illegal in the US? The answer is yes. Now, Israel is going to [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=988.36s)]
*  retaliate to Iran. Israel has said they're going to retaliate to Iran in a decapitating strike [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=995.64s)]
*  against the Iranian leadership. Now, if they did that, that would be devastating. That would be [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1001.24s)]
*  devastating for the region. Israel also has said they would retaliate against Iranian nuclear plants [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1007.4s)]
*  that are a part of their energy grid, or Iranian oil refineries. Iran has said, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1013.16s)]
*  if Israel retaliates at all, we will respond in kind. If Israel specifically retaliates against [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1018.52s)]
*  their energy grid, they will respond in kind. If Israel retaliates against their oil refineries, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1025.48s)]
*  they will light the entire region's oil refineries on fire. Okay, it is what I'm talking about [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1033.32s)]
*  when I say mutually assured destruction. That's it. That basically is at that point. It's just [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1041.56s)]
*  like complete collapse of the global market evacuation flight, the last scheduled to leave [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1047.3999999999999s)]
*  Beirut tomorrow, along with a host of other countries doing this in recent days, or remaining [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1052.4399999999998s)]
*  foreigners advise to contact their embassies. Yeah, I suspect that the reason why it's taken [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1058.36s)]
*  so long for the Israeli response is because they are, I think, worried about the actual [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1064.1999999999998s)]
*  repercussions, the actual consequences for the record. What can Iran hit in Israel though? The [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1068.76s)]
*  soda stream factory? No, I mean, I'm there's plenty of things that they can hit inside of Israel. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1074.36s)]
*  It's more so if they choose to now strike more civilian targets, our refineries really any more [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1080.28s)]
*  vulnerable than Tel Aviv dog understand that no government actually cares about like their own [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1085.96s)]
*  civilians. Okay. No state actor is like all that concerned about their civilians. They do care about [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1093.16s)]
*  one thing and one thing only, and that is making sure that oil refineries don't all collectively [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1099.64s)]
*  catch on fire. That would destroy the global economy. Okay. Overnight. How was Iran? Oh, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1107.3200000000002s)]
*  this is a good reporting on how hitting oil refineries will, what is this will affect the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1115.16s)]
*  world economy? Iran attacked Israel on Tuesday night with about 200 missiles. They managed to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1119.48s)]
*  hit a few military bases and the Mossad headquarters. There were no Israeli casualties. One Palestinian [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1124.44s)]
*  died, but that doesn't mean that all is forgiven and forgotten. First pose. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1130.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Is figuring out what to strike, where to strike. There are a number of potential targets, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1139.24s)]
*  nuclear, oil, military facilities in Iran. Let's look at them one by one. First, there's Iran's [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1144.6s)]
*  nuclear program. Now Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon. It was work in progress, but officially [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1150.28s)]
*  Iran stopped developing nukes in the year 2003 or rather they pause their efforts. That's what they [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1157.32s)]
*  say, but they still have nuclear facilities all over the country. As you can see on this map, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1163.32s)]
*  Iran can make weapons grade nuclear material. It can enrich uranium at some of these sites. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  And these facilities are in use despite the nuclear pause. The Iran hasn't gone all the way [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1174.12s)]
*  yet, but it keeps nuclear material production on the precipice so that if anything major happens, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1181.0s)]
*  it can rapidly complete a nuclear weapon or two. All of Iran's enemies know this. Israel knows it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1187.4799999999998s)]
*  The U S knows it and everyone else does. Yeah. I don't know about this, but when is she going to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1193.56s)]
*  talk about the mutual destruction of this Iranian TV? No dog is, is like a right-wing Indian newspaper. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1198.44s)]
*  Yeah. Is India's Fox news, right? She's the Dana Bush of India, Dana Bush. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1209.0s)]
*  Some of Iran's nuclear sites are protected deep underground. It would be almost impossible to blow [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1223.8s)]
*  them up. So if Israel manages to blow up one nuclear facility, Iran can ramp up production [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1229.0s)]
*  at another and develop a working nuclear bomb in a matter of days. Okay. This part is the least [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1234.92s)]
*  significant part in this story. This is the least significant part of the story. Okay. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1241.16s)]
*  Especially because like who cares if they have a new or not. I don't, I don't give it. Okay. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1247.4s)]
*  Because with the current conventional means that they have at their disposal, they can still blow [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1252.2s)]
*  up oil refineries. Are they going to talk about that or not? That is why Joe Biden doesn't want [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1257.48s)]
*  Israel to go after Iran's nuclear sites because that is an all or nothing gamble. If even one [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1262.04s)]
*  site is still functional, then Iran will become the world's next nuclear power. That is why Israel [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1268.92s)]
*  probably won't target Iran's nuclear facilities, at least not seriously, but they could conduct a [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1275.16s)]
*  symbolic strike at one of the smaller facilities just to show Iran that Israel can attack their [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1280.68s)]
*  nuclear sites. And this was suggested. We know Israel can attack their nuclear sites. We Israel [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1286.3600000000001s)]
*  Israel has the capacity to attack anywhere and everywhere around the planet. Okay. It's just [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1293.24s)]
*  like we know that already. I think that's an expectation. That's precisely the reason why [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1298.2s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear facilities are deep underground, specifically without outside of the reach of like [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1302.8400000000001s)]
*  conventional bunker, bust their bombs even. Okay. Like I think people know that people [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1308.44s)]
*  understand that people have geared their defenses against that. Right. The real question is, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  why are you watching garb time? Someone linked it to me by a former Israeli prime minister. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1321.24s)]
*  His name is Ehood Barak. He said this was a possibility and it won't be a first Israel did [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1327.16s)]
*  something similar in April after Iran launched its first missile barrage in April this year, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1332.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel responded by attacking an Iranian facility near the city of Isfahan. The attack was close to [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1337.88s)]
*  an Iranian nuclear site, even though it wasn't directly targeted. The point I'm trying to make, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1344.3600000000001s)]
*  the point I'm trying to make here is that it doesn't matter. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1350.6000000000001s)]
*  Iran could be moments away from developing a nuclear weapon. Iran could have a nuclear weapon. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1353.8000000000002s)]
*  That part, that part is completely inconsequential in the grand scheme of things because the current [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1360.68s)]
*  weapons that they do have that we know they have are capable of striking oil refineries, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1366.84s)]
*  which would be, I would just go so far as they almost as devastating as nuke. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1373.32s)]
*  Israel basically let them off with a warning, a symbolic show. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1378.76s)]
*  So a direct but limited attack at a nuclear plant could be an option, at least according to Israel's [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1383.24s)]
*  former prime minister, even though it is risky. But Netanyahu has other options too, including [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1389.72s)]
*  going back to the basics. Israel could just target military facilities, airfields, drone bases, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1395.32s)]
*  missile silos. It could even go after production facilities, target Iran's drone and missile [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1400.9199999999998s)]
*  factories. It isn't flashy, it isn't extremely sophisticated, but it will send the message. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1406.6s)]
*  And technically, this is the only thing allowed according to the standard rules of war. But Israel [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1411.8799999999999s)]
*  hasn't really been playing. Netanyahu doesn't care about what he hits as long as it does serious [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1417.1599999999999s)]
*  damage. And what will really hurt Iran is going after its pocket. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1424.28s)]
*  That looks like another Biden blooper. He revealed that Israel is thinking about attacking Iran's oil [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1437.32s)]
*  facilities. Biden said discussions are ongoing. Is the U.S. discussing this internally? Are they [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1442.44s)]
*  holding discussions with Israel? Biden did not confirm. But it seems that attacks on Iranian oil [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1448.04s)]
*  are a possibility. So let's turn to the map again. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1454.44s)]
*  I want to point to something here. Okay. The motive supporting right-wing Indian news anchor [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1457.3999999999999s)]
*  lady saying a Biden blooper, okay, is once again, a hilarious, a hilarious demonstration of [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1465.0s)]
*  the one thing that Biden ran against Trump on successfully, which was that he would restore [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1474.76s)]
*  the confidence in our international allies and cooperators as like, and restore America's role [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1479.64s)]
*  as like the global hegemonic power that is the world police. And Biden has failed on that so [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1487.64s)]
*  spectacularly. Like every single person that is inside of the periphery, inside of the sphere of [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1494.76s)]
*  influence of the United States of America, basically has recognized that this old man [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1505.32s)]
*  is getting dog-walked by Benjamin Netanyahu, at least like in the way that it is interpreted. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1514.04s)]
*  These events are interpreted by everyone else where it is hilarious to watch the guy who was [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1518.6s)]
*  supposed to, you know, unlike Donald Trump, bring about stability to a chaotic reign. And now [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1525.6399999999999s)]
*  everyone sees him as an old man who's asleep at the wheel, who's getting dog-walked by Benjamin [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1532.28s)]
*  Netanyahu, who does whatever the he wants. And when Biden says like, oh, this is a target that [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1536.76s)]
*  this is a red line that we don't want Netanyahu to cross, Netanyahu crosses it anyway. They literally [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1543.48s)]
*  see what they see Biden's threats to Benjamin Netanyahu or Biden's red lines that Benjamin [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1549.56s)]
*  Netanyahu has a promise. I mean, which is a correct interpretation, of course, a correct [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1557.5600000000002s)]
*  interpretation of events, but pretty funny overall to think that it's coming from the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1563.48s)]
*  administration that was supposed to rebuild America's squandered reputation that Donald [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1569.24s)]
*  Trump destroyed at the global stage. Really cool and really funny to experience, in my opinion. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1575.3200000000002s)]
*  He did it. He did NATO. Iran is an oil rich nation. It has drilling facilities, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1581.72s)]
*  refineries and export terminals everywhere. But the sites you're seeing are only the major ones. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1587.4s)]
*  Israel's most obvious target would be the Kurg oil terminal. It's on an island in the Persian Gulf, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1593.88s)]
*  removed from the from the Iranian mainland. But more importantly, it's Tehran's biggest export hub [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1601.08s)]
*  by far. The Kurg oil terminal handles more than 90% of Iran's exports. That's millions of barrels [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1607.08s)]
*  every day being converted into essential funds to keep Iran's regime afloat. If this export stops, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1615.96s)]
*  Iran gets hammered economically. But this will also have a domino effect. Iran mostly sells oil [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1623.24s)]
*  to China. This is the part, this is the important part. If Tehran is forced to stop, Beijing will [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1628.84s)]
*  look elsewhere, causing prices to surge. And Joe Biden won't like that because oil prices are a [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1632.28s)]
*  sensitive topic this close to US elections. So Biden may try and stop Netanyahu from hitting [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1637.56s)]
*  the Kurg oil terminal. But there are other oil facilities as well, like the Abadan refinery near [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1643.6399999999999s)]
*  Iran's border with Iraq. This is a domestic facility. So if Israel attacks it, global prices [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1649.96s)]
*  may still remain stable. And Netanyahu will have his revenge. It's cynical because ordinary people [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1655.32s)]
*  will bear the brunt. But Israel may still consider it an option. There are other facilities too, of [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1661.96s)]
*  course, like the Kish and Kashmir islands near the Strait of Hormuz. These are smaller export hubs. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1667.24s)]
*  So attacking them- Is on your news coverage is Garbo compared to this. I know that's why I'm [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1674.28s)]
*  watching this. Regardless of this channel's like overarching views or whatever, this is a pretty, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1678.3600000000001s)]
*  this is the reason why the chatter sent it to me because like it's making a cold and calculated [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1685.32s)]
*  assessment of events that I think is good. ...would just be symbolic. But will that be enough [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1691.64s)]
*  for Prime Minister Netanyahu? As you can see, there are a lot of factors for Israel to consider. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1699.72s)]
*  And it will take action after thinking things through, hopefully. It's a tense situation [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1704.68s)]
*  because their next move has the potential to push West Asia over the edge and plunge the world into [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1709.3200000000002s)]
*  chaos. We're hoping it doesn't come to that. Global oil markets and global markets in general [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1715.08s)]
*  are feeling the pressure of all of this. Investors are rattled. There was a sell-off in the Indian [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1721.48s)]
*  stock markets. Both the Nifty and the Sensex were down. Yeah, so just buckle up for that. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1727.48s)]
*  All right, let's get back to Israel doing Israel shit in Lebanon though. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1733.48s)]
*  And Alex joins us live now from Jerusalem. Alex, it's being reported that the Israeli military is [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1737.8799999999999s)]
*  preparing its attack on Iran, but it's a question of what and when. Well, indeed it is. It's been [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1743.48s)]
*  reported, but nothing completely firm on that. Overnight, Joe Biden, the US president, again warned [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1748.44s)]
*  Israel against the high numbers of civilian casualties. Clearly the White House consider [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1755.08s)]
*  those unacceptably high, not just in Gaza, but now, of course, in Lebanon as well. And over the last [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1760.28s)]
*  few days, there's not exactly been a war of words, but cool exchanges between the White House and the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1765.88s)]
*  Israelis. A couple of days ago, Joe Biden pretty much telling Israel not to attack Iranian oil [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1770.52s)]
*  installations in reprisals for that Iranian missile attack this week into Israel. No response from [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1776.68s)]
*  Israel on that. Overnight, he said, well, if I was Israel, I wouldn't attack oil installations either. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1782.6s)]
*  Again, nothing, no promises from Israel on that. It is because when America invaded Iraq, they blew [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1789.96s)]
*  everything up with one exception, the Iraqi Ministry of Energy. Okay, that's it. That's all [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1796.92s)]
*  you need to know about how things work. Okay, you don't touch, you don't pick up the bag, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1805.0800000000002s)]
*  especially when your enemy has the capacity to do the same to you. This is the calculation. That's [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1811.8000000000002s)]
*  it. That's the calculation here for America, is that if Iran lights oil refineries on fire, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1817.3200000000002s)]
*  you will destabilize the entire marketplace, the entire, the entirety of the global market. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1824.28s)]
*  We can't have that. That's not good. And that's been a threat since day one, mind you, which is [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1830.04s)]
*  why I think it's so ridiculous that Biden hasn't packed up Benjamin Netanyahu already. I've been [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1834.52s)]
*  saying this for months. Considered imminent, we watch and we wait. Well, here with me now is our [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1839.56s)]
*  foreign affairs correspondent, Sukunda Kamani, who has just returned to Beirut from southern Lebanon. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1846.12s)]
*  Well, Chris, we've been hearing today further strikes, yet further strikes again in Beirut, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1852.0400000000002s)]
*  again concentrated in the south of the city. It seems that Israel is deliberately trying to [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1857.0800000000002s)]
*  prevent rescue workers reaching the site where they targeted Hashem Sefi Adin, the man tipped to be [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1862.68s)]
*  Hezbollah's new leader. Still no official confirmation as he was killed, but reports [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1868.2s)]
*  suggest that he has been out of contact with the rest of Hezbollah ever since those very powerful [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1873.0s)]
*  strikes on Thursday night. Now, as you say, we drove up from the southern city of Tyre earlier [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1878.36s)]
*  today, passing through, passing by towns and villages that Israel has ordered to evacuate. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1883.9599999999998s)]
*  Certainly they all looked very empty to us, and that's why there's such mounting concern [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1890.12s)]
*  about the displacement crisis here. And what's going on on the border itself? Well, a little [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1894.84s)]
*  hard to tell. The Israeli military say that they've killed 400 Hezbollah operatives since their ground [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1899.56s)]
*  incursion began. Hezbollah, for their part, say they've resisted once again Israeli incursion [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1904.76s)]
*  attempt at the, around the village of Edesa. Certainly we're not seeing Israeli forces sweep [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1910.28s)]
*  through southern Lebanon. Is that because they're concentrating their efforts just right on the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1916.76s)]
*  on the border? Is it because they're encountering more pushback from Hezbollah than they anticipated? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1921.96s)]
*  The Israeli military, military officials have been telling reporters in Israel that they want to try [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1927.48s)]
*  and wrap up the operation as soon as possible, potentially even within a number of weeks. One [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1932.76s)]
*  Western official I was speaking to today, though, expressing fears that we're just at the start of [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1937.48s)]
*  an open-ended conflict. Thanks, Akunda. Well, in the last few minutes, the Israeli military spokesperson [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1942.28s)]
*  hasn't shed any light on when there will be strikes, saying their response to Iran will come at a time [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1948.6s)]
*  Israel decides best. Well, joining me live now from Tel Aviv is Miri Aysen, who's a retired colonel [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1953.72s)]
*  in the Israel Defense Forces. She worked with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert during the last [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1959.56s)]
*  Lebanon war in 2006 and is now a fellow at the International Institute for Counterterrorism. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1964.6s)]
*  From the Israeli point of view, how is the invasion of southern Lebanon going and does it seem credible [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1970.9199999999998s)]
*  to you that it could all be wrapped up within a matter of weeks? It's funny how when I listen to [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1977.8799999999999s)]
*  the way you describe it as the invasion and then as it's going to go on and in, Israel from the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1981.72s)]
*  beginning had very specific targets in going into the small area of southern Lebanon that they [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1986.84s)]
*  chose to- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, totally. It's just a small military operation. Shut the up calling it [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1993.72s)]
*  an invasion, dude. We've killed 1,600 people in bombing campaigns so far. It's a special military [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=1999.0s)]
*  operation. It's a targeted special military operation, duh, to denazify Lebanon. ...go in. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2004.52s)]
*  And that was to both uncover, destroy, expose the Radwan forces cache of weapons that are right on [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2009.96s)]
*  the other side of the border. The idea of spokesperson right now, part of what he put out [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2017.32s)]
*  is some of those tunnels that lead directly from Lebanese territory into Israel. They were waiting [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2021.56s)]
*  to do an October 7th-type attack. That's what the idea of forces are trying to destroy. Right, and so- [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2027.24s)]
*  God, Monday is going to be unbearable. So, so- Why? It's October 7, dude. It'll mark the one year of [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2034.12s)]
*  Israel's genocide of Gaza and of Palestinians. Dude, if you think that the constant calls [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2042.12s)]
*  of October 7 are very annoying at this point, holy dude. Like, Israel's been pointing to October 7 to [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2052.68s)]
*  genocide the entirety of the Gazan population for the past 12 months. Oh my God. I'm sure they have [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2060.76s)]
*  a mass press blast ready to go. Do you think it could be done in a matter of weeks? Absolutely. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2067.5600000000004s)]
*  I also think it's something where you go in and you go out and that when we put the Hezbollah [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2072.6000000000004s)]
*  statements and what Hezbollah says on the same legitimacy level as what the IDF say at the end, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2077.5600000000004s)]
*  with all of our flaws and we have many, we are a Western democracy. And when we send out statements [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2084.5200000000004s)]
*  certainly when it comes into what's going on, it's our soldiers who are fighting, it's our Israelis [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2090.6s)]
*  who are not inside their towns and villages, and we have been very clear on what's going on there. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2095.16s)]
*  Hezbollah has attacked us every single day since October 8. They joined in then. The Radwan forces [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2100.04s)]
*  are deployed in the south of Lebanon and they have way more strength than what the Nukhba forces that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2107.08s)]
*  did the horrific attack of October 7th ever had. So, I look at what the IDF is doing. I most [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2112.92s)]
*  definitely see the locality of what they're doing. You come stand on the border. It's a kilometer [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2118.84s)]
*  from the border, a kilometer and a half. There are attacks further north because Hezbollah fighters [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2124.44s)]
*  are both trying to go north and they're trying to reinforce their own forces. It's on the double way [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2129.88s)]
*  and that would be to me part of why Israel is telling villagers to go north. It's about saving [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2135.48s)]
*  their lives. I have nothing good to say about war in general, but to try to help uninvolved civilians [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2141.2400000000002s)]
*  save their lives. You're literally an IDF military person. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2147.08s)]
*  Now, let's turn to the impending attack on Iran. Obviously, there are many things being said by [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2178.04s)]
*  Western leaders about what Israel should or shouldn't attack. You know, Joe Biden sort of [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2184.2799999999997s)]
*  suggesting it shouldn't be nuclear facilities. It shouldn't be oil installations. Donald Trump [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2190.7599999999998s)]
*  saying take out the nuclear installations first. I mean, how are these sorts of sentiments received [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2195.16s)]
*  in Israel? What do people in Israel want? So, we're on a Saturday night. We're at the end [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2200.2799999999997s)]
*  of a long Jewish holiday. It's our new year. We've all been in the Jewish holiday from Wednesday [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2204.84s)]
*  evening and this is after the Tuesday night attack direct from Iran. So, we're sitting here [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2210.6000000000004s)]
*  in that sense looking around and saying what will happen if they kill the Iranian leader is a question [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2216.52s)]
*  that someone asked. A lot of people here think that like, I think a lot of people here think that like [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2222.6000000000004s)]
*  the Iranian population across the board despises the leadership, which many do for good reason. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2228.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. And even if they do hate the Iranian leadership, they still also would absolutely [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2236.6s)]
*  treat an Israeli assassination of the Iranian leadership as a direct foreign military operation, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2244.2s)]
*  which is what it is. Okay. And it would only reaffirm the support for whatever the Iranian [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2252.44s)]
*  leadership looks like after this decapitation. It would be an act of war. It would galvanize the [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2259.48s)]
*  the most reactionary elements of Iranian society. It's the same principle behind the [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2266.68s)]
*  Ansar Allah administration. The greatest gift for the Houthis in Yemen was Israel's genocide of Gaza. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2272.28s)]
*  If you want to look at it in like cold and calculated terms without like thinking about [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2280.04s)]
*  the morality of it all, if you were like a hater of the Houthis or Ansar Allah, which many people [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2284.92s)]
*  were inside of Yemen, right? They all basically unified under the Ansar Allah banner in the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2290.36s)]
*  aftermath of Israel's genocide of the Palestinians. These are people who have experienced genocide [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2297.64s)]
*  themselves by Western forces. So when the leadership structure was like, we're going to [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2303.56s)]
*  do everything in our fucking power to resist American imperialism, resist Israeli imperialism, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2309.32s)]
*  and we're going to shut down the Red Sea. Okay. Obviously, obviously when that happens, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2313.88s)]
*  people are going to be like, oh yeah, no, these guys are doing the right thing. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2318.6800000000003s)]
*  And beyond that, obviously there's still plenty of like real popular support for the the Ayatollah [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2322.84s)]
*  as well. I know this from the great, like the greatest comparison I can make here is Turkey. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2329.0800000000004s)]
*  Recep Tayyip Erdogan became profoundly popular. He's always retained like at least 51% support [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2337.3199999999997s)]
*  throughout most of his reign. Now that is going away in the last couple of years due to hyper [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2343.8799999999997s)]
*  inflation in the country and whatnot. But in the aftermath of the coup that happened in Turkey, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2350.7599999999998s)]
*  the failed coup that happened in Turkey, he was able to put together a referendum and change the [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2355.9599999999996s)]
*  constitution of the country, implement martial law, and plenty of people were on his side because [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2362.84s)]
*  all of a sudden, all of a sudden people were like, okay, this is an outside force that is like trying [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2368.28s)]
*  to change our affairs. This is not something that Americans can ever understand because at most, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2372.92s)]
*  at most the only thing you experience is like Russia buying like $2 million worth of Facebook [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2381.32s)]
*  ads or some you just don't, you don't really, you don't really see it. Whenever a much larger force [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2386.28s)]
*  interferes in the affairs of a foreign nation in a devastating manner, especially one that leads [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2392.04s)]
*  to like death of the civilian population. If that force already has like a decent amount of popularity [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2397.96s)]
*  within the within the population, more and more people end up more and more people end up [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2404.04s)]
*  subscribing to the, the leadership structure. Even if they were previously in disagreement with said [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2410.2799999999997s)]
*  leadership, even if they were previously fighting against the leadership, does that make sense? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2418.12s)]
*  I guess you could see that with like George W. Bush post 9 11. So to answer your question, if, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2423.56s)]
*  if Israel was to successfully kill like a bunch of the bunch of the, the Iranian leadership structure, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2429.4s)]
*  there would be a, there would definitely be a point of chaos. There would definitely be a bunch. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2436.92s)]
*  There would definitely be chaos immediately because there's plenty of people that are [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2442.2799999999997s)]
*  um, genuinely and understandably resentful towards the current leadership in Iran. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2446.68s)]
*  They would probably put down those protests in unimaginably violent ways. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2454.2799999999997s)]
*  And then they would move forward with their destruction campaign against Israel. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2459.08s)]
*  We are in a multi front war, but we've been there, sir, for many, many months, almost from [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2465.56s)]
*  October 7th, the Yemen Houthis joined in the Iraqi Shiites have fired at us, the Shiites in Syria, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2472.2799999999997s)]
*  let alone Hezbollah from day one Hamas and of course Iran. So when we talk about the response, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2479.3199999999997s)]
*  it's understanding that we are in a multi front war, but the one that's behind all of the weaponry, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2485.3999999999996s)]
*  the UAVs, the suicide drones, the ICBMs, the cruise missiles, all of those come from the Islamic [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2491.8799999999997s)]
*  regime of Iran. So I think we all expect an attack. We don't say not the Islamic regime of Iran [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2498.2s)]
*  Khamenei this Friday stood and both praised, praised the October 7th attack of Hamas. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2505.48s)]
*  And, and when we talk about the different why I can't believe they did that. Hmm. That's crazy. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2512.9199999999996s)]
*  They're all in it together. What they all, um, I want to say having common to me, it's such a [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2518.68s)]
*  horrible thing. Having common is that they want to destroy, annihilate the state of Israel and [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2523.64s)]
*  they physically are trying to do so. So I do expect a response. Israelis do expect a response, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2529.0s)]
*  but I have no idea what that would be. Marie Eisen, thank you very much. Well, earlier I spoke [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2534.2s)]
*  to the shadow security minister, Tom Tugendhat in the UK, one of the four remaining conservative [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2538.44s)]
*  leadership contenders who worked here in Beirut for a while before joining the army and serving [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2544.2799999999997s)]
*  in both Afghanistan and Iraq. I asked him with Israel warning that it's counterattack on Iran [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2549.48s)]
*  is imminent. What should Britain's message to Israel be? Well, we need to be offering leadership [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2555.32s)]
*  in the region and that's why we need to be asking British citizens to leave as soon as possible [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2560.68s)]
*  and offering leadership in the region to make sure that Israel's response is proportionate [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2565.64s)]
*  and targeted. What does proportionate and targeted mean? Does that mean avoiding the nuclear sites, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2570.52s)]
*  avoiding the oil installation? Bro, they're so America, like that's a carbon copy, dude. They [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2577.0s)]
*  are dude, dude. England is not a real country, bro. I'm sorry. The most American nation, holy dude. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2583.08s)]
*  Yes, we must listen to reason, which is why we are trying to get our citizens away from the line of [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2590.12s)]
*  fire. Fire coming from Israel, our ally that we're giving weapons to. And that's right. This is what [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2598.28s)]
*  good leadership looks like. Very nice. Well, what it means is making sure that they're targeting [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2605.72s)]
*  those areas that enable Iran to conduct this violent aggression against Israel and actually [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2611.56s)]
*  against other countries in the region. I mean, let's not forget that Iran hasn't just brought [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2618.4399999999996s)]
*  or tried to bring death to Israel. They have actually through Lebanese Hezbollah, through [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2623.3199999999997s)]
*  their proxies in Bashar al-Assad. I just don't get it. Why didn't they? This streamer isn't very smart. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2627.3999999999996s)]
*  Just unintelligent remarks. Buckle in chatter. Here's one intelligent take for you at the top [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2632.7599999999998s)]
*  of the hour. There's a three minute break and you should probably subscribe right now for $6 or for [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2637.88s)]
*  free with the Twitch prime by connecting your Amazon prime account to your Twitch account [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2642.2s)]
*  to avoid the three minute break at the top of the hour. Maybe if you're lucky, you can get [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2646.7599999999998s)]
*  gifted as well. Here's the three minute break now. Also follow up to that. I would love for you to [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2649.96s)]
*  specifically point out exactly what you disagree with instead of saying this streamer isn't very [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2655.7999999999997s)]
*  smart. No good takes, just unintelligent remarks. That would be great. I would love to have a [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2660.12s)]
*  productive dialogue with you, my friend. Assad's government in Syria and Iraq, they have murdered [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2663.72s)]
*  quite literally hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of Sunni Muslims across the region. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2669.48s)]
*  So it is in British interest that this war does not grow and become a full-scale regional conflict. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2675.7999999999997s)]
*  That's absolutely right. It is in our interest to make sure that this is as controlled, as [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2682.04s)]
*  proportionate as possible. But let's be clear, the Israeli government has the right to protect [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2686.76s)]
*  its citizens. The Jordanian government has the right to protect its citizens and others have [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2691.88s)]
*  the right to take action against these non-state actors. Look, the Lebanese armed forces moved [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2697.8s)]
*  quickly in the last few days to disarm and expel Lebanese Hezbollah from various areas, including [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2701.7200000000003s)]
*  areas like the airport where they have formerly had control. Of course, all of this goes back to [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2707.2400000000002s)]
*  Gaza. Should Britain be more vocal in expressing its concern over alleged war crimes in Gaza? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2712.04s)]
*  Britain should be doing everything that we can to protect and support the Palestinian people. And [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2719.8s)]
*  one of the things that we need to be doing is pushing for the two-state solution. Look, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2724.6s)]
*  all of this relies on the respect for... It's so cool that every single mouthpiece of like [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2728.84s)]
*  the American state or Western states is repeating the same... [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2736.12s)]
*  Trying to divide Muslims, by the way, Shia and Sunni. This is the latest instruction from [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2743.0s)]
*  Hasbra. It doesn't... No Muslim gives a... straight up. I don't even think the Saudis care that much. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2746.6s)]
*  At this point, outside of people in positions of power and even then, the pro-Israel sentiment is [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2753.96s)]
*  diminishing. No one cares. First of all, Hamas is Sunni. They are at the heart of this. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2762.2s)]
*  Palestinians are Sunni. Nobody gives a... Only Westerners talk about it on these terms. No, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2768.6s)]
*  no one cares. Chatters, please stop. But the Shia and Sunni are already divided, not united. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2774.6s)]
*  Okay? No, it is... There is no like... I wouldn't say that there is like a monolithic attitude [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2778.76s)]
*  towards anything in the entirety of the Muslim world, which spans across multiple continents and [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2786.84s)]
*  is, you know, billions of people. But even in the region, it's like, like the Houthis are a great [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2794.28s)]
*  example. They're Shia. El-Hasanite. Okay. No one... No, like a lot of old traditionals give it about [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2801.4s)]
*  the Sunni and Shia. No, dude. The Houthis are Shia and literally one of the more... One of the most [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2808.0400000000004s)]
*  popular groups in the entire region now. It does not fucking matter. When it comes to Israel, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2814.6800000000003s)]
*  it does not matter. Of course, the Israeli community, but also the Palestinian community. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2820.28s)]
*  But what Hamas did in Gaza was utterly criminal. It was utterly vile. And I don't just mean on [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2825.0800000000004s)]
*  October the 7th, a year ago, almost a year ago today, but actually what they did over the months [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2831.1600000000003s)]
*  and years before that, Hamas murdered many Palestinians to take control of Gaza. Just finally, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2837.32s)]
*  I mean, as you know, as this war, as these wars grow and go on, there is a tendency among... [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2844.2s)]
*  Dude, what is your takeaway from this? If not, only Israel gets the murder Palestinians. No one else. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2851.24s)]
*  Angloid animal is right. Like, this is his response to the Israeli war crimes is that, well, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2857.64s)]
*  Hamas has killed Palestinians too. Are you complaining that Hamas is kill stealing? Like, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2863.7999999999997s)]
*  what the fuck's wrong with you? A lot of people back home to look away and to say, look, this is [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2868.2s)]
*  the Middle East. It's the Middle East doing what the Middle East does. What is your message to [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2872.52s)]
*  people at home about why this matters to them? I mean, this kind of attitude was, I guess, really [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2876.28s)]
*  silly if you were knowledgeable on the matter even after October 7th, but plenty of people weren't. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2882.84s)]
*  Plenty of people weren't knowledgeable after October 7th, so they kind of got duped by this [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2889.08s)]
*  kind of sentiment. But it's been 12 months, dude. 12 months of straight up hell. 12 months of death [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2893.64s)]
*  and destruction. I don't think anybody believes that at this point. Oh, Israel is trying to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2899.56s)]
*  liberate Palestinians from Hamas? Like, get the fuck out of here, dude. If you still believe that [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2904.84s)]
*  at this point, you just are... I mean, you don't care. I don't think anyone that advances that [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2909.56s)]
*  argument is advancing it with sincerity. That's it. Well, look, Krishnan, I started my career as [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2916.2799999999997s)]
*  a journalist in Beirut. I was a journalist there from 97 to 99, and I was covering various elements [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2923.32s)]
*  of the wars in the south of Lebanon. And one of the things that struck me then and still strikes me [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2929.08s)]
*  today is that it's not foreign. It's not that far away. The reality is that the energy price [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2933.64s)]
*  fights that happen when there's conflict in the Middle East affect us at home. And when we see [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2939.56s)]
*  rises in non-state actors like Lebanese Hezbollah, we see very often the threat of terrorism in the [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2944.12s)]
*  United Kingdom increase. And I can tell you as security minister that we were extremely [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2949.24s)]
*  conscious of the cooperation that we needed with our partners in the Middle East in order to keep [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2954.6s)]
*  the British people safe. So I'm afraid we may wish it away, but the reality is that we are [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2958.76s)]
*  fundamentally connected and we need to be leading in the conversations and the security conversations [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2963.8s)]
*  in particular to keep ourselves safe. And that's exactly what the UK's position should be, because [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2968.6800000000003s)]
*  we should be standing with our allies and stopping these terror groups from getting any more [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2974.44s)]
*  oxygen or power or support from violent dictatorships like the Iranian regime that they've had for 40 [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2979.88s)]
*  years. Of course, he's admitting that the only thing he cares about is like low oil prices. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2985.56s)]
*  I respect the honesty. It's good. What is this Al Jazeera breaking? Urgent Israeli broadcasting [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2991.96s)]
*  authority about a quarter of Israelis said they thought about leaving the country during the past [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=2997.7999999999997s)]
*  year. Good, good. Strikes in Beirut suburbs now. Like the thing is this is good because [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3001.24s)]
*  this completely like diminishes the Zionist project. That's it. If you don't have enough [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3008.6s)]
*  people to build additional settlements, if you don't have enough people to build additional [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3014.44s)]
*  settlements, you no longer can do a Zionist project. You don't have like it don't matter [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3019.96s)]
*  how many Russians you give Israeli citizenship to. Only the most hardcore will remain. Yeah, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3025.88s)]
*  I know. The most hardcore also don't know how to read dog is fine. Israel is bouldering towards [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3030.6s)]
*  becoming the the ultra the rabid ultra nationalist ultra Zionist, the the ultra orthodox state that [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3036.52s)]
*  it was it has been able to successfully make it seem like it's an outside element. But once everyone [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3042.84s)]
*  is the hawk to a Rastafarian inbred dudes that you see, people are going to be like, yeah, I don't I [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3049.88s)]
*  don't think this is tenable. I don't think this is manageable. We should probably not align with them [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3057.8s)]
*  in the same way. It destroys their economy. This is why academic divestment matters. Okay, academic [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3062.44s)]
*  boycotts, academic divestments, like they play a massive role in the soft power capabilities of [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3068.28s)]
*  Israel. That soft power pays dividends back to Israel. When you're wondering like, why are there [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3074.6000000000004s)]
*  so many people who are just so unconditionally pro Israel in American media or in all of these [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3082.52s)]
*  institutions? Like, why are there so many people? It's because Israel for years and years and years [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3090.28s)]
*  has created this ecosystem where they have a lot of the pro Israeli sentiment baked into these [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3096.04s)]
*  institutions. When you when you literally sever that tie, all of a sudden, it's much easier for [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3103.0s)]
*  people to look at a bunch of inbred a bunch of inbred author or ultra orthodox dudes trying to [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3110.36s)]
*  run over the the Lebanese border to go and build a settlement and getting quick scoped [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3116.12s)]
*  by some Hezbollah dude. When that becomes the entirety of the Israeli nation state, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3124.2799999999997s)]
*  it's impossible for them to maintain this posture that they're like, you know, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3129.48s)]
*  simultaneously a Western facing nation that is directly trying to fight back against the [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3134.12s)]
*  barbarism of Islam. They they are susceptible to brain drain just like any other country is. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psYi2_FVl18&t=3140.2s)]
