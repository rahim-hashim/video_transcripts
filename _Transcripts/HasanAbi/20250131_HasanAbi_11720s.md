# Visiting Japanese Communist Party HQ
**HasanAbi:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI)
*  Well, we have some symbols. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=0.0s)]
*  What are the symbols? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3.6s)]
*  Symbols are... [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6.0s)]
*  This is, of course, rice. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  And this is the, you know, card. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10.0s)]
*  So this is the union of the peasants and workers, you know, traditionally. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=14.0s)]
*  And those four flags are... [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=22.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know... I don't remember the sequences, but... [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=26.0s)]
*  Independence, democracy, and international solidarity, and also a strong party organization. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=35.0s)]
*  You got everything you asked for. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=51.0s)]
*  Yes, the overlay's back, Chad, I know. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=53.0s)]
*  But then more. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=55.0s)]
*  More than you asked for. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=57.0s)]
*  Okay, we're taking... [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=59.0s)]
*  Oh, you know how the directions... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=61.0s)]
*  I'll let you... [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=63.0s)]
*  Why am I not able to... What the hell is this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=67.0s)]
*  Okay, public transport, Hibiya line to the OEO line. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=69.0s)]
*  Oh, it's the worst. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like right in the f***ing middle, too. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=76.0s)]
*  Let me see if I can fix it on here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=78.0s)]
*  I'm gonna have to do it on remote. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=80.0s)]
*  Okay, I can guide us in the meantime. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=82.0s)]
*  Sure, alright, let's do that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah, you guide. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=86.0s)]
*  What's the addy, though? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=88.0s)]
*  Oh, it's... Here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=90.0s)]
*  Here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=92.0s)]
*  Let me see if I still have it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=94.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=96.0s)]
*  Right there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=98.0s)]
*  I linked it to you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=100.0s)]
*  Why does everything have to always be so f***ing difficult, dude? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=102.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=106.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=108.0s)]
*  It's not. It's gonna be daijoubu. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=110.0s)]
*  Okay, let's go on the remote desktop. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=112.0s)]
*  I'll shut off the overlay for now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=116.0s)]
*  Hopefully I'll be able to do that here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=118.0s)]
*  In other news... [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=124.0s)]
*  Oh, let's go, I already got this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=126.0s)]
*  In other news, I've also got that s*** on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=128.0s)]
*  In case anyone was wondering. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=130.0s)]
*  In case there was any doubt... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=132.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=134.0s)]
*  But I know there was never any doubt. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=136.0s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=138.0s)]
*  I did it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=140.0s)]
*  Is this the remedy to go? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=142.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=144.0s)]
*  Alright, so, Chad, we're on our way to the Japanese Communist Party right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=146.0s)]
*  To the Japanese Communist Party headquarters. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=150.0s)]
*  I'm with a couple friends beforehand. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=152.0s)]
*  I believe one of them, at least. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=154.0s)]
*  If not two of them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=156.0s)]
*  Both are researchers, academics, living in Japan. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=158.0s)]
*  One of them actually is writing a dissertation on the Japanese Communist Party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=160.0s)]
*  And we've had this wonderful unprecedented level of access considering the Japanese Communist Party. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=164.0s)]
*  And most political parties in Japan's attitude overall, or I guess like specifically with the Japanese Communist Party [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=172.0s)]
*  given its history of repression, political repression from the government. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=180.0s)]
*  It's a somewhat secretive institution overall. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=184.0s)]
*  But as someone who is obviously fascinated with politics in general, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=190.0s)]
*  I am particularly interested in understanding modern Japanese politics from the perspective of the Communist Party. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=196.0s)]
*  It is a very active party still in terms of global Communist parties outside of places like India or China or the Global South. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=204.0s)]
*  Japan obviously is a country whose constitution was written by the United States of America. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=214.0s)]
*  And therefore, it is very interesting to see how political mobilization works and political action works in a country like this one. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=222.0s)]
*  For obvious reasons, I want to understand it considering my background as an American. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=234.0s)]
*  And even my background as a Turkish person as well. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=240.0s)]
*  There's probably a better fitting analog there when you compare Turkey and communist development, communist political actions in a country like Turkey. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=244.0s)]
*  We're on platform one. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=254.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=256.0s)]
*  Is that ours? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=270.0s)]
*  There's no train there. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=286.0s)]
*  Oh, you're right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=290.0s)]
*  1035 is the next train. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=294.0s)]
*  Four minutes. We're late. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=300.0s)]
*  So we missed it and we're going to be late. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=302.0s)]
*  I think we're not going to be late overall, but we're not going to be bright and early with bells on. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=306.0s)]
*  Which is what we want. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=312.0s)]
*  We're going to be there seven minutes early. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=315.0s)]
*  Smudge. Sorry, Chad. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=317.0s)]
*  Just kidding. The smudge on the sensor. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=319.0s)]
*  Just don't look at it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=324.0s)]
*  Can you imagine if I could turn off the overlay and I had to do this interview with the Haas overlay on? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=326.0s)]
*  Crazy stuff. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=332.0s)]
*  Debatably better. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=334.0s)]
*  What? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=335.0s)]
*  Arguably better. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=337.0s)]
*  But that is the situation in front of us right now, Chad. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=339.0s)]
*  I think for all the political political political heads, I think that this is exactly in the wheelhouse. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=344.0s)]
*  The merger between, you know, real life events, IRL streaming and also politics in general. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=352.0s)]
*  It's going to be interesting. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=364.0s)]
*  What did the overlay pop up and off again? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=366.0s)]
*  For a brief moment, I guess Haas is in here now. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=369.0s)]
*  He didn't like you talking this shit. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=372.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=374.0s)]
*  Is the Haas in the room with us now? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=376.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=378.0s)]
*  This jacket, albeit very cool, definitely is not warm enough, I will say. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=395.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=401.0s)]
*  I thought that I could be able to, I thought I would be fine as long as I had the undergarments. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=405.0s)]
*  But drip check overall. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=416.0s)]
*  Day 11 of the Burger Reich. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=420.0s)]
*  We're out here in occupied Japanese territory. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=422.0s)]
*  Still currently occupied by the American Empire and the imperialist forces in a nation whose constitution was written in the aftermath of World War II by that said imperial nation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=427.0s)]
*  And we're going to try and get March deported today. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=439.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=444.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=445.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=446.0s)]
*  The goal of this exercise. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=447.0s)]
*  The goal of this exercise today was actually not to go and interview the JCP. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=449.0s)]
*  It was actually to make sure that March can never set foot on Japanese soil ever again. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=454.0s)]
*  But that means you can't either. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=460.0s)]
*  I have my ways. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=462.0s)]
*  I'll figure it out. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=464.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=466.0s)]
*  I am not showing my ways on camera. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=468.0s)]
*  I'm not speaking shit. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=471.0s)]
*  I'm going to be the quietest you've ever heard. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=473.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter because everyone knows your participation. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=476.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=478.0s)]
*  You're filming. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=479.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be anybody. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=480.0s)]
*  It's Finn. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=481.0s)]
*  My name is Finn. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=482.0s)]
*  My name is Finn and we're from TK. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=483.0s)]
*  March. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=485.0s)]
*  Identity theft is a crime. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=487.0s)]
*  Wow, it's slam. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=489.0s)]
*  The train is packed. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=491.0s)]
*  Alright, I'm going. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=499.0s)]
*  I love the barriers where people don't fall. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=501.0s)]
*  It's also the mixed suicide barrier. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=503.0s)]
*  It's fast. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=505.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=506.0s)]
*  Wow, everyone is emptying out here. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=514.0s)]
*  How many stops? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=528.0s)]
*  Three. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=529.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=530.0s)]
*  And then we get in another train. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=531.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=533.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=534.0s)]
*  How are you feeling today? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=535.0s)]
*  What did you guys do last night? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=537.0s)]
*  Oh, I am violently hungover. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=538.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=542.0s)]
*  I was out until like four in the morning. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=543.0s)]

*  Oh, it's one stop. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=559.0s)]
*  And then we get on another one. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=561.0s)]
*  Four of three stops. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=563.0s)]
*  Are you going to be playing that? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=573.0s)]
*  Are you going to bring that up? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=576.0s)]
*  I will, of course. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=578.0s)]
*  For those who don't know, I'm currently singing the Japanese Communist Party's anime anthem. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=580.0s)]

*  Someone in the chat said, can someone please explain what ZinMalek is about? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=619.0s)]
*  I tried Googling it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=622.0s)]
*  It's the joke chatter. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=624.0s)]
*  They're calling me ZinMalek because of my beautiful eyebrows. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=626.0s)]
*  Denim's Ray? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=633.0s)]

*  Lots of content. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=649.0s)]
*  Lots of content. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=651.0s)]
*  Cake and boobies. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=658.0s)]
*  This is it? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=667.0s)]
*  For the newcomer chatters, I don't want to freak you out, but... [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=670.0s)]
*  Today, we are going to the Japanese Communist Party. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=674.0s)]
*  I know that if you watched a particular YouTube video from someone with no political understanding whatsoever, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=679.0s)]
*  it might have been used as a punchline that I might have sympathies. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=687.0s)]
*  It might have been used as a... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=699.0s)]
*  Where do we go? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=701.0s)]
*  We're going to the Oedo Line, the red one. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=703.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=705.0s)]
*  It might have been used as a punchline as a scary thing, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=706.0s)]
*  which, you know, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=711.0s)]
*  this scary thing that I readily talk about openly, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=714.0s)]
*  but... [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=719.0s)]
*  We are going to be doing something scary today. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=722.0s)]
*  We're going to be talking to some real-life communists. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=725.0s)]
*  So, I just wanted to issue a trigger warning prior, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=727.0s)]
*  if that's something that might be a little too scary for you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=730.0s)]
*  Just letting you know. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=735.0s)]
*  Ooh, Snackies? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=739.0s)]
*  What? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=741.0s)]
*  Buy me a coffee. Just kidding. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=743.0s)]
*  I need a coffee too, but we'll rip it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=745.0s)]
*  Maybe we'll get it there. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=747.0s)]
*  Do they have... [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=749.0s)]
*  They have a cafeteria, I believe. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=750.0s)]
*  Ooh, okay. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=752.0s)]
*  Yeah, don't push other people's luggage. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=758.0s)]
*  I love pushing other people's luggage. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=760.0s)]
*  I do, too. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=762.0s)]
*  Japan's so cool, dog. They thought of everything. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=766.0s)]
*  Even this. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=769.0s)]
*  Japanese zin doesn't taste as good. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=775.0s)]
*  I'll be asking them about this as well. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=778.0s)]
*  Why no American zin? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=782.0s)]
*  What's that about? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=785.0s)]
*  Where are we going? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=795.0s)]
*  This way, chat. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=797.0s)]

*  Platform two. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=809.0s)]
*  You don't gotta say it like that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=811.0s)]
*  Platform... [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=813.0s)]
*  Wait, what? Why am I... [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=815.0s)]
*  That's the right way to say it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=817.0s)]
*  Platform two. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=819.0s)]
*  Platform two. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=821.0s)]
*  What? Why am I... [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=823.0s)]
*  That's the right way to say it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=824.0s)]
*  It's so nice and warm. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=826.0s)]
*  I went to a... [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=828.0s)]
*  A Michelin star restaurant inside of our hotel last night. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=832.0s)]
*  Oh, the Jade Room? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=835.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=836.0s)]
*  I didn't mean to go there. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=837.0s)]
*  The food was fantastic. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=838.0s)]
*  I did, however, fall asleep at the meal. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=840.0s)]
*  At the meal? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=843.0s)]
*  Yes, and the manager came over and said, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=844.0s)]
*  Would you like for us to hurry it up for you? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=846.0s)]
*  How did you manage that? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=850.0s)]
*  I was that tired, March. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=852.0s)]
*  What time was this at? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=854.0s)]
*  Be honest. Be so for real right now. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=858.0s)]
*  Ten. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=860.0s)]
*  That means nine. It was nine, chat. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=862.0s)]
*  No, no, no. It wasn't. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=864.0s)]
*  Well, I started at dinner at nine, but I fell asleep at ten. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=866.0s)]
*  Meanwhile... [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=870.0s)]
*  Cut to me at three a.m. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=871.0s)]
*  Music bumping. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=873.0s)]
*  Okay, to be fair, I do wake up at four a.m. every morning. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=874.0s)]
*  Drinks were flowing. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=878.0s)]
*  I wake up at four a.m. when you go to sleep. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=879.0s)]
*  Last time. It was so sick. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=881.0s)]
*  I wasn't even with anybody. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=883.0s)]
*  I was with a couple friends, but not the one that we came with. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=884.0s)]
*  I just unplugged in Japan like that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=887.0s)]
*  I just got homies. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=889.0s)]
*  Did you see Rhyme? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=890.0s)]
*  Yeah, we went to see Rhyme, and then I went to somewhere else after. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=892.0s)]
*  Platform 2. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=899.0s)]
*  I can't read chat, but I know everybody is pogging at my very sick lifestyle. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=900.0s)]
*  No, they are. They definitely are. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=910.0s)]
*  They think you're the coolest. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=912.0s)]
*  I think you're the coolest. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=914.0s)]
*  And they're right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=916.0s)]
*  Shibuya Line. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=917.0s)]
*  I really do it all. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=919.0s)]
*  Rave till four a.m. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=920.0s)]

*  It's coming in three minutes. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=925.0s)]
*  Three stops we ride for, and then we're out in the station that we're supposed to meet up with the boys at. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=929.0s)]
*  They're probably watching. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=935.0s)]
*  Wait, so who are these people? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=936.0s)]
*  They're academics out here. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=937.0s)]
*  Sick. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=940.0s)]
*  I dropped out of college. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=941.0s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=944.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got a little bit of a headache. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=947.0s)]
*  I'm not sure what's going on. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=949.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got motion like that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=952.0s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=954.0s)]
*  Very cinematic shot here. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=960.0s)]
*  They aren't expecting us until eleven, but we can chat before that outside of police camera reach. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=969.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other thing I was going to do. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=974.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=977.0s)]
*  Unrelated. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=978.0s)]
*  Did you confirm a camera? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=979.0s)]
*  Um, I asked her. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=982.0s)]
*  Let's see if she responded. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=987.0s)]
*  Because otherwise I might jump. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=993.0s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=995.0s)]
*  Oh, she threw a thumbs up. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=998.0s)]
*  Yeah, APM. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=999.0s)]
*  Was it like a passive aggressive thumbs up? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1001.0s)]
*  Like, why do you guys keep changing the schedule on us? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1003.0s)]

*  I'm not the one that's falling apart here. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1013.0s)]
*  Do you want coffee right now? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1017.0s)]
*  No, we're going to get JCP coffee. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1019.0s)]
*  Is there a bath over here? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1021.0s)]
*  You have like 60 seconds to use it if there is. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1023.0s)]
*  I want to rip a piss, but I'm not going to do that. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1026.0s)]
*  I don't know if I can hold it until JCP. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1029.0s)]
*  So cute. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1053.0s)]
*  Watch out. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1054.0s)]
*  Chibi, watch out. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1055.0s)]
*  Yeah, that actually stopped me. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1056.0s)]
*  They're going to love your eyebrows. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1061.0s)]
*  Cinema. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1077.0s)]

*  Cinema. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1087.0s)]
*  USA needs platform gates? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1088.0s)]
*  Oh, to stop people from being pushed in to the tracks? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1089.0s)]
*  That would cost money, so we're not going to do that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1092.0s)]
*  Oh, Susan. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1099.0s)]
*  I'm going to go to the bathroom. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1100.0s)]
*  I hope someone had warmed it up for me. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1109.0s)]
*  You Russian ass in the bathroom, they'll know you aren't intentionally late. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1114.0s)]
*  Oh, that's very good. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1118.0s)]

*  Arm seat nasty. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1130.0s)]
*  Marsh doing a little polite voice. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1133.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1134.0s)]
*  Japan is perfect at the art of bad politics, conservatives with trains running on time. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1141.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1145.0s)]
*  This is a super fluid. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1150.0s)]
*  It is a super fluid moment. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1151.0s)]
*  It is a super fluid moment. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1156.0s)]
*  You're just giving directions to the trains there? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1161.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1163.0s)]
*  That's our ETA card. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1168.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1170.0s)]
*  What exit should we meet at? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1182.0s)]
*  Our buddies today are going to be Jeffrey and Romeo. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1196.0s)]
*  Jeffrey will be there tagging along, but he's not actually going to be doing anything. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1202.0s)]
*  Romeo, on the other hand, will also be helpful in interpretation. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1206.0s)]
*  What is wrong with my brain? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1215.0s)]
*  Also, I didn't do the GeoGuessr stream. It's tomorrow. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1217.0s)]
*  Wait, so you do have to move this? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1220.0s)]
*  Well, we moved it 30 minutes. It's not like we were able to move it a lot anyway. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1222.0s)]
*  I'm on a tight schedule today. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1227.0s)]
*  I have a lot of work to do. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1231.0s)]
*  What do you have to do after this? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1233.0s)]
*  I have to go across town and film an episode of my favorite podcast, Press Escape. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1234.0s)]
*  With the guy who walks across Japan and has a nice cute Shiba. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1243.0s)]
*  That dude is amazing. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1247.0s)]
*  He's a cooler guest than we ever get, honestly. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1248.0s)]
*  You know, that's major. I won't disrespect Kaho like that. Kaho's pretty sick. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1249.0s)]
*  Yeah, well you already did disrespect her like that, so... [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1253.0s)]
*  I mean, Kaho pulled up her Shiba, so... [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1258.0s)]
*  She's just DMing. She's watching the stream. She's very upset with you. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1260.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1267.0s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1269.0s)]
*  Caroline Ponn is a GoHost. Did Valkyrie know that? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1270.0s)]
*  Did you just Valky leak on your own? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1276.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, the chat seems to know, so I think Valky leaked. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1279.0s)]
*  Maybe Caroline Karelai leaked. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1284.0s)]
*  Caroline. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1286.0s)]
*  That head to shoulder ratio is insane. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1290.0s)]
*  Chat, we've moved beyond making head to shoulder ratio jokes. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1293.0s)]
*  Why? Because it's seen as a good thing in Japan. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1297.0s)]
*  I think... [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1302.0s)]
*  Maybe he was government-y. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1303.0s)]
*  I think that I am going to... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1306.0s)]
*  I think that I'm going to impress them with my incredible disparity. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1309.0s)]
*  They are going to see my shoulder to head ratio and will be shocked. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1313.0s)]
*  I've changed my mind. Those eyebrows really did great. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1330.0s)]
*  I don't have enough movement on them as much now though. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1335.0s)]
*  Like I feel like back in the day, you know, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1338.0s)]
*  before the eyebrow haircut that I got, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1340.0s)]
*  I was more expressive. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1347.0s)]
*  Why did you wash off everything they put on? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1352.0s)]
*  Why did you wash away all their good and bad work? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1354.0s)]
*  Dude, I immediately... [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1356.0s)]
*  I ran into the shower at first. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1358.0s)]
*  After that experience. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1362.0s)]
*  Was it running in the water? Was it just like black? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1364.0s)]
*  I mean, I used a make-up remover. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1366.0s)]
*  But, no, we're on our way to the Communist Party right now. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1376.0s)]
*  The fine beard looks... The rest is fine. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1382.0s)]
*  Crazy how good the connection is on the side of the face. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1390.0s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and do a little bit of a face-to-face chat. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1392.0s)]
*  Crazy how good the connection is on the subway over there. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1394.0s)]
*  No way that it happened in New York City. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1396.0s)]
*  When you started on Twitch, your eyebrows looked more like this. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1402.0s)]
*  They were smaller. That's crazy. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1404.0s)]
*  I don't think my eyebrows grew. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1408.0s)]
*  So, um, this is... Wait. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1418.0s)]
*  How many stops? Three stops. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1421.0s)]
*  So this sub is the one we're getting off at. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1423.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1425.0s)]
*  We're going to A2. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1439.0s)]
*  I'm just a chill guy. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1443.0s)]
*  When you guys insult me, is this who you're insulting, by the way? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1445.0s)]
*  Just a chill guy. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1447.0s)]
*  How I receive great name insults. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1457.0s)]

*  but I think Hideo Kojima is a party member. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1718.32s)]
*  Well don't out him like that. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1722.12s)]
*  I mean I'm not like working on any information that I got from them or anything. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1724.1599999999999s)]
*  I have not communicated with the Japanese Communist Party. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1729.1999999999998s)]
*  Are you going to ask them about that? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1731.56s)]
*  Of course not, because they will literally not tell me. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1734.0800000000002s)]
*  They're... [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1737.1200000000001s)]
*  They're somewhat secretive. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  You have a friend. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1740.8s)]

*  I'm Romeo. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1745.8400000000001s)]
*  Hi Romeo. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1748.3200000000002s)]
*  Nice to meet you in person brother, how are you doing? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1749.3200000000002s)]
*  Are you cool to be on camera? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1751.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah I'm good. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1753.24s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1753.96s)]
*  Hi Romeo. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1754.48s)]
*  This is Romeo, you're working on the JCP. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well a little bit actually, just a chapter in my dissertation, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1758.04s)]
*  because I heard you on a podcast saying my dissertation is about the JCP. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1761.56s)]
*  My bad. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1765.28s)]
*  That's not quite right. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1765.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's Jeff's fault. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1766.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's Jeff's fault. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1768.08s)]
*  That's how he presented it. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1769.0s)]
*  Jeff is right out there already I think. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1770.32s)]
*  So what is your dissertation about? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1773.24s)]
*  It's about the opposition in JAPO in Japan, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1774.92s)]
*  and kind of like what do you do with an opposition that never wins? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1777.36s)]
*  That's really interesting, because that's what I directly want to ask them. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1780.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1785.68s)]
*  So I guess you're the perfect person to talk to about this as well, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1786.4s)]
*  which I was very excited to talk to you about this as well. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1789.44s)]
*  But I'm obviously, I'm a leftist. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1793.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1795.92s)]
*  Oh, I thought this wall would be shorter. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1796.64s)]
*  I thought this wall would be shorter. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1799.28s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1800.4s)]
*  Crazy much. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1800.88s)]
*  And you know, being a socialist of any variety, or anti-deafness of any variety, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1803.52s)]
*  or even a social democrat in America is quite difficult. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1809.92s)]
*  There's not really a lot of political representation. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1813.52s)]
*  No, you got the democrat party and that's it, right? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1817.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and they are notoriously anti, even if social democratic. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1819.44s)]
*  Although, I was listening to a couple of things, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1825.2s)]
*  because I only knew you from that Aaron Bostani interview? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1827.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, okay. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1832.8s)]
*  Hey guys. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1833.52s)]
*  Oh, there's Jeff. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1834.0s)]
*  Hey, nice to meet you. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1834.8s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1835.8400000000001s)]
*  Hello. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1836.64s)]
*  Romeo, hi, Marsh. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1837.1200000000001s)]
*  Marsh, okay. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1839.68s)]
*  No, what was I saying? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1842.32s)]
*  I only knew you from the Aaron Bostani interview. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1843.92s)]
*  I had to go back and look at a bunch of stuff. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1846.0s)]
*  And one of the things I found interesting was just that [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1849.8400000000001s)]
*  the kind of the politics of America crowd, the kind of Kamala Harris people, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1851.92s)]
*  they all want a million of you. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1856.24s)]
*  Except... [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1859.04s)]
*  But not with the politics. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1860.0s)]
*  But not with the politics. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1861.04s)]
*  So they're so far removed. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1862.88s)]
*  I think in America we're so far removed, both historically, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1866.16s)]
*  from any sort of like materialist perspective, but also like [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1871.3600000000001s)]
*  the understanding that politics is about distribution of resources, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1876.5600000000002s)]
*  that like they think everything revolves around optics. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1880.5600000000002s)]
*  So they see a guy like myself and they go, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1883.6000000000001s)]
*  oh, he has a way of appealing to America's like male youth [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1885.92s)]
*  in a way that like we've completely lost. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1889.44s)]
*  What's that about? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1892.0800000000002s)]
*  Not realizing that sure, aesthetics do play a role in this, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1893.44s)]
*  but a big part of I think my popularity comes from [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1896.96s)]
*  the reality that it's not exactly a perspective that is widely shared [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1901.28s)]
*  in mainstream resources or in regular American political consciousness in general. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1907.3600000000001s)]
*  Despite the fact that I think many people, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1914.64s)]
*  including the Potsdamerica audience, is super receptive to the things I talk about. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1917.52s)]
*  They're just... [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1922.64s)]
*  They've just never encountered it unless it's like through a totally reactionary [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1923.52s)]
*  and incredibly anti-anti-capitalist sensibility. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1928.48s)]
*  It's always seen from a negative framework. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1934.88s)]
*  Anyway, I think that's what it is. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1938.96s)]
*  Are we late? We're late, aren't we? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1940.4s)]
*  No, we're fine. We're fine. We're fine. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1941.52s)]
*  They're not that strict about this. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1943.28s)]
*  Surprising. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1945.2s)]
*  Let's walk that way, right? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1946.24s)]
*  It's been a while, actually. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1950.16s)]
*  How are you? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1951.84s)]
*  Pretty good. By the way, I'm Jeffrey. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1952.8s)]
*  Hey, everybody. Hi, Chad. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1954.4s)]
*  So, Romeo here used to be my student. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1956.24s)]
*  Now he is about to get a PhD. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1959.92s)]
*  So, if any of you are studying abroad in Tokyo in the near future, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1964.72s)]
*  you might be able to take a class that Romeo or I teach about Japanese politics. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1968.72s)]
*  Nice. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1973.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1974.24s)]
*  Are you plugging us? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1974.5600000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1975.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1976.16s)]
*  Wait, that's cool, though. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1976.64s)]
*  So... [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1980.8s)]
*  Any questions, by the way, Adam? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1982.0s)]
*  What are some basic views and don'ts? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1984.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1987.12s)]
*  Because we're unfamiliar. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1987.36s)]
*  Because you're... [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1989.28s)]
*  I can imagine after the election, after the American election, right? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1990.08s)]
*  What's on your mind is probably economic populism for the left, right? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1993.52s)]
*  If you're going to ask them anything... [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1998.16s)]
*  I'm just saying the term populism is still a bad word here. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=1999.52s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2003.6s)]
*  So, if you ask a question about what do you think about populism, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2007.68s)]
*  you're going to see it as kind of the right-wing or like the kind of like fake news reactionary or [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2012.08s)]
*  kind of like conspiracy theory left-wing kind of thing. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2017.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2020.96s)]
*  So, that's one thing I had on my mind. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2021.44s)]
*  Other than that, they're pretty chill, honestly. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2024.32s)]
*  Once you're in, once you have like an in, they're quite chill. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2027.04s)]
*  They're pretty normal people, honestly. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2030.96s)]
*  This is sick, dude. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2032.64s)]
*  Go train crossing, actually. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2033.52s)]
*  How dope. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2038.72s)]
*  They're very tame. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2039.76s)]
*  No, I understand that. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2041.28s)]
*  I know a little bit about their background, a little bit about their history. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2043.28s)]
*  Classic sectarian infighting, like inside the party. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2047.44s)]
*  Yeah, all those people who did all the terrorism and stuff, they don't count them as real communists. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2051.44s)]
*  In 55. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2057.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2058.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2059.28s)]
*  Yes, they're, well, they are revisionists. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2060.16s)]
*  They're all the same, reformist revisionists. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2062.64s)]
*  They're reformist revisionists, understandably. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2065.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2068.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think you can operate, like, corollary in a country that America wrote the constitution of, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2070.3199999999997s)]
*  if you weren't. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2075.7599999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2077.92s)]
*  Although one of the things they want to protect the most is that constitution right now. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2078.72s)]
*  They love the constitution. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2082.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2084.0s)]
*  That's, again, fascinating. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2085.2799999999997s)]
*  And I want to hear more about that. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2086.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2088.3199999999997s)]
*  So, the other thing is that like- [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2089.2799999999997s)]
*  Because they're also anti-occupation, right? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2090.4s)]
*  Of course, yeah, they were. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2092.7999999999997s)]
*  But in the beginning, they thought that the occupation was going to be a liberating force. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2093.84s)]
*  So, first they were very pro-occupation. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2098.56s)]
*  MacArthur did, like, release them from jail. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2100.48s)]
*  But MacArthur was a, you know, the general who was in charge. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2103.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm- [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2106.4s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2107.2000000000003s)]
*  So, I'm just saying for the listeners- [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2107.76s)]
*  You're right, you're right. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2109.36s)]
*  My bad. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2109.92s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2110.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2110.6400000000003s)]
*  The guy who was in charge of the occupation, they weren't the allies, they were the Americans, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2111.6000000000004s)]
*  ultimately. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2116.0s)]
*  And so, in the beginning, they thought they would liberate us. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2116.8s)]
*  And maybe they might even get rid of the Emperor, right? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2121.04s)]
*  Because they're American. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2123.84s)]
*  They're not for this whole thing. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2125.12s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah, that was seemingly the bridge that the Americans wouldn't cross in terms of [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2126.56s)]
*  why they- at least in America, the way it's thought is that that's the reason why we had to drop the [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2133.84s)]
*  atom bombs. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2137.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's also Douglas MacArthur, we would know this better, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2139.04s)]
*  but it's MacArthur's own idea, right? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2142.24s)]
*  Yeah, MacArthur thought it would be so cool to have the Emperor as, like, his little buddy, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2144.88s)]
*  supporting him and take photos with him and be the Shogun, basically. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2150.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2155.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, like the show. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2155.68s)]
*  Yeah, he was the last Samurai. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2156.24s)]
*  The Emperor appoints the Shogun to rule Japan, and that's what MacArthur wanted to be, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2157.68s)]
*  and he wanted to run for president. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2163.12s)]
*  So, you're saying MacArthur- oh yeah, oh, I know. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2163.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's right here. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2166.16s)]
*  So, you're saying that MacArthur is the OG weeb. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2166.72s)]
*  No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2170.7999999999997s)]
*  He actually had contempt for their culture. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2172.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2175.36s)]
*  But here's a big copy of their newspaper, the red flag on the wall here. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2176.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2182.2400000000002s)]
*  Of course, green-haired communists. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2183.04s)]
*  I think that might just be the print. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2184.96s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2187.76s)]
*  But yeah, their newspaper is very famous for exposing scandals. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2190.6400000000003s)]
*  Are these the famous party members, or are they just- [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2193.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's Ichiro right there. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2196.2400000000002s)]
*  I think they cover general news, and then they also have, like, right here, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2197.6s)]
*  here's a poster with the secretary general speaking. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2202.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2205.04s)]
*  It's, I think, Romeo wanted me to check on his dude. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2205.68s)]
*  But it says, we want to hear your voice about political problems. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2209.52s)]
*  But their newspaper is amazing at uncovering scandals from the conservative government, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2214.7999999999997s)]
*  because they don't have any sponsors. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2220.72s)]
*  Only their members pay for the paper. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2222.88s)]
*  So, they don't need to worry about pissing off any kind of powerful person. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2224.72s)]
*  They can just go and investigate and unveil, like, all kinds of corruption and stuff. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2230.3999999999996s)]
*  And that's probably the biggest thing that the Communist Party does in Japan. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2234.24s)]
*  And elections, they don't do so great. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2237.6s)]
*  And Romeo will explain. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2240.4799999999996s)]
*  But the Communist Party will give you a good account of, you know, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2241.8399999999997s)]
*  the positives from their view today, I'm sure. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  Hey, you know, if you're a political party, you spin it the way it works for you, right? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2247.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not that they're lying or anything. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2252.0s)]
*  It's just, you know, you've got to be protective of your identity. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2253.4399999999996s)]
*  They might be lying. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2256.4799999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2257.4399999999996s)]
*  Something, something. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2258.0s)]
*  I'm not a communist, so I'm not going to sin for them. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2258.72s)]
*  But I'm not sinning. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2262.08s)]
*  I'm just saying, like, being the oldest political party in Japan, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2262.96s)]
*  historically kind of repressed by the government. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2267.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2271.04s)]
*  You're going to be protective about certain things. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2271.68s)]
*  You're going to spin things in a certain way, like anyone else. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2273.3599999999997s)]
*  So how much would you say this is a correct assessment? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2275.8399999999997s)]
*  After initial electoral success in the aftermath of the World War II government, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2279.92s)]
*  that's when the political repression came. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2284.08s)]
*  And that might have even been a part of, like, the American forces and their attitude, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2286.08s)]
*  not really appreciating that there was a popular sentiment of any kind of socialist politics [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2294.16s)]
*  happening in a country that they had, that they saw as a tremendous strategic importance. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2299.68s)]
*  You know more about the Red Berets. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2306.24s)]
*  Oh, well, I mean, the Congress was under the Republicans at the time. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2308.0s)]
*  And, you know, Truman was president. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2311.52s)]
*  So they were really angry that our tax money was being spent to prop up Reds in Japan. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2313.12s)]
*  So they wanted the government in Japan, the occupation government, to crack down on them. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2319.2s)]
*  Romeo, is everything okay? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2324.88s)]
*  Yeah, just looking for it. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2325.92s)]
*  For the guy? Okay. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2327.3599999999997s)]
*  But yeah, they wanted to... [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2328.48s)]
*  Is that a copy, sir? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2329.2799999999997s)]
*  Uh, I think it is. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2330.08s)]
*  I saw them twice. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2332.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2333.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they show up around here. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2334.96s)]
*  But they're just taking your photos. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2336.4s)]
*  Although you shouldn't wear such a flashy shirt, man. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2337.52s)]
*  You're going to be on their list now. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2340.0s)]
*  Wait, no, wait, don't say that. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2341.52s)]
*  Wait, what? What are you... [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2342.96s)]
*  No, no, wait, am I actually... [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2344.16s)]
*  Errorless. Um, no, I'm just joking. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2345.36s)]
*  Oh, Jesus, don't joke to him like that. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2347.7599999999998s)]
*  Don't joke with him like that. He loves Japan. He should come back. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2349.52s)]
*  You better get on the next flight out of here. No more nine days, okay? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2352.4s)]
*  Um, but anyway, um, so, uh, yeah, so the U.S. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2355.44s)]
*  occupation authorities wanted to reduce the influence of communism as much as possible [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2360.16s)]
*  because the Cold War was beginning. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2364.56s)]
*  So the Americans would do things like deny paper rations to the communist newspapers. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2366.64s)]
*  They would deny the right of certain communists to run for office. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2372.0s)]
*  But this was also at a time when the communists were resisting [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2375.76s)]
*  violently through protests to the Americans. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2380.4s)]
*  And their labor unions would sometimes have violent clashes with police. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2383.6s)]
*  So the Americans were trying to be like, everybody can have a labor union. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2386.88s)]
*  But then, oh, oops, there's communist unions now. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2391.68s)]
*  Um, let's crack down on that. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2393.92s)]
*  It is illegal to still to this day in the United States of America for [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2396.48s)]
*  out and about communists to head a labor union. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2401.52s)]
*  So yeah, and I think pretty much all of the unions in Japan today are no longer communist. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2403.6s)]
*  They would be pressured into firing their leaders and the communist party leadership. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2410.16s)]
*  Some of them had to flee the country because they were just banned from running. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2415.68s)]
*  The Americans could arbitrarily decide who could get to run and who not. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2420.16s)]
*  So eventually, though, after they gave up on violence. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2424.5600000000004s)]
*  Hey, don't give a lecture. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2427.84s)]
*  Let's let's walk and die. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2429.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm waiting for you. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2430.1600000000003s)]
*  No, no, please. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2431.2000000000003s)]
*  After they gave up on violence in the 1950s, they sort of started making a comeback electorally. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2432.8s)]
*  Oh, here's some nice posters. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2438.88s)]
*  No expansion of military spending or raising taxes. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2440.88s)]
*  Use diplomacy of like speaking to other countries, not pressuring them and then protect peace. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2446.1600000000003s)]
*  This one is, you know, saying like you don't want the [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2452.16s)]
*  prices going up or the sales tax going up. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2455.7599999999998s)]
*  They have the best graphic designers, the communists. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2459.12s)]
*  Very cute. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2461.28s)]
*  Very anti-tax. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2464.56s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2466.88s)]
*  So they're [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2467.84s)]
*  Well, there is sales tax, which is a more aggressive tax group. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2469.92s)]
*  There's no, but the biggest is that there's just no talk about taxing the rich. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2474.0s)]
*  That's just not in the conversation. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2477.6s)]
*  That would be populism. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2479.28s)]
*  Jeff likes memorabilia. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2488.0800000000004s)]
*  There's all the stuff you can buy. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2489.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2491.52s)]
*  You can buy the little creepy dolls. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2498.0800000000004s)]
*  A model of the [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2501.6800000000003s)]
*  Is that a pencil sharpener? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2504.4s)]
*  It might be. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2506.32s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2507.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2507.92s)]
*  Oh, do you have like a stamp book? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2509.36s)]
*  You can do a stamp. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2511.36s)]
*  I do not have a stamp. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2512.32s)]
*  Damn. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2513.6000000000004s)]
*  You could have got the party headquarters. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2516.0s)]
*  But like 2013, they started doing these kind of like social media mascots. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2519.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very familiar with their anime. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2523.6800000000003s)]

*  you're dropping this building, they... [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2790.7200000000003s)]
*  When they find that... [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2795.04s)]
*  They take photos? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2796.88s)]
*  Yeah, photos or especially the left-wing people get excited. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2798.2400000000002s)]
*  Red flag in the Tokyo center building. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2805.92s)]
*  So what's the... [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2809.92s)]
*  What's the creed we see on the flag? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2815.92s)]
*  A fan gave it to us. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2818.32s)]
*  The creed? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2819.2000000000003s)]
*  It's, of course, color is red. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2821.28s)]
*  It's maybe the international common color, but it's a [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2825.28s)]
*  kind of a progress and a militant character of our party. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2832.4s)]
*  Well, we have some symbols. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2843.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2847.76s)]
*  What are the symbols? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2848.08s)]
*  Symbols. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2850.0s)]
*  This is, of course, rice. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2851.6800000000003s)]
*  And this is the... [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2854.48s)]
*  Card. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2856.0s)]
*  Card. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2857.12s)]
*  So this is the union of peasants and workers, traditionally. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2858.96s)]
*  And those four flags are... [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2865.76s)]
*  Well, I don't remember the sequences, but the independence, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2869.92s)]
*  democracy, and international solidarity, and also a strong party organization. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2880.88s)]
*  So we call the four flags of the party. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2889.28s)]
*  And this is the explanation of the history of the building, the center building. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2895.6s)]
*  And, you know, our party was outlawed existence before the war, 80 years ago. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2902.7999999999997s)]
*  But after the war, after the defeat of the imperial system regime, we started openly [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2913.36s)]
*  active in the society. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2925.7599999999998s)]
*  And one of the supporters gave us this building. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2928.16s)]
*  This was the kind of vocational school and combined with some factories. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2934.56s)]
*  This was the beginning of our building. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2942.8799999999997s)]
*  Before that, we did not have any permanent office because we were chased by the regime [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2948.16s)]
*  or police and smashed by. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2955.68s)]
*  So it's the new beginning after the war. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2959.52s)]
*  And so gradually we managed to rebuild and rebuild and rebuild. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2963.3599999999997s)]
*  And those pictures are the pictures of my age. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  I joined the party during my student times. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2981.7599999999998s)]
*  And at that time, this kind of looks like a little bit complicated and, you know, plus, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2988.48s)]
*  plus, plus, you know. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2995.68s)]
*  And after the great earthquake in the western part of Japan, 1995, we analyzed this building [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=2997.3599999999997s)]
*  and we were told that, oh, you are in danger when that kind of magnitude will occur. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3008.64s)]
*  So we decided to rebuild the new building. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3016.08s)]
*  But in order to do that, you know, we have to collect, I mean, we need money, huge money. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3022.0s)]
*  We called the supporters and members, donate for the, you know, we build the new one. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3030.0s)]
*  And we did not borrow any one cent, no, nothing from the banks. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3041.6s)]
*  Because if we borrow, you know, we have to pay back the loan, you know. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3050.32s)]
*  And interest, yeah. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3054.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's really ridiculous. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3055.36s)]
*  So in terms of active membership, I've read that it's, some people have said it's around 500,000. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3059.04s)]
*  But some estimates put it around 250,000. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3067.52s)]
*  250,000, around. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3072.08s)]
*  Okay, 250,000. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3074.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3076.24s)]
*  And more maybe 20 years ago. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3077.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3080.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3082.0s)]
*  So that's actually kind of what I want to talk to you about as well. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3083.84s)]
*  Is there, what do you think is the reason for membership having over the course of the past two decades? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3086.24s)]
*  We have somehow managed to maintain the overall membership numbers. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3095.4399999999996s)]
*  But the, our weakest point is the ages. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3102.8799999999997s)]
*  The 80s. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3111.2s)]
*  It's like the, you know, upside down or pyramid, you know. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3112.56s)]
*  The main strata of the members are, well, over 60s, you know, 60s, 70s. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3117.04s)]
*  Or like 70s, 80s are the baby boomers. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3126.0s)]
*  Or those, many students or young people joined the party during the 1960s or 1970s. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3130.0s)]
*  Those are the main strata. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3140.72s)]
*  So we have to expand the, you know, young or those people in the 30s or 40s, you know. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3143.92s)]
*  So we are now gradually regaining the membership in that ages. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3153.28s)]
*  But still we are struggling to, you know, increase those numbers in that ages. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3158.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3166.2400000000002s)]
*  In terms of Japanese politics, what are, like, what does youth politics look like in Japan? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3167.36s)]
*  Is there any sort of resurgence in left-wing mobilization in Japan? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3175.92s)]
*  Or if there is one even, what is it structured around? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3182.2400000000002s)]
*  Is it more decentralized? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3187.04s)]
*  Or is it through party membership? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3188.64s)]
*  Well, I might say we see these last several years, especially after the, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3192.8s)]
*  we see the new trend of activism among the youth and students. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3207.44s)]
*  Especially students are struggling to earn money for their high tuition fees. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3217.04s)]
*  That's what I wanted to ask about as well. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3227.68s)]
*  Like, what are some of the most common issues that the youth of Japan are facing right now? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3229.2s)]
*  For students, number one is the high tuition fees. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3234.96s)]
*  And well, we do not have enough scholarship system. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3239.28s)]
*  And so students usually earn money by the part-time jobs or, you know, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3248.8s)]
*  of course parents support them. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3255.44s)]
*  So it's a huge burden for students and parents. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3258.1600000000003s)]
*  And but after the outbreak of the pandemic, they lost the place of work, you know, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3263.12s)]
*  in the pubs or the shops, you know. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3271.6800000000003s)]
*  They're virtually closed and they face the stop of revenue for the daily lives, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3275.92s)]
*  not only for the tuition fees. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3284.96s)]
*  So at that time, our Democratic Youth League of Japan, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3287.6s)]
*  it is well known formally before the war, it's a communist youth league of Japan. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3292.4s)]
*  That Democratic Youth League started to special food bank for students. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3299.8399999999997s)]
*  They collect those, you know, foods or other goods from our supporters or people, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3307.04s)]
*  then distribute to the students in front of the universities or colleges. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3315.36s)]
*  And then they had new contacts and some of the students got interested in that activities [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3320.8s)]
*  and the existence of that, you know, youth organization. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3331.52s)]
*  Also at that time, people, not only students, but, you know, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3337.52s)]
*  started to think something wrong, you know, in this society, especially under the pandemic. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3342.0s)]
*  So we attract those students to come to the, you know, meetings and maybe seminar. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3350.64s)]
*  Must be hard to get students to join the party, right? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3361.12s)]
*  Well, because I'm thinking people don't like, I mean, it's just like nowadays, you know, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3365.92s)]
*  people don't like to join political parties, regardless of like, the political. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3372.0s)]
*  Well, in one aspect, it is true. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3379.92s)]
*  Not only the political parties, but the, you know, in some organizations, you know, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3385.04s)]
*  and also, yeah, exactly. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3392.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3394.88s)]
*  Japan is the society of maybe strong conformism, you know, and well, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3396.1s)]
*  conformism is a neutral word, but it is virtually a pressure from the, you know, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3402.58s)]
*  you know, government or mass media. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3408.1s)]
*  But on the other hand, kids, I mean, youngsters do not have, you know, enough image or do not have [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3411.54s)]
*  bad images of the communist party. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3426.34s)]
*  I mean, they do not nothing. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3430.02s)]
*  So no image whatsoever. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3434.82s)]
*  According to research, if you poll, maybe until like, maybe starting like 10 years ago, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3438.82s)]
*  you poll young children, 18 year olds, 19 year olds about what do you think the [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3444.34s)]
*  communist party is about, they say they're conservative. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3450.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3453.1400000000003s)]
*  I have heard that from Westerners as well. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3453.86s)]
*  That the Japanese communist party is somewhat conservative, but is that [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3456.98s)]
*  conservative in terms of social? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3461.1400000000003s)]
*  No, it's the, it's the imagery. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3462.9s)]
*  It's pretty much the idea of the communist party being old and being around for a long time, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3464.1800000000003s)]
*  being protective of like the constitution kind of has given some younger voters the idea that it's [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3469.2200000000003s)]
*  that it's conservative, that this is what it means to be conservative. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3476.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3479.78s)]
*  So is there an another place that we can, are we going to continue by the way? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3481.0s)]
*  Because we keep doing that and I'll keep asking questions. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3485.32s)]
*  So I have, I've seen that as well. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3490.44s)]
*  What, what is, what are some of the defining characteristics of the modern Japanese [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3492.6800000000003s)]
*  communist party? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3496.92s)]
*  Like, what would you say your, your ideology or leading are in your advocacy? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3498.2000000000003s)]
*  Advocacy. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3505.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3508.44s)]
*  Of course we are the Japanese communist party. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3511.48s)]
*  We are struggling for the new future, but the, at this moment our main focus is the [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3515.7200000000003s)]
*  revolution of democratic one and for the independent, real independence. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3525.48s)]
*  That is the independence from the US Japan military alliances. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3531.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3538.2s)]
*  That is number one. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3538.7s)]
*  And the second one is the free from big cooperation first politics. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3540.36s)]
*  So these two major problems are the tasks we have to tackle. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3550.04s)]
*  And, you know, abandoned the US Japan military alliance is understandable maybe. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3559.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3568.04s)]
*  We have the many US military bases, not only in rural area, but in central Japan too. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3568.76s)]
*  In Tokyo. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3577.88s)]
*  We were right near one, the other day when we went to the, to the Kendo Bushido place. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3578.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3586.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3588.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3589.02s)]
*  Bushido, right? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3589.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3590.2s)]
*  We have the air base and the naval base over there. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3591.8s)]
*  Apparently they cause a lot of problems. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3596.2s)]
*  They get drunk, they fight, sexual assaults, rapes, car crashes. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3598.2s)]
*  The American, the American government recently extracted a American service member who fell [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3604.7599999999998s)]
*  asleep at the wheel in Okinawa, if I'm not mistaken, and drove over a Japanese family. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3612.12s)]
*  Japanese government apprehended him, prosecuted him criminally. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3616.52s)]
*  He was in jail. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3619.24s)]
*  And then the American government forced the Japanese government's hand to, to free him [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3620.52s)]
*  essentially and bring him back to the United States of America. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3626.36s)]
*  That's right. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3628.68s)]
*  That's the always, you know, it's a business as usual. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3630.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3634.44s)]
*  So that kind of stuff, does that not instill some kind of anger in, in, uh, Japanese, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3635.26s)]
*  in the Japanese population in general? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3643.82s)]
*  In general? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3645.82s)]
*  Well, in general, um, but the, um... [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3646.94s)]
*  But there's no expression of it. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3650.06s)]
*  There's an expression, but especially in Okinawa, the bad region, there the, um, well, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3652.7000000000003s)]
*  it's a kind of continuation of the colonial rule by the military. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3662.06s)]
*  So their anger, not only against the U.S. military bases, but at the same time, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3669.58s)]
*  I think the most big, biggest anger is the, against the Japanese government. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3676.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, they are too much subordinate to the U.S., you know, those system. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3683.58s)]
*  So, um, we are, um, well, persuading, well, talking to people about that kind of unfair [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3690.94s)]
*  relationship between the two countries. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3703.18s)]
*  And we have to get out of that regime to change the more equal state and get a, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3705.9s)]
*  get rid of all bases. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3715.5s)]
*  But at the same time, the hard thing is that the, you know, people are afraid of China or Russia, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3717.66s)]
*  those, and the argument is that the, you know, we have to have some kind of... [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3725.74s)]
*  Protection. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3732.8599999999997s)]
*  Protection or so-called deterrence, you know. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3733.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3736.14s)]
*  Ukraine really had a big effect on young people's ideas of what security is like. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3737.18s)]
*  I mean, we teach a lot of young people, right, and we get a lot of, like, opinion essays. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3743.18s)]
*  And it's definitely, definitely the feeling, at least from my end of the... [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3747.34s)]
*  Since Ukraine war happened, it's, everybody talks about the fear of, like, other countries, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3750.5400000000004s)]
*  militaries, and their homeworks and stuff. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3757.02s)]
*  It's, it's kind of rocketed. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3759.26s)]
*  So the Japanese government, those two, you know, make the military budget, you know, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3761.6600000000003s)]
*  by each day. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3770.5400000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3771.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3772.0600000000004s)]
*  It's really massive buildup. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3772.46s)]
*  So... [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3774.3s)]
*  It's accelerated from what I understand. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3774.7s)]
*  It was discussed with Xi Jinping as well in America when he visited in San Francisco. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3776.2999999999997s)]
*  One of the big points of contention there was the missile systems in Japan [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3781.4199999999996s)]
*  and the escalation of the Japanese self-defense. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3787.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3789.58s)]
*  And it seems as though the industrial outfit is moving in that direction as well, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3791.2599999999998s)]
*  specifically to be used, I guess, as a bulwark against China. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3798.54s)]
*  Um, is there... [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3802.86s)]
*  You can choose not to answer this, but what is the overall public sentiment against China in Japan [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3806.0600000000004s)]
*  and the Chinese government? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3812.94s)]
*  And also, what is the party's attitude towards that as well? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3814.46s)]
*  Well, the sentiment of the Japanese public is mainly really, you know, bad, you know. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3817.82s)]
*  Image is bad. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3826.1400000000003s)]
*  Even with all the tourism? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3827.1800000000003s)]
*  Especially. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3829.26s)]
*  Especially with all the tourism. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3829.9s)]
*  Especially with all the tourism. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3830.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3831.58s)]
*  Well, nothing special, but... [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3832.46s)]
*  The media makes it. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3836.62s)]
*  The media has a spin on it. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3837.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3839.02s)]
*  Mainly the actions or coercive actions near the islands of Japan in the southern part [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3839.8199999999997s)]
*  or the, you know, oppression of democracy or human rights issues in, you know, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3851.98s)]
*  Hong Kong or Xinjiang Weigu. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3860.38s)]
*  So it is really understandable, you know, those images. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3863.34s)]
*  And we too publicly criticize the Chinese government and China's party. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3867.1800000000003s)]
*  It is not the... [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3875.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, they too support for the human rights, you know, international convention. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3877.8199999999997s)]
*  But what they are doing is totally different. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3883.3399999999997s)]
*  America does too. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3889.18s)]
*  Two, two. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3890.54s)]
*  I mean, so our party stands against the military blocs of the U.S. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3893.2599999999998s)]
*  But also we stand against China's those behaviors. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3900.46s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3907.42s)]
*  Universal pacifism. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3907.82s)]
*  Universal and also the... [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3909.66s)]
*  It is the spirit of independence and also the spirit of the true commitment to the communism. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3911.66s)]
*  Because the communism itself is an ideology for the freedom, you know. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3923.1s)]
*  Liberation from the oppression or other exploitations. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3928.14s)]
*  But what the China's party is doing is totally different from the theory. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3931.74s)]
*  As China says, the socialism of the Chinese characteristic. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3938.7799999999997s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3943.9s)]
*  You know, it is a strange word. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3944.38s)]
*  So that is our critical point toward China. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3947.1s)]
*  Also we stood firmly against the Soviet invasions, against the Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan or other things. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3951.58s)]
*  But so we are keen to that bad things. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3959.66s)]
*  But at the same time we are the neighbors, you know, with China. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3968.06s)]
*  So we have to solve everything, all problems through the dialogue or negotiations. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3971.1s)]
*  It is not the military to military confrontation. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3978.54s)]
*  It is the way to, you know, maybe ultimately it is a way to war, you know. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3981.98s)]
*  It's really ridiculous. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3989.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3990.94s)]
*  What if China reinstated the common turn? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3992.06s)]
*  Oh. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3995.18s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3997.66s)]
*  I'm saying, who knows? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=3998.7s)]
*  Hypothetically. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4001.02s)]
*  The common turn? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4002.86s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4004.22s)]
*  Actually, last year I was invited to Beijing for the international conference on the theme of the world socialism. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4005.34s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4020.38s)]
*  Well, quite a few overseas participants placed the achievement of the China or Chinese socialist. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4023.1800000000003s)]
*  I didn't say nothing about that. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4033.7400000000002s)]
*  I just, you know. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4036.38s)]
*  Come on. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4037.9s)]
*  I mean high-speed rail is pretty good. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4038.3s)]
*  You guys have it too. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4040.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4041.26s)]
*  Well, so China do not want to make new common turn. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4042.6200000000003s)]
*  They publicly say that. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4050.1400000000003s)]
*  But virtually they of course want to expand their influence. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4051.58s)]
*  Well, but our party is, I mean we do not support the new common turn. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4056.78s)]
*  Now each party has its own right and they are all, you know, independent. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4069.1s)]
*  And the most important thing is that the ideologically we are not the same, you know. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4074.54s)]
*  We have many different, you know, perspectives. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4084.46s)]
*  As I said, the human rights or democracy, we do not have the common ground maybe. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4087.9s)]
*  Some, but they, you know, call themselves as communist party, but I don't know. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4096.86s)]
*  It's real communism or not. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4106.54s)]
*  But they are the ruling party of China. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4108.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4112.62s)]
*  And we are the party now in the opposition, but we are aiming for the going to the new government. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4113.34s)]
*  So we have to cope with China or Russia or of course even North Korea. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4121.34s)]
*  So that's our point. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4130.7s)]
*  Well, in the world we have to do at most diplomatically. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4134.860000000001s)]
*  That's the point. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4140.780000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4141.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's also, I add that it is the point of our constitution. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4142.719999999999s)]
*  Japanese constitution denounced the war, like a war. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4150.0s)]
*  And we do not, officially do not have military, but now we have. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4154.48s)]
*  So as constitution, we act in accordance with the constitution. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4160.799999999999s)]
*  We have to pursue the diplomatic way to solve the problems. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4167.759999999999s)]
*  What do you think about Donald Trump? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4172.08s)]
*  Oh, super. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4174.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4180.32s)]
*  What's the overall attitude about Donald Trump in Japan in your estimations? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4183.12s)]
*  I don't know for sure, but at least our party on the inauguration day, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4188.5599999999995s)]
*  published the statement, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4196.639999999999s)]
*  which well enough critical to the Mr. Trump, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4199.04s)]
*  because of his expanding territories or the withdrawal from the WHO or Paris agreement. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4206.16s)]
*  It's really, well, it's ridiculous. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4214.72s)]
*  Not good. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4218.0s)]
*  Not good. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4219.04s)]
*  And also a kind of the way of the isolation of the country, I think. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4219.6s)]
*  And mainstream war of the world is more, I mean, quite different from that. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4228.8s)]
*  And the cooperation or that kind of thing. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4238.0s)]
*  So Mr. Trump's action remarks are really big concern for us too. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4242.72s)]
*  And the people in Japan. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4253.360000000001s)]

*  He's a big fan. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4257.360000000001s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4258.64s)]
*  Mr. Abe is the number one enemy of us. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4260.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4263.360000000001s)]
*  Well, was the number one enemy. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4264.56s)]

*  That's what I've heard. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4272.88s)]

*  It's nine, 12 building. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4302.0s)]
*  Can we talk to a journalist that wouldn't mind if they speak English? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4306.8s)]
*  Some. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4313.92s)]

*  You're great. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4324.8s)]

*  I invited a friend to come who's an organizer here. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4343.5s)]
*  But she was somewhat noncommittal and I don't think she showed up. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4348.8s)]
*  So yeah, I was just checking if she, if he heard anything. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4351.92s)]

*  people and of course the female activists, you know, support our party. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4667.96s)]
*  It's not a good trend. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4679.96s)]
*  Are trans issues a big part of Japanese politics? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4685.96s)]
*  Well, not like in your country, but... [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4695.96s)]
*  We're becoming fewer, I think. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4709.96s)]
*  Do you feel like American politics influences Japanese politics as well? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4713.56s)]
*  Not in terms of, like obviously American foreign policy has a major role in Japanese politics [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4718.56s)]
*  in general, but would you say that even domestic politics in America, things that we talk about [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4725.56s)]
*  like in terms of social issues, ends up becoming a public conversation here in Japan as well? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4731.96s)]
*  Uh oh. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4740.96s)]
*  We're locked out. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4742.96s)]
*  We're stuck on the Japanese Communist Party's roof. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4743.96s)]
*  We're gonna get an American helicopter. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4747.96s)]
*  We're gonna spend the next six hours on this roof. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4750.96s)]
*  Did DEI do this? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4755.96s)]
*  They need some white people here. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4759.96s)]
*  By the way, these are the post-Colons. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4761.96s)]
*  I think these are great. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4763.96s)]
*  So is there still a big focus on great unionism within the party as well or has the, because [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4768.96s)]
*  of the previous political repression, would you say that the unions are no longer affiliated [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4774.96s)]
*  with any political party? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4780.96s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4781.96s)]
*  I mean, we put big emphasis on the trade union movement and also the movement for the agriculture workers. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4783.96s)]
*  I think in this price hike, high price society, trade union has a big role and they are preparing [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4796.96s)]
*  for the so-called spring struggle in Japan. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4811.96s)]
*  There's gonna be general action? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4816.96s)]
*  Yeah, general action. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4818.96s)]
*  And in spring, trade unions, I mean Japan, they, well, together put the demands to the [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4820.96s)]
*  government, not government, to the corporation companies. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4830.96s)]
*  And so we have two major national trade unions. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4833.96s)]
*  One is the really big, but kind of cop with the, you know, capitalists. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4839.96s)]
*  Lingo. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4848.96s)]
*  Lingo, and they are very anti, well, their chairman, chairwoman is really anti-communist, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4849.96s)]
*  but... [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4857.96s)]
*  It's not shocking. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4858.96s)]
*  It's out as in America too. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4861.96s)]
*  Well, it's changing a little bit now. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4863.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4865.96s)]
*  And, but the other one, Zendou Ren, called Zendou Ren, is one tenth in size, smaller [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4866.96s)]
*  than the bigger major one. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4876.96s)]
*  And how big are these unions that we're talking about, like numbers wise? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4878.96s)]
*  How many, if you go off the top of your head? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4881.96s)]
*  Well, he will... [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4885.96s)]
*  No, don't, it's actually quite complicated, right? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4886.96s)]
*  Because there's so many different unions and they sometimes kind of break off and so on, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4888.96s)]
*  right? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4894.96s)]
*  Well, maybe, let's say, 10 million and maybe several millions like that, you know, compelling. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4895.96s)]
*  But the thing is that the smaller one, national one, is really militant and they are preparing [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4903.96s)]
*  for the strikes and gaining their membership in the, especially in the teachers' unions. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4910.96s)]
*  And they have, they contacted with the, it's Chamfein. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4920.96s)]
*  Oh, Chamfein? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4927.96s)]
*  Chamfein last year. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4928.96s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4929.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4930.96s)]
*  I love Chamfein, he's incredible. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4931.96s)]
*  Chamfein mentioned. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4934.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4937.96s)]
*  And... [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4938.96s)]
*  Chamfein? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4939.96s)]
*  Chamfein? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4940.96s)]
*  Which? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4941.96s)]
*  Wait, are you talking about Chamfein, the American labor union leader? [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4942.96s)]
*  Or are you talking about Chamfein the Irish? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4945.96s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4947.96s)]
*  Chamfein. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4948.96s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4949.96s)]
*  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4950.96s)]
*  I heard Chamfein. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4951.96s)]
*  Not the Irish. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4952.96s)]
*  Not the Irish. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4953.96s)]
*  But that wouldn't be that crazy. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4954.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4956.96s)]
*  Anyway, one year ago. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4957.96s)]
*  He sent the really good Milton message to our trade union. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4959.96s)]
*  It says here that labor union participation in Japan is at 16.3% as of 2023. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4966.96s)]
*  And I checked, Zerodan is 1.2 million. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4973.96s)]
*  And the total union membership is at 10 million, 10.2 million. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4977.96s)]
*  So it's very low in terms of, I mean, but it's expected. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4982.96s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4986.96s)]
*  So American influence, I would say, probably plays a role in that. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4987.96s)]
*  Maybe, but not only the American influence, but the, well, overall, but neoliberalism. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4990.96s)]
*  American backed corporate neoliberal attitudes. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=4997.96s)]
*  But we have, well, we are now gaining kind of momentum to push back. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5001.96s)]
*  And especially, as I said, among students or the young workers also, too. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5009.96s)]
*  So, and party itself, you know, conveyor activity to consult, well, receive any, you know, things. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5017.96s)]
*  People are having troubles. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5034.96s)]
*  But it's all very practical in nature. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5037.96s)]
*  So if you have any, you know, something wrong or difficulties, you know, come to us. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5040.96s)]
*  In your livelihood. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5046.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5047.96s)]
*  And also, so this is a little guy, I guess. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5048.96s)]
*  This is a campaign poster four years ago. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5053.96s)]
*  And actually, this poster was made by one of the supporters who are not, who is not a member of the party. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5059.96s)]
*  Can I ask why is it, I always wondered this. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5070.96s)]
*  Why is it a Genbera? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5073.96s)]
*  Why is it not a rose is what I always wonder. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5077.96s)]
*  Because it's the Communist Party, right? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5080.96s)]
*  It's not a rose. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5082.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5084.96s)]
*  I always expect to see if there's a flower, I would expect a rose, not get a better. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5086.96s)]
*  Maybe because it was a supporter. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5091.96s)]
*  I think it's a member. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5093.96s)]
*  Well, at least it is bad. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5095.96s)]
*  It is bad. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5097.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5098.96s)]
*  Close enough. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5099.96s)]
*  Actually, this room was those people who are involved in the, who are in charge of trade unions and other people's movement. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5103.96s)]
*  He is former Youth League chairman. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5119.96s)]

*  What about the left party? [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5735.96s)]
*  What about in America? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5737.96s)]
*  In America, we have what kind of relationship with the Communist Party of USA? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5741.96s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5750.96s)]
*  And we have some kind of ties, I mean the individual ties with the DSA. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5752.96s)]
*  Oh, the DSA. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5763.96s)]
*  I mean, not official relationship, but you know, sometimes members of the DSA come to [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5766.96s)]
*  our office here. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5774.96s)]
*  Actually, by the way, this is the level for the party. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5776.96s)]
*  So, we have to, you know, need those, you know, documents to prepare for. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5781.96s)]
*  Yeah, for dietary, you know, debate or anything. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5792.96s)]
*  Actually, we have more books or materials downstairs. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5800.96s)]
*  So, the students like Romeo-san, time to time come to this place to, you know, see some documents. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5808.96s)]

*  If I have a reason to, yeah. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5847.96s)]
*  Not just out of interest to find something. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5849.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5852.96s)]
*  I'll just stick around for the next guy. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5853.96s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5856.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think, I don't think the State Department is all too worried about JCP activities. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5859.96s)]
*  No. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5866.96s)]
*  Especially not right now. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5871.96s)]
*  Too worried about creating reasonable grounds to invade, maybe not Denmark, but Greenland. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5875.96s)]
*  Sorry, I meant, yeah, I meant liberate. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5887.96s)]
*  I mean liberate Greenland from colonial oppression, of course. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5889.96s)]
*  That's why you got to go in, find some natives, say that these guys are yearning for freedom. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5892.96s)]
*  The Greenland Liberation Movement. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5898.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5901.96s)]
*  That is if the CIA was competent. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5907.96s)]
*  I feel like it's no longer, it's a mere remnant of its former glory. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5909.96s)]
*  Didn't they even want to get rid of the FBI's, like the DC? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5913.96s)]
*  Oh, they were talking about, yeah, they were talking about deleting the DC headquarters from the FBI. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5920.96s)]
*  That's just political posture. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5924.96s)]
*  They're firing a bunch of people who are involved in the arresting January 6th people. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5925.96s)]
*  So basically all the veteran leaders are losing their jobs. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5930.96s)]
*  Which ironically, Trump hired. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5934.96s)]
*  Of course. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5936.96s)]
*  Like Trump appointed. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5937.96s)]
*  Trump fired Jim Comey and then appointed the FBI director that oversaw the prosecution of January 6th, the political hostages. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5938.96s)]
*  They weren't loyal, yeah. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5947.96s)]
*  The political hostages of January 6th. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5949.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not keeping up right now with politics in America, but yeah, it sounds like. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5952.96s)]
*  Don't worry, it's keeping up with you. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5958.96s)]
*  It sounds like hell. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5959.96s)]
*  This is the Aka-Hata. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5963.96s)]
*  Aka-Hata is the name of the picture. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5967.96s)]
*  Akatsuki is a dome. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5971.96s)]
*  The name of the printing office. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5974.96s)]
*  Akatsuki? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5978.96s)]
*  Akatsuki. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5979.96s)]
*  Oh, like in Naruto. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5980.96s)]
*  It's, yeah, it's, what is it, Twilight? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5982.96s)]
*  Like setting sun? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5986.96s)]
*  No, no, it's a dome. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5987.96s)]
*  Dome, it's the opposite. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5988.96s)]
*  Sunrise, yeah. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5989.96s)]
*  So it probably has an origin character. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5990.96s)]
*  So the printing in Tokyo is owned by the company. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5993.96s)]
*  They go to the store and print it. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=5997.96s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6047.96s)]
*  So now we're in the printing press of the Japanese Communist Party. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6048.96s)]
*  Country is government. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6058.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6060.96s)]
*  The Japanese government is conservative. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6061.96s)]
*  The recent ones. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6063.96s)]
*  These are recent ones. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6066.96s)]
*  This is the newspaper that we publish every day. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6068.96s)]
*  This is the weekly newspaper that we publish once a week. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6072.96s)]
*  The weekly newspaper is the newspaper that has the largest number of articles in Japan. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6079.96s)]
*  So they've uncovered a scandal with regional branches of the LDP party involved in very [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6085.96s)]
*  shady fundraising practices where they don't report on their own. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6105.96s)]
*  Like the amount of money they're making from these parties. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6114.96s)]
*  That's what they are reporting on now. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6117.96s)]
*  So the government is starting to, do you say print bonds? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6144.96s)]
*  No, government bonds. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6149.96s)]
*  You're creating bonds to fund military expansion, which is the thing that was kind of against [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6151.96s)]
*  the norm until about three years ago. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6159.96s)]
*  And they're reporting on how it's become increasingly normalized to use shakkin to create debts in [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6162.96s)]
*  order to fund this. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6168.96s)]
*  It's not just political. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6173.96s)]
*  They have all kinds of news. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6178.96s)]
*  Recipes, food. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6179.96s)]

*  Society. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6185.96s)]
*  We cut out for a second so I just want to restart it. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6187.96s)]
*  We just restarted it, sorry. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6203.96s)]
*  So, Chad, I don't know what part you guys missed, but we are now in the offices of the party [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6205.96s)]

*  They were showing us the many different journalistic awards that they've won. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6219.96s)]
*  Oh, since the elevator. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6224.96s)]
*  Since the elevator. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6226.96s)]
*  Damn, I didn't realize it was too late. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6228.96s)]
*  This is the deputy editor in chief and these are the three awards that they had shown us. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6230.96s)]
*  This is the recent scoop where the LDP lost a lot of votes. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6236.96s)]
*  It was a scoop about how the party handles money and how it accounts for money in their [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6243.96s)]
*  books, which showed that they've been kind of like doing some shady practices there. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6250.96s)]
*  And yeah, Aka Hata won an award for this. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6255.96s)]
*  They won an award in 2020 because of Abe Shinzo's certain scandals related to Abe Shinzo at [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6258.96s)]
*  the time. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6265.96s)]
*  And then one more regarding the uncovering of the fact that the Japanese government was [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6266.96s)]
*  against the introduction of a first strike. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6271.96s)]
*  Against Obama getting rid of the first strike policy for nuclear weapons. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6275.96s)]
*  They were actually behind the scenes saying, actually, Obama, we like first strike to protect [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6279.96s)]
*  Japan, so keep those nukes. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6283.96s)]
*  And the JCP through this newspaper uncovered that. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=6286.96s)]

*  Feels like it. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7261.96s)]
*  I'm so hungry. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7262.96s)]
*  I'm not gonna have time to eat though. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7264.96s)]
*  What time do you have to leave? [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7266.96s)]
*  I have to be in the West side at 1.30. I have to stop at a hotel and grab a little camera. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7267.96s)]
*  So I'm gonna have to eat. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7271.96s)]
*  I'm so hungry. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7274.96s)]

*  I'm so hungry. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7289.96s)]
*  I'm so hungry. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7290.96s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7293.96s)]
*  I'm the podcast's chief. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7294.96s)]
*  You used to record a podcast. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7295.96s)]
*  Well, you know, let me know when you need to... [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7300.96s)]
*  No, no, no, he can leave. I'll just man the camera myself. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7303.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7305.96s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7310.96s)]
*  I'm gonna have to find the machine. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7317.96s)]
*  This is the big conference hall. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7318.96s)]
*  Oh, it's the other side. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7334.96s)]
*  That's where we came the other side. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7336.96s)]
*  Just power through it. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7349.96s)]
*  Power through it. Keep going. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7350.96s)]
*  I'm trying to have some communist grub. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7352.96s)]
*  Hopefully Chad could smell what was in there. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7359.96s)]
*  If you're gonna do a sit down thing, I might just prop the camera and dip out. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7368.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7372.96s)]
*  Like, obviously. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7373.96s)]
*  Let's see you guys over here. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7376.96s)]
*  What is the position of authority in a Japanese table? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7382.96s)]
*  That's a seat. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7385.96s)]
*  Any place. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7388.96s)]
*  By the way, I would be... [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7390.96s)]
*  Oh, thank you very much. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7393.96s)]
*  In Japan, there's this thing where if you go... [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7395.96s)]
*  The sitting arrangement is kind of settled, but we're very... [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7397.96s)]
*  By seniority and level of respect. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7401.96s)]
*  So if you sit at the wrong chair at this table, people would be really angry. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7403.96s)]
*  Like older people, they'd be like... [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7408.96s)]
*  Not here. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7409.96s)]
*  Yeah, not here. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7410.96s)]
*  We don't do hierarchy. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7411.96s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7413.96s)]
*  There's leaders. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7414.96s)]
*  They would get really angry. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7416.96s)]
*  Will I need someone to escort me out? [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7417.96s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7419.96s)]
*  I'll ask him. I tried to get in between. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7420.96s)]
*  Come back with tea and then he'll escort you. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7423.96s)]
*  Out of the party premises. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7426.96s)]
*  He'll take you to the room where they make people disappear. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7428.96s)]
*  Maybe get a little like stiff here. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7431.96s)]
*  What? Where? [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7434.96s)]
*  In between you guys. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7435.96s)]
*  Oh. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7437.96s)]
*  The table is just so wide. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7438.96s)]
*  I'm going to get a side shot here. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7439.96s)]
*  Actually, this works. It's fine. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7440.96s)]
*  Can you see the sound from there? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7443.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7444.96s)]
*  My host dad was in JCP. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7455.96s)]
*  It was very hierarchical. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7456.96s)]
*  The middle school teacher union. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7458.96s)]
*  Romeo is going to check the chat to see if anybody is complimenting him. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7462.96s)]
*  Questioning the... Ask about the plaza accord. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7466.96s)]
*  Don't ask about the plaza accord. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7471.96s)]
*  Does that sound like Zelensky's bodyguard? [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7477.96s)]
*  Oh, I guess so. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7480.96s)]
*  The green shirt. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7482.96s)]
*  But I mean communists also wear green shirts too. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7485.96s)]
*  The source of the battery too. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7488.96s)]
*  Marge is trapped in his aunt's gulag. It's true. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7490.96s)]
*  He is. He is trapped in my gulag. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7493.96s)]
*  The elevators are deadly. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7502.96s)]
*  You guys are so funny, Chad. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7504.96s)]
*  I was like, hey, serious questions only. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7505.96s)]
*  There's a range between plaza accord and asking about Shohei Otani. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7509.96s)]
*  I wonder if Shohei Otani would do an interview with them. Maybe not. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7514.96s)]
*  With the JCP's paper? [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7520.96s)]
*  Yeah, it depends. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7523.96s)]
*  So, Marge needs to go early. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7525.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7529.96s)]
*  How long do we have? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7531.96s)]
*  We're good. He's just going to leave. He needs to be escorted out. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7534.96s)]
*  Escorted him out would be appreciated. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7538.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7541.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7542.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be good. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7544.96s)]
*  Maybe a sip of tea before you go. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7546.96s)]
*  Before you go? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7549.96s)]
*  Where? In there? I mean that's going to be like... [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7570.96s)]
*  It's in camera, right? [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7573.96s)]
*  It's definitely in frame. I've set it up so that it is. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7575.96s)]
*  Ask about posters? [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7580.96s)]
*  Posters? [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7582.96s)]
*  No, posters. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7584.96s)]
*  There's posters over there. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7586.96s)]
*  Yeah, we want to buy merch. We want to get some JCP merch. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7589.96s)]
*  And also, Jeff is a big fan of merchandise. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7593.96s)]
*  Like goods. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7596.96s)]
*  Goods. Seiji goods. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7598.96s)]
*  And you have these little things out in the entryway. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7600.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7605.96s)]
*  How do I exit? [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7607.96s)]
*  Oh, yes. We want that. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7609.96s)]
*  But first, Marks and Angles. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7612.96s)]
*  Yes. The final page of one of them. The final one is amazing. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7618.96s)]
*  I remember because they become... [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7623.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7625.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7628.96s)]
*  Okay, I want all of these. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7630.96s)]
*  I'll get new ones. It's fine. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7632.96s)]
*  Translated volumes. Marks and Angles. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7636.96s)]
*  They made an anime in China. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7639.96s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7641.96s)]
*  I've seen the Chinese anime of Marks and Angles. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7643.96s)]
*  But I've never seen the manga before. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7645.96s)]
*  You watch the anime, then you read the manga. You know what I'm saying? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7647.96s)]
*  I thought the manga was called Das Kapital. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7650.96s)]
*  No, it's about their friendship. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7652.96s)]
*  And where's the final page where they become angels? [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7654.96s)]
*  Wait, they become angels? [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7658.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's so little. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7660.96s)]
*  Is this technically Boyrovu? [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7662.96s)]
*  It might be. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7664.96s)]
*  But Marks needs to go as soon as possible, so sorry. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7666.96s)]
*  Oh, okay. I was thinking... [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7671.96s)]
*  Yeah, sorry about that. We will wait here. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7673.96s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7676.96s)]
*  I swear to god one of these had them ascending to heaven as angels. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7678.96s)]
*  BL, baby. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7683.96s)]
*  Communist heaven? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7685.96s)]
*  That's the question I had. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7687.96s)]
*  What is this annotation? [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7689.96s)]
*  What? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7691.96s)]
*  Why is this like... [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7693.96s)]
*  Oh, that thing? [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7695.96s)]
*  It comes with every book. It's like advertisements and stuff. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7697.96s)]
*  Carl, are you still awake? Hi, dad. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7701.96s)]
*  Wow. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7703.96s)]
*  Wait, I need to find this page where they become angels. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7705.96s)]
*  Are you sure it's not printed backwards in Japanese style so that the end is on that side? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7710.96s)]
*  No, actually it is. It is swapped for English readers. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7715.96s)]
*  No, it's backwards. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7719.96s)]
*  No, it's backwards. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7721.96s)]
*  No, it's backwards. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7722.96s)]
*  You're just so used to it, Carl. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7724.96s)]
*  English-speaking manga is also backwards. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7726.96s)]
*  It is now, right? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7728.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I guess so. Back in the day. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7730.96s)]
*  How do you live in Japan and not notice? [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7732.96s)]
*  I don't read English manga, dude. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7734.96s)]
*  Do you read manga? [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7736.96s)]
*  Yeah, on the internet. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7738.96s)]
*  I was about to say, there's no way you're not a weeb. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7740.96s)]
*  Oh, he's written academic articles about manga and anime. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7744.96s)]
*  I teach Japanese popular culture chat if you're studying abroad. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7748.96s)]
*  It's a blog. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7752.96s)]
*  Sloths are probably already full anyway. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7755.96s)]
*  But yeah, of course I'm a weeb. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7758.96s)]
*  He's the biggest weeb. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7761.96s)]
*  I don't read manga. I'm an adult. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7763.96s)]
*  Dude, what are you talking about? He lives in Japan. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7765.96s)]
*  I'm following like six shows this season. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7767.96s)]
*  What are you watching? It's a prerequisite to live in Japan to be a weeb. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7770.96s)]
*  Let's see. What am I watching? [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7773.96s)]
*  Orb is very good. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7775.96s)]
*  I heard. I'm going to start it. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7777.96s)]
*  I was just on Trash Taste. Do you know Trash Taste? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7779.96s)]
*  Yes, yeah, of course. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7780.96s)]
*  Everybody knows Trash Taste. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7782.96s)]
*  Everybody knows it. Come on. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7784.96s)]
*  I know it. Sorry. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7786.96s)]
*  I told you this, but the new manga that Orb Guy made is about... [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7788.96s)]
*  Really? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7796.96s)]
*  Yeah, it starts with Pizzagate, like the first scene of that manga. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7798.96s)]
*  He goes into Comet Pizza. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7800.96s)]
*  And kills everybody. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7802.96s)]
*  Yeah, but it's dramatized. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7804.96s)]
*  By the way, Chad, if you tried Comet Pizza, it's great pizza. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7806.96s)]
*  He's actually good. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7808.96s)]
*  Ping Pong is very good as well. Wink, wink. No, just kidding. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7810.96s)]
*  Oh my god. Someone must have gotten that, yeah? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7813.96s)]
*  No, but it is a legit normal pizza restaurant that is a victim of crazy people. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7818.96s)]
*  But yeah, what else am I watching this season? All the popular ones, I guess. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7824.96s)]
*  But back to politics. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7831.96s)]
*  I'll find them. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7834.96s)]
*  No, we can talk about anime and manga as well. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7835.96s)]
*  Yeah, but... [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7839.96s)]
*  Let's check. Should we show Chad here? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7841.96s)]
*  Chad, reading for fun in English, manga marks in English, comes with a Japanese text. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7845.96s)]
*  It's recommended for learning everyday conversation in English. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7851.96s)]
*  Is this sold outside of Japan? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7855.96s)]
*  What kind of everyday conversation, I wonder? [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7857.96s)]
*  You don't have dialectical materials when you were growing up? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7859.96s)]
*  Only in Japan, but of course you can buy it through Amazon or something like that. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7861.96s)]
*  And actually, I strongly recommend the publisher and the author to make the digital version of these books. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7867.96s)]
*  So right now it's only available in print in Japan through Amazon Japan. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7877.96s)]
*  Or bookstores. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7882.96s)]
*  Or bookstores. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7883.96s)]
*  The author is our member. She is a veteran trade unionist. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7886.96s)]
*  She taught alone for long in elementary school. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7894.96s)]
*  And now I think she's already nearly 80. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7900.96s)]
*  She watched a movie of Marx and Engels several years ago. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7904.96s)]
*  Then she decided to make manga. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7912.96s)]
*  And a cartoonist, young cartoonist, Kasumi Marukawa. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7915.96s)]
*  She is the daughter of our local assembly members. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7923.96s)]
*  I don't know if she's a member of the party or not, but she knows a lot about our party. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7929.96s)]
*  Importance. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7936.96s)]
*  Oh, I guess. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7938.96s)]
*  Actually, this is one of the first long serial manga. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7940.96s)]
*  And you can see the development of the drawing. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7946.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's very cool. I've never seen these. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7950.96s)]
*  I've only seen another version of the manifesto, but it's only small. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7952.96s)]
*  Not like detailed like this. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7961.96s)]
*  I've seen this. I just didn't know they had it in English. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7963.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7967.96s)]
*  Damn it, we really have no money. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7969.96s)]
*  He's getting the call. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7972.96s)]
*  Shut it down. I know too much. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7975.96s)]
*  It's over. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7978.96s)]
*  It's over. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7979.96s)]
*  You shouldn't show them the manga. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7981.96s)]
*  It's over. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7983.96s)]
*  It's cool. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7985.96s)]
*  A duel. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7987.96s)]
*  Did Marx ever have a duel? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7989.96s)]
*  He did in this comic. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7991.96s)]
*  You gotta have a little bit of violence in it, you know? [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7993.96s)]
*  You gotta put a little bit of action in there. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=7997.96s)]
*  Yeah, they have to have the training art for the school tournament. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8000.96s)]
*  They have a training art for the school tournament. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8004.96s)]
*  I don't know if I can pay my rent. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8009.96s)]
*  There's a lot of people who say they can't pay their rent. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8012.96s)]
*  Oh, I can't pay my rent. Yeah, that's what they're saying. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8015.96s)]
*  Poor rentoids. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8018.96s)]
*  Maybe they even got rid of the ascension. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8021.96s)]
*  How is the chat reacting to these comics? [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8027.96s)]
*  They just keep asking me about... [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8030.96s)]
*  The plaza? [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8032.96s)]
*  They're asking me questions that I don't know if I should ask. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8034.96s)]
*  Let me check. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8039.96s)]
*  Let's see what the chat says. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8041.96s)]
*  So when did these comics get released? [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8044.96s)]
*  What year? Recently? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8047.96s)]
*  Recently. I mean, several years ago. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8049.96s)]
*  But the last one... [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8051.96s)]
*  The first volume is the last year, I think. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8053.96s)]
*  Last year is the fourth volume. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8057.96s)]
*  So this is the last one, I guess. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8060.96s)]
*  Oh, very cool. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8063.96s)]
*  She asked us to maybe buy... [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8069.96s)]
*  She asked us to sell in front of the building. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8073.96s)]
*  Maybe like you, you know, time to time come to our office and are there any souvenirs? [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8078.96s)]
*  Well, I'm sure that if you sold those at the front office, people who watch this stream when they visit Japan... [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8085.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, a lot of people will come and buy these if they ever visited Japan. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8092.96s)]
*  How many people are watching right now? [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8095.96s)]
*  There's... well, we F'd. So we dropped, but now it's at 23,000. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8096.96s)]
*  That's some mine and outs. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8102.96s)]
*  Yeah, 23,000 people are watching about this. So some of them will visit Japan and maybe... [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8104.96s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8109.96s)]
*  You mean 300? [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8111.96s)]
*  23,000. So, yeah. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8113.96s)]
*  It's like a TV show. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8116.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8118.96s)]
*  Cool. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8120.96s)]
*  Round up to 24,000. Okay, whatever. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8122.96s)]
*  Yeah, they're all... they all want to buy. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8124.96s)]
*  Yeah. So if you had a way to sell this, they would... [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8127.96s)]
*  I will tell the publishers to send big packages to the Los Angeles or, you know... [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8131.96s)]
*  Yeah. But it's an international audience. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8137.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, true. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8140.96s)]
*  It's not just LA, but... [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8142.96s)]
*  Okay, so back to politics. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8144.96s)]
*  Is there... like, what is the... how difficult is taking legislative action in the modern diet? [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8147.96s)]
*  Of course, the biggest faction is the ruling party, you know, LDP and Kome Party. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8157.96s)]
*  But the... as you know, after the last general election, the new... [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8166.96s)]
*  well, I must... we might say new phase of the Japanese politics began. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8173.96s)]
*  Because the... for the first time, the ruling parties lost their majorities in the diet in the lower houses. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8179.96s)]
*  Twenty years ago, they lost majority in the upper house. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8187.96s)]
*  But the lower house is stronger than the upper house. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8193.96s)]
*  And so they have now difficulties to get enough votes to get the legislations, especially the budget, get through. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8197.96s)]
*  And we accomplished that kind of result last fall, partly or mainly because of our Acahata scoop. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8211.96s)]
*  It's a really big scoop to smash the LDP candidates. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8223.96s)]
*  But unfortunately, we lost two seats in the diet. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8229.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, we lost two seats in the diet. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8234.96s)]
*  Those, you know, big news did not automatically come to our support. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8239.96s)]
*  So that's the problem for us to get... you know, we obtained more power to get the votes from the population. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8250.96s)]
*  But still, it is a really interesting moment in Japanese politics. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8260.96s)]
*  So we are really kind of optimistic. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8267.96s)]
*  How does LDP maintain its popularity overall? [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8271.96s)]
*  Because it feels like it's almost a... I don't know if this is appropriate for me to say, but an extension of American imperialism. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8274.96s)]
*  It's continuous reign over Japanese politics, especially given its connections, I feel like, in its inception to people who are aligned with the allied forces, American forces in particular. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8284.96s)]
*  Well, that's correct. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8299.96s)]
*  And the influence of the United States is not only the military, but economically, or politically, or ideologically. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8302.96s)]
*  So they have still, well, money over those, you know, power over the mass media. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8311.96s)]
*  But still, they have to get votes in order to, you know, enough seats. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8321.96s)]
*  So they have difficulties now. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8329.96s)]
*  And the source of their power is the first of money from the big companies. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8332.96s)]
*  And also, that is number one. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8344.96s)]
*  And they have supporters in the, you know, major organizations in local areas too. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8349.96s)]
*  But the new thing is that people, you know, gradually understand that those structure, you know, money by politics and policies, you know, and those monies are donated by those supporters. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8359.96s)]
*  But they realize that the LDP itself made slush funds out of those, you know, donations. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8384.96s)]
*  And ordinarily, LDP supporters got really furious, you know. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8395.96s)]
*  So that was the main reason the LDP lost the majority last year. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8400.96s)]
*  And the second thing is the military. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8408.96s)]
*  As I said before, people are afraid of the influence, I mean, the military kind of threat or concern from China or Russia or North Korea. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8414.96s)]
*  So ruling parties or mass media take that issue to the maximum, to persuade people to vote for LDP, you know. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8428.96s)]
*  Unless you will be in trouble or in danger, that kind of thing. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8448.96s)]
*  The LDP will protect the country, is what they said. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8455.96s)]
*  So the task for our party is, of course, number one is to criticize those policies and disclose those hidden atrocities or crimes in like the US Marines and soldiers in Okinawa or other places. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8458.96s)]
*  And also, we have to put alternatives of diplomatic solutions to make peace around our country. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8483.96s)]
*  That is the way, that is the thing I really will explain. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8507.96s)]
*  We have to cope with China, even Russia, to solve the problems, the territorial issues and of course the ecological issues or of course the economic issues. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8513.96s)]
*  That is not the military issues. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8532.96s)]
*  So actually there is a big contradiction inside the LDP policies because they want, LDP and big corporations want good relations with China because they depend on them, you know. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8538.96s)]
*  But at the same time, under the pressure of the United States and big corporations who manufacture their weapons, they at the same time continue the military build-up. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8557.96s)]
*  So that is a big contradiction. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8572.96s)]
*  So if you want a normal relationship and normal economic ties with other countries around Asia, then stop those military build-up, you know. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8576.96s)]
*  Then put more emphasis on the diplomatic activities. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8589.96s)]
*  That is our main alternative. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8595.96s)]
*  And more specifically, Japan should cope more with ASEAN, Southeast Asian countries. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8597.96s)]
*  They are more independent organizations, cope with not only China or Russia but also with the United States. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8608.96s)]
*  They have all around diplomacy. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8616.96s)]
*  So that is our kind of alternative policies. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8620.96s)]
*  What does political participation and political engagement look like for the younger populations in Japan? [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8625.96s)]
*  Is there compulsory voting here? I don't know. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8636.96s)]
*  No, it is very low right now. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8639.96s)]
*  Oh, the voter participation rate is low? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8641.96s)]
*  52%. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8643.96s)]
*  Well, overall, a little bit over 50% in the last election, 56%. Well, less than 60% I think. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8645.96s)]
*  But also, we see young people, not, well, mass media says that these days students are more conservative and they vote for the LDP like that. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8653.96s)]
*  But it is not the reality. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8678.96s)]
*  Quite a few people, quite a few young people, vote in the opposition parties, especially in the last election. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8682.96s)]
*  And part of that, them voted for us. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8693.96s)]
*  And as I said, our structure is like this. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8697.96s)]
*  And we have, unfortunately, party members among students who are youth under 30s, maybe less than 10,000. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8701.96s)]
*  So it is really, compared to the 20 or 30 years ago, it is really very small. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8714.96s)]
*  What about the LDP? [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8723.96s)]
*  But still, those teenagers or 20s, even if we do not have enough members in that structure, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8724.96s)]
*  that is because they directly fine the policies of our party and also become like our candidates or MPs, young MPs, who speak straight against the fascism or so-called fascism or gender equality. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8736.96s)]
*  Or of course the strong opposition to the tuition fee hike, that kind of thing. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8764.96s)]
*  So our task is to reach those students and young guys who are not familiar with us, but at the same time they voted for us. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8773.96s)]
*  If we succeed to reach those people, we will double or triple our membership in that area. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8786.96s)]
*  That is our strategy. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8796.96s)]
*  That is why we are conducting now those big survey companies, campaign, to hear their worries or demands directly or have dialogue on the street or in the campuses or workplaces. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8797.96s)]
*  That is our tactics now. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8820.96s)]
*  What are some of the other big opposition parties? Which ones are they? [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8822.96s)]
*  The Constitutional Democratic Party is the main opposition party and also the National People's Democratic Party. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8830.96s)]
*  The Democratic Party for the People. It is a strange name, but Democratic Party for the People. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8843.96s)]
*  Are these also leftist parties? [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8850.96s)]
*  No. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8852.96s)]
*  Are most parties neoliberal? [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8854.96s)]
*  We are part of. But the Constitutional Democratic Party has some elements to wish to cope with us in order to win in the electoral district. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8856.96s)]
*  Ten years ago, Mr. Abe started to know militarism. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8873.96s)]
*  The main thing is that he wanted or their fellows now want to, the Self-Defense Forces of Japan, to go abroad and fight with the United States Army. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8881.96s)]
*  Of course, it is totally illegal from the point of view of the Constitution. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8899.96s)]
*  That is why even the conservative people stood up against those changes. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8910.96s)]
*  In that kind of mass movement, we had a new connection, a new relationship with the other opposition parties. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8919.96s)]
*  Then you could work together for a while. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8928.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8931.96s)]
*  It has been more difficult in the last couple of years, I think. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8933.96s)]
*  Since Abe is dead. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8936.96s)]
*  Those main opposition parties did not ask for a slashed military budget. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8939.96s)]
*  Our party is the only party in the Diet now to demand a decrease in those military budgets. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8952.96s)]
*  Can I ask, what about the Iwashi Zengumi? [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8960.96s)]
*  Because I saw some people in chat asking about Iwa, because it is getting a little bit more and more attention. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8962.96s)]
*  It is another left-wing party. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8968.96s)]
*  I knew Yvonne like the Syriza or Podemos, maybe like that. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8970.96s)]
*  But they do not want to cope with our party. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8977.96s)]
*  Actually, I must say their tactic is to steal our votes from the left-wing to their party. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8986.96s)]
*  But of course, as long as they want to cope with other parties to stand against the ruling, then it is okay. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=8997.96s)]
*  But I do not know. It is up to them. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9011.96s)]
*  What does their alignment look like? [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9013.96s)]
*  They do not want any alignment. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9016.96s)]
*  They want kind of, we are the strongest, you know, like that. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9019.96s)]
*  But what are they for politically? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9023.96s)]
*  It is not actually about them. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9026.96s)]
*  Actually, politically, of course, they say nice things, you know, slash the consumption tax. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9028.96s)]
*  Which is the same for JCP, right? [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9041.96s)]
*  They raise the subsidies or like this. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9045.96s)]
*  But they do not have the appropriate budget strategy. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9049.96s)]
*  The difference is that there is no policy behind it, I guess. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9057.96s)]
*  What they are saying is to issue more bonds, more bonds. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9060.96s)]
*  Free money. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9064.96s)]
*  MMT. They are MMTists. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9066.96s)]
*  So, we are the party to demand to taxation over the big corporations like Toyota or other companies. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9068.96s)]
*  They have made huge profits, you know, out of the exploitation of 10 workers. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9083.96s)]
*  So, on that note actually, is there, in America, there is a popular appetite for that kind of sentiment. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9093.96s)]
*  To say, I am anti-corporation. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9104.96s)]
*  As a matter of fact, even the right wing has adopted the aesthetics of this sort of policy making. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9107.96s)]
*  Even though, obviously, they have no interest in doing so. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9114.96s)]
*  The Democratic Party also makes inferences towards that. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9118.96s)]
*  But they also do not really do much in terms of taxation either. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9123.96s)]
*  But, given that both parties are pushing for it in terms of marketing, to me that shows that there is a general appetite for it. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9127.96s)]
*  Amongst the voting public. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9138.96s)]
*  Is that a similar thing in Japan as well? [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9141.96s)]
*  Do people view big corporations in a somewhat negative way? [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9144.96s)]
*  Or do they see big corporations in a positive way? [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9151.96s)]
*  As not exploiters, but instead playing a formative role in Japanese prosperity. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9154.96s)]
*  Well, the answer is that, I thought. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9161.96s)]
*  I mean, I think Japanese people now think that corporations are, well, after all, their source of revenue. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9163.96s)]
*  Or they think themselves as part of the company. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9177.96s)]
*  And the presidents of companies usually say that the company is like family. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9182.96s)]
*  We say that too, yeah. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9190.96s)]
*  So, that influence is really big. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9193.96s)]
*  But, so, we have to take account that kind of feeling, you know, sentiment. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9199.96s)]
*  So, our policy is not the... [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9209.96s)]
*  We do not say that big companies are our enemy. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9215.96s)]
*  We do not say things like that. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9218.96s)]
*  But, this is the rational policies to remake our Japan. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9221.96s)]
*  Restart our, you know, good way of life or economy as a whole. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9230.96s)]
*  Those are unfairness, you know. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9237.96s)]
*  Unfairness, you know. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9239.96s)]
*  Too much accumulation and those people who are, you know, struggling with the high prices or, you know, other things. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9242.96s)]
*  It's not normal. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9252.96s)]
*  Not normal for not only for ordinary people, but also for the whole economy. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9254.96s)]
*  So, we propose to redistribute those wealth through the taxation and make money, you know, go around to boost the whole economy. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9261.96s)]
*  After all, our economy continues to go down for 30 years, you know. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9278.96s)]
*  So, that is because of those profit first economy, you know. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9285.96s)]
*  Big corporations first economy. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9294.96s)]
*  So, we have to change radically that. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9300.96s)]
*  But, we say, not radical, well, we use radical, but it is also a rational way. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9303.96s)]
*  So, in order to get votes from not only the left-wing people, but also the good conservative people, you know. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9312.96s)]
*  But, you know, that's our strategy. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9321.96s)]
*  Another question I have that seemingly a lot of politicians try to address is the declining birth rates in Japan. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9325.96s)]
*  It seems like it's a big problem for especially politicians that choose to address it. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9335.96s)]
*  Does the JCP or any party, as a matter of fact, see that as a direct consequence of workplace, work culture and workplace conditions? [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9339.96s)]
*  Not having enough free time and the like, or even having, even socializing in almost entirely a workplace setting. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9353.96s)]
*  Is that a line that anybody in the general public sees? [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9363.96s)]
*  Or is that totally removed from the equation? [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9371.96s)]
*  Because I've seen, dare I say, comical approaches to what to do in terms of addressing the declining birth rates. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9375.96s)]
*  I think there was a politician that wanted to, what was it, make women not go to school after a certain age? [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9383.96s)]
*  Talking about the... [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9394.96s)]
*  The Japan Conservative Party maybe said something like that. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9397.96s)]
*  He was just talking... [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9401.96s)]
*  Sorry, yeah, the Hyakutanoki. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9404.96s)]
*  He was crazy. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9407.96s)]
*  He was talking out of his ass. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9409.96s)]
*  He's like a right-wing radio-TV host almost, right? [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9412.96s)]
*  He does long YouTube livestreams where he just talks random stuff. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9418.96s)]
*  He's your utter... [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9423.96s)]
*  There's many people like me in America too that would do that on the right. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9426.96s)]
*  But now he's the leader of the party with three seats now. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9429.96s)]
*  Yes. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9432.96s)]
*  And it's bad, that guy is... [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9434.96s)]
*  That guy is a best-selling author. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9436.96s)]
*  So the answer is, from us, is raise the salaries. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9440.96s)]
*  At the same time, slash the working hours. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9450.96s)]
*  That's the answer. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9456.96s)]
*  In order to do that, the company needs money. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9459.96s)]
*  Big corporations have enough. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9463.96s)]
*  But probably it's the medium and small businesses. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9469.96s)]
*  So get those internal revenues, profits from the big companies to the government and through government to subsidize those, help the small and medium companies. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9474.96s)]
*  Then they can give more good salaries for the workers and maybe slash the working hours. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9490.96s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9502.96s)]
*  The birth rate itself is really a big problem. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9505.96s)]
*  But mailing and making children is totally individual rights. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9509.96s)]
*  So it's really kind of upsetting for us that politicians talking about the birth rate as a national strategy or like that. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9516.96s)]
*  It's totally a kind of interference in the individual things. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9532.96s)]
*  It matters. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9537.96s)]
*  So what politics should do is to make more good conditions for all young people to have more free time and more budget for the education or daily life and like that. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9539.96s)]
*  There's also another question here as well, of course, which is immigration. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9567.96s)]
*  I would say that the primary reason that America has not fallen victim to the same birth rate decline is because of virtually unlimited immigration. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9573.96s)]
*  This is an issue for many European developed nations as well. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9587.96s)]
*  It's practically a universal issue for all developed nations. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9592.96s)]
*  It seems as though one of the easiest ways to combat that is to open up immigration. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9595.96s)]
*  But I feel as though Japan is not very open to that sort of thing. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9608.96s)]
*  On the surface it is so. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9613.96s)]
*  But in reality we have many immigrants or immigrant workers here as you see. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9616.96s)]
*  At convenience stores or in the pubs or like that. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9625.96s)]
*  In the nursing care. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9631.96s)]
*  It's already a reality essentially. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9634.96s)]
*  So our policy is guarantee the equal working conditions for those immigrant workers. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9636.96s)]
*  They are not called as a worker. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9649.96s)]
*  They are maybe trainees or students. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9651.96s)]
*  That kind of system. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9656.96s)]
*  There's big abuse there, right? [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9659.96s)]
*  There's a lot of exploitation which then also depresses wages for the existing national labor force as well. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9661.96s)]
*  Because then companies will always use temporary workers as a substitute. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9669.96s)]
*  That's right. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9675.96s)]
*  So we have to guarantee the rights of not only young people of Japan. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9676.96s)]
*  I mean Japanese people but those people from overseas. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9685.96s)]
*  In that way we can get more good conditions for all people. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9689.96s)]
*  If you make those minorities and bad things for them. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9698.96s)]
*  Then it will put all conditions down as Mark said. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9703.96s)]
*  So we have to help them. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9709.96s)]
*  Not only because it is necessary but it is necessary for all of us. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9713.96s)]
*  I mean we have a similar problem in America obviously as well. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9721.96s)]
*  Do you guys have any other questions? [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9725.96s)]
*  What is the chat asking? [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9730.96s)]
*  Chat asking a lot of things. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9733.96s)]
*  I don't think we can get through all of this. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9736.96s)]
*  It's a bit much. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9738.96s)]
*  Ask about homelessness. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9740.96s)]
*  Homelessness is not very visible in Japan. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9742.96s)]
*  As opposed to places like where I'm from in Los Angeles. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9749.96s)]
*  It's very visible. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9752.96s)]
*  Is that, is the invisibility, because I know the problem exists in Japan as well. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9754.96s)]
*  But is the invisibility that because of police enforcement? [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9760.96s)]
*  Or is it more so a cultural thing? [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9764.96s)]
*  And also what are ways in which the Japanese government tries to deal with this issue? [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9767.96s)]
*  Well, mixed of those I think. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9775.96s)]
*  But maybe mainly they evict those homeless people before the Tokyo Olympics. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9780.96s)]
*  Or other big events from the center of, in Shinjuku or in these areas. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9795.96s)]
*  There are a lot of homeless. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9802.96s)]
*  Actually we see the homeless people just under the… [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9805.96s)]
*  Under the park? Usually under bridges. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9811.96s)]
*  And I believe on the highway. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9813.96s)]
*  Well, one minute walk. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9815.96s)]
*  You will see more here around this area. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9818.96s)]
*  For sure than in a lot of other areas. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9820.96s)]
*  Sometimes in some of the parks as well. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9822.96s)]
*  And also they go to the maybe under the bridge as you said. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9823.96s)]
*  Or on the river side. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9829.96s)]
*  Because it is controlled by the government, not the municipal offices. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9833.96s)]
*  So you can get, you know, hide in the prosecution. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9837.96s)]
*  And also before Shibuya, Miyashita Park was redeveloped recently. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9843.96s)]
*  And before that it was full of homeless people. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9849.96s)]
*  And some of them tried to actually stop the redevelopment. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9855.96s)]
*  Because they had nowhere else to go. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9858.96s)]
*  And this was a relatively safe public open area to be in. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9860.96s)]
*  But they redeveloped it and now it is just full of izakayas. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9864.96s)]
*  Is there an interest in… [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9868.96s)]
*  Homelessness is born out of obviously the housing market primarily. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9872.96s)]
*  I am not familiar with the Japanese housing structure. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9877.96s)]
*  So I don't know what the housing market looks like in Japan. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9881.96s)]
*  But I mean there is a lot of readily available units it seems. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9884.96s)]
*  Having said that, I don't know if there is any public housing or any sort of initiative to do such a thing either. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9888.96s)]
*  Well, my problem in the housing field is the government decreased those public housing. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9893.96s)]
*  Oh, so there is public housing. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9904.96s)]
*  Yeah, there is. But much smaller, fewer than before. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9905.96s)]
*  And they were privatized. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9910.96s)]
*  Classic. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9914.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And so it is a source of the capitalistic exploitation. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9918.96s)]
*  And in central Tokyo now it is virtually impossible for young people to live on. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9924.96s)]
*  So we demand the Tokyo government to build more public housing. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9930.96s)]
*  Because they have money, big money the Tokyo government has, like Sweden. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9938.96s)]
*  So that is one of the main issues in the upcoming Tokyo metropolitan assembly election. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9944.96s)]
*  Which will be in June? [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9954.96s)]
*  Yes, and we are the number one in the opposition parties in Tokyo. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9956.96s)]
*  Actually, by the way, we are in the ruling coalition in Iwate. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9961.96s)]
*  It is a northern part of Japan. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9968.96s)]
*  Iwate Prefecture, also in the Okinawa Prefecture. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9971.96s)]
*  Yes, yes. At the local level in Japan there are some prefectures or states where the state majority government is in charge. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9976.96s)]
*  I checked also, yeah, the Communist Party now has about 2,000 lawmakers in regional assemblies. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9983.96s)]
*  So we put emphasis on those housing, as you said. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=9995.96s)]
*  And actually it is really weird. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10001.96s)]
*  Actually it is really weird. We have more than 10 million houses empty. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10006.96s)]
*  Yeah, but that is rural parts of Japan, right? [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10018.96s)]
*  Not only rural, in Tokyo as well. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10021.96s)]
*  It takes huge money to demolish those houses. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10024.96s)]
*  So after the owner died, no one takes care. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10029.96s)]
*  Okay. Is there any plan to repurpose the houses that were owned formerly by people? [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10035.96s)]
*  Yes, there is a government now trying to make new systems. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10043.96s)]
*  But it is kind of difficult because of the life issues. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10049.96s)]
*  But anyway, what I want to say is that if you take much use of those empty houses or apartments, [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10057.96s)]
*  then there is no problem for young people to get houses. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10070.96s)]
*  But still, the construction companies continue to build new ones because that is the way to get money. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10078.96s)]
*  That is their business. And that is according to the major policies of the ruling parties. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10090.96s)]
*  So we have to change all those structures, put more money for the public sector. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10101.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10110.96s)]
*  Gradually in Okinawa or Iwate or other parts where our influence is bigger than others, [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10112.96s)]
*  the local governments begin to provide subsidies for young people for housing. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10124.96s)]
*  And of course more subsidies for young families. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10133.96s)]
*  But even that still doesn't address the main problem, which is if there are available units and they are not being purposed, [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10140.96s)]
*  then that could normalize the housing market. Is it expensive? Is the housing market in Japan costly for Japanese nationals? [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10147.96s)]
*  Because as an American I look at the numbers or I look at everything in Japan and it's like affordable. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10156.96s)]
*  Well, our salaries are much lower than American salaries. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10163.96s)]
*  Because of the latest low Japanese yen, 10 years ago it was upside down. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10166.96s)]
*  So that's why people are frustrated, getting frustrated because our country is down and they are going down. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10178.96s)]
*  And if, for example, you were a part-time worker in Tokyo, in central Tokyo, you wouldn't be able to afford to live in central Tokyo. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10192.96s)]
*  You'd have to live an hour and a half or an hour away in a cheap area and then come into the city every day to work a low paying job. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10201.96s)]
*  So they wouldn't be able to afford housing in this area at all, period. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10209.96s)]
*  So the Japanese Communist Party now tries to organize those temp workers for our parties, not only for our parties, but they help them to become members of the trade unions. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10215.96s)]
*  Is there resistance to that from trade unions? Is there any xenophobic attitude towards migrant workers? If you don't mind me asking. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10231.96s)]
*  Well, it depends on the trade unions, but not so because without the temp workers or migrant workers they cannot continue. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10242.96s)]
*  But still, of course, there's a discrimination and a xenophobic attitude towards them, especially from the owners of the companies. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10255.96s)]
*  So one of the problems is there's too much work in Japan and not enough workers. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10266.96s)]
*  So there's less opportunity to kind of like, need to become xenophobic. Like you don't need to find a scapegoat necessarily in immigration as readily. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10273.96s)]
*  So that's actually an interesting point that you brought up because from what I understand, at least everything that I read about it, is that there is a feeling of hopelessness among the Japanese youth in terms of job attainment. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10283.96s)]
*  Even though it seems like the job market you're saying is, it favors workers and yet it doesn't translate to higher wages. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10295.96s)]
*  So how does that dynamic exist this way here? Like what are some of the setbacks? What are some of the ways in which the government is, I assume, keeping wage prices, maintaining wage prices as low as possible? [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10303.96s)]
*  Well, talking about wages, we demand radical increase of minimum wages. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10318.96s)]
*  And minimum wage system in Japan now is, well, it depends on each prefecture. And Tokyo is the highest. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10329.96s)]
*  And what is it in Tokyo? [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10339.96s)]
*  I think almost $1,500 already, an hour. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10342.96s)]
*  $1,000 already in an hour? [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10350.96s)]
*  An hour. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10352.96s)]
*  So that's $9.66 an hour. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10354.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10356.96s)]
*  And that's high for Japan. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10358.96s)]
*  So we demand at least $2,000. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10359.96s)]
*  But the thing is that Iwate water, I mentioned Iwate prefecture, it is one of the lowest prefectures, less than $1,000. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10367.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's around $1,000 most places. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10382.96s)]
*  Yeah. And so we propose government to subsidize those medium and small companies to make more good salaries. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10384.96s)]
*  And we have to change the system that we have to make the minimum wages, common minimum wages around Japan. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10401.96s)]
*  It's now different from prefecture to prefectures. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10415.96s)]
*  And actually, even around Tokyo, workers commute from their homes to Tokyo because wages are better. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10419.96s)]
*  Just 30 minutes or so they can get into Tokyo. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10433.96s)]
*  And then like Chiba, neighboring prefecture. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10440.96s)]
*  Prefecture. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10446.96s)]
*  That's where I live. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10448.96s)]
*  They have bad time, hard time to get enough workforces because young people like the nurses or teachers go to Tokyo to commute. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10450.96s)]
*  So we have to make the minimum wages straight, common, same level. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10465.96s)]
*  And of course, radically increase the amount. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10473.96s)]
*  What about the rural countryside? [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10481.96s)]
*  From what I understand, there's a lot of areas that are now completely desolate almost, where there used to be villages, some semblance of commerce, and now it's almost entirely gone. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10484.96s)]
*  Is there any development projects to rebuild some of these villages and maybe move populations back? [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10494.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, virtually no. Well, very little. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10505.96s)]
*  That is because the government do not have clear target of the food efficiency. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10510.96s)]
*  You know, agricultural sector is really having hard time. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10526.96s)]
*  And our food sufficiency rate is below 40%. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10531.96s)]
*  It's really lowest in the advanced economies. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10537.96s)]
*  Even in the island country, Britain has more than 60 or so. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10544.96s)]
*  But Japan is lower than the 40. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10552.96s)]
*  What are the facts? Why is that the reason? [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10555.96s)]
*  Is it because of agricultural work not being subsidized as much? [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10559.96s)]
*  Or is it environmental factors as well? [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10563.96s)]
*  Of course, environmental factors affect these days, these years. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10569.96s)]
*  But the main thing is that the ruling parties gradually slash the subsidies. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10575.96s)]
*  Compared to 30 or 40 years ago, it's really totally different issues. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10583.96s)]
*  Instead, they opened the market in the rice field. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10588.96s)]
*  That's the last part of the agricultural sector. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10596.96s)]
*  They export rice from the U.S. or other parts of the world. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10600.96s)]
*  The rice is the main products of this country, but it's really ridiculous. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10607.96s)]
*  It's another example of subordination. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10613.96s)]
*  Maybe with the Trump tariffs, if they do tariffs on Japan, then Japan can fight back and rebuild its own rice fields. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10621.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10631.96s)]
*  JT pondon chat. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10633.96s)]
*  So rice or other products we import mainly from the United States or China or Australia or other parts of the world. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10635.96s)]
*  That's why rural areas are now having a really hard time. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10649.96s)]
*  If the basic industry, that is agriculture sector, is maintained, keep going, then people stay there. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10657.96s)]
*  But there are few workplaces there compared to before. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10668.96s)]
*  That's why people come to cities like Tokyo or Osaka. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10675.96s)]
*  Which then contributes to the housing market becoming less sustainable, less affordable, and it creates a whole new line of different products. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10680.96s)]
*  And the developers or financial companies get money out of that phenomenon. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10690.96s)]
*  I have one last question. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10700.96s)]
*  By the way, thank you so much for having us here. This has been incredible. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10702.96s)]
*  So one of the things that I have observed at least coming out here and visiting, you can correct me if I'm wrong on this, [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10704.96s)]
*  is that a lot of aspects of the Japanese economy are very private. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10715.96s)]
*  I mean, they're privatized almost entirely. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10722.96s)]
*  And this has led to, at least from a foreigner's perspective, some confusion. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10725.96s)]
*  Like public transit, for example, is owned by however many companies. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10732.96s)]
*  So you have different railway networks. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10737.96s)]
*  But they're interwoven with one another in spectacular fashion. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10740.96s)]
*  And it does still seemingly work. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10745.96s)]
*  And it's cheap. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10747.96s)]
*  And it's relatively cheap. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10749.96s)]
*  So I guess this is less about JCP and more about Japan in general. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10750.96s)]
*  But I have thought that maybe it has something to do with Japan's sometimes insulated culture and collectivist sentiment, regardless of its hyper capitalist markets. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10756.96s)]
*  What do you think keeps these networks working? [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10774.96s)]
*  Because similar structures in the Western world oftentimes fall apart. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10778.96s)]
*  As a matter of fact, privatization in the UK with Thatcherite neoliberal privatization initiatives completely destroyed the public transit structure that they had. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10783.96s)]
*  In the United States of America, we don't even have public transit. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10795.96s)]
*  Where I'm from in Los Angeles, we do not have a robust public transit network at all. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10798.96s)]
*  Car companies that very famously came in, bought out all of the carts that used to exist in an effort to completely abolish it. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10803.96s)]
*  Our infrastructure is entirely car reliant, for example. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10812.96s)]
*  So how does it, how does the, how does Japanese society still function despite being somewhat of a dystopian capitalist society? [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10816.96s)]
*  Well, mainly I think the, it owes to the kind of professionalism or kind of those efficiency oriented, you know, workforces, you know, work people, working people. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10830.96s)]
*  So we have big respect for them too. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10855.96s)]
*  But as you know, in 1980s, or 40 years ago, during the Reagan and Thatcher era, Japan also privatized the main railroad companies and the other sectors. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10859.96s)]
*  And that affects a lot these days too. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10880.96s)]
*  You said that the, still functioning, you know, it's okay. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10885.96s)]
*  And relatively affordable. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10892.96s)]
*  It must be. But affordable, maybe for you, for foreigners. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10894.96s)]
*  Because the exchange rate is, you know, downing for the Japanese. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10900.96s)]
*  And it's good for the Toyota or other companies to export, you know, they can more money. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10906.96s)]
*  But that shows the declining of the economic power of Japan. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10916.96s)]
*  At the same time, it's not, I mean, just for me, it's a lot, my expectations are also just that it would be more expensive. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10924.96s)]
*  Just even in Belgium, where I'm from, it's not this cheap. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10932.96s)]
*  And I only get paid in yen, right? [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10934.96s)]
*  But yeah, I do understand, it's very, not everybody can afford it. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10938.96s)]
*  But still, it's not so cheap for us. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10944.96s)]
*  Because if you're in Belgium, or in Paris, or other capital, the price of the electric cars or tram or buses are maybe the same, you know. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10947.96s)]
*  In some parts. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10964.96s)]
*  But in Tokyo, there's a difference in prices, you know, according to the kilometers or so. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10966.96s)]
*  And a temporary worker might not receive train fees from their employer. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10975.96s)]
*  And so in Belgium, you would get some benefits if you don't, if you're under a certain kind of income. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10981.96s)]
*  So prices, traffic prices now at this moment is not so affordable. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10988.96s)]
*  So it's a kind of source of the dissatisfaction of the people. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=10994.96s)]
*  Actually. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11000.96s)]
*  So the 80s and that neoliberal attitude definitely, you're saying, contributed to, at least in comparison to what it used to look like, a decline in the affordability at least of public transit. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11002.96s)]
*  But it at least still works. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11019.96s)]
*  Yeah, it works. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11020.96s)]
*  But I might, I may, okay, I would say that, well, it looks like so. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11022.96s)]
*  It is functioning around here. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11029.96s)]
*  But you cannot find those things in rural areas or other parts of Japan. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11031.96s)]
*  Already collapsing, I must say. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11037.96s)]
*  In Hokkaido or even in Hiroshima. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11041.96s)]
*  I'm from Hiroshima Prefecture. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11045.96s)]
*  I'm from Hiroshima Prefecture. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11047.96s)]
*  In the city of Hiroshima City, now a big city, even after the bombing. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11049.96s)]
*  But in other parts of Hiroshima, already the railways are demolished. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11055.96s)]
*  And people are saying that without trains or railways, it's kind of, our symbol is collapsed. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11065.96s)]
*  Or even a bus might be, it goes from five times a day to just two times a day. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11074.96s)]
*  And more accidents in the bullet trains, Shinkansen trains, more accidents than before. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11081.96s)]
*  So they do not pay money in the maintenance. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11091.96s)]
*  But they want to build more, you know, I mean, profitable, like the linear Shinkansen. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11098.96s)]
*  Yeah, the maglev train they're building between Tokyo and I guess Nagoya. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11106.96s)]
*  And really down, you know, dangerous construction work. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11111.96s)]
*  So we are opposed to that project. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11116.96s)]
*  So you can see the already collapse of the, or big devastation or result of the neoliberal policies. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11118.96s)]
*  So that's why people concentrate from the rural areas to Tokyo, you know, Osaka, or some few prefectures. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11130.96s)]
*  So in order to, you know, change the course, get those money from the big companies who profited from the neoliberal policies to, you know, other sectors. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11143.96s)]
*  And also our party is known as a pacifist tendencies. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11168.96s)]
*  And the one reason because young people think our party is a conservative is to, we say, defend Article 9 of the Constitution, pacifist clause. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11179.96s)]
*  That sounds kind of conservative to them, but it is... [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11192.96s)]
*  Why do they consider that to be conservative? [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11197.96s)]
*  Well, maybe the word defend sounds like that. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11200.96s)]
*  You're protecting a thing that already exists while the other side is saying we need to change it in order to bring Japan forward. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11205.96s)]
*  And young people, not only young people, tend to think that something has to be changed. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11211.96s)]
*  Yes, there's a feeling of change. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11216.96s)]
*  We have to do something to change. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11218.96s)]
*  And anyway, but we say defend our Constitution because it is the way to make peaceful life. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11220.96s)]
*  At the same time, it is the way to get enough budget from the military spending. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11237.96s)]
*  So even the other constitutional democratic party or even other progressive legal party do not criticize those military buildups. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11245.96s)]
*  The MPs from the constitutional democratic party, they argue that, oh, we understand some kind of deterrence or kind of military. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11262.96s)]
*  Against China. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11278.96s)]
*  They do not say straight because they do not want China to be angry. [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11280.96s)]
*  But we say straight forward that's the right answer to change the status quo. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11286.96s)]
*  So maybe you gave me a question beforehand and what's the result we made in the dietary section. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11299.96s)]
*  But as a whole, I think the biggest achievement of our party is we have kept our country out of war. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11311.96s)]
*  We kept our government from waging war with the U.S. or together with it, waging aggression of war. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11324.96s)]
*  So I think that's the main achievement. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11338.96s)]
*  Of course, the achievement with the people of Japan. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11341.96s)]
*  So we keep going in that direction. [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11347.96s)]
*  Okay, this is the last last question. I promise. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11353.96s)]
*  Okay. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11356.96s)]
*  You've been incredible. So I have this here and I wanted to ask you. [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11358.96s)]
*  Oh, Travis. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11364.96s)]
*  So, Che Guevara. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11367.96s)]
*  It's a popular cigarette brand. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11372.96s)]
*  Che Guevara. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11375.96s)]
*  Che Guevara. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11377.96s)]
*  So, popular is a popular cigarette brand. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11379.96s)]
*  No, it's not. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11384.96s)]
*  I saw for the first time. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11386.96s)]
*  Oh, really? It's not a popular cigarette brand. [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11388.96s)]
*  Where did you get that? [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11391.96s)]
*  At a conbini. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11393.96s)]
*  Really? [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11394.96s)]
*  I think I've seen it before. Yeah, in Japan. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11396.96s)]
*  Yeah? [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11399.96s)]
*  You got them. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11401.96s)]
*  Never seen it either. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11403.96s)]
*  I think I've seen it before. I've never seen anyone hold them. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11405.96s)]
*  That's why I bought it. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11408.96s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11410.96s)]
*  Where did you get it? [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11412.96s)]
*  Family Mart. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11414.96s)]
*  Family Mart? [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11416.96s)]
*  I'm going to have to check around. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11418.96s)]
*  Maybe for the fallen tooth, I think. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11421.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11424.96s)]
*  But the reason why I ask is, what's the... [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11426.96s)]
*  I've heard, at least one of my favorite Japanese auteurs is a video game producer. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11430.96s)]
*  I love a lot of Japanese video game producers. His name is Hideo Kojima. [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11439.96s)]
*  Kojima Hideo? [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11443.96s)]
*  He is a big fan of Che Guevara. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11445.96s)]
*  And a lot of his video games like Metal Gear Solid, they're very anti-militarist, talking about private military contractors, privatization of armies and whatnot. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11447.96s)]
*  The reason why I ask that is because I wanted to hear what the Japanese society's overall view is of some revolutionary figures like Che Guevara or Fido Castro or numerous others. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11465.96s)]
*  Is there a lot of popular sentiment surrounding these figures or is the attitude against them negative like it is in America? [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11480.96s)]
*  Because in the United States of America, Che Guevara is seen as a very bad guy. [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11488.96s)]
*  Like a terrorist. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11493.96s)]
*  If you're on the right side of history, America usually will declare you an enemy for the most part. [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11496.96s)]
*  So is there a popular sentiment surrounding people like this or no? [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11503.96s)]
*  Or do people just not even know? [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11511.96s)]
*  I honestly don't know much about it. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11513.96s)]
*  I think they would probably just say who. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11516.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11518.96s)]
*  That's a good question in terms of martyrs. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11520.96s)]
*  But in mass media, Che Guevara is not so bad guy. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11525.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think even in America there was a period where, I mean I feel like it's the classic Che Guevara shirt, people used to make a joke about that. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11534.96s)]
*  It was just in Japan too, people wear those shirts sometimes. [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11544.96s)]
*  I don't think it's that big of a thing anymore in terms of even socialists wearing. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11547.96s)]
*  I have seen people sell this at the JCP Sapolta Festival. [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11553.96s)]
*  And I have the T-shirts of Che Guevara. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11559.96s)]
*  The JCP Festival. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11563.96s)]
*  The other thing, maybe the only thing I can think of that's close to this is Kobayashi Takiji. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11565.96s)]
*  Who is a famous author who is still venerated in Japanese canon, but he was one of the founders of the JCP. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11570.96s)]
*  He was tortured to death by the secret police. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11577.96s)]
*  That's the only thing I can think of. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11580.96s)]
*  He is venerated in general as part of the canon of literature, right? [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11582.96s)]
*  But that wasn't really a revolutionary action. [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11586.96s)]
*  I can't think of a figure in Japanese culture that's kind of historical, that's accepted in that way. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11590.96s)]
*  Except, I don't know, Gundam or no. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11598.96s)]
*  Anyway, Che Guevara is still a hero in that area. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11599.96s)]
*  People of that class. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11606.96s)]
*  In Japan too. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11608.96s)]
*  Thank you for telling me. [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11611.96s)]
*  You want it? I don't smoke. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11613.96s)]
*  I don't smoke. [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11615.96s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11617.96s)]
*  For memory. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11619.96s)]
*  Alright, well thank you. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11623.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11625.96s)]
*  Just very edifying. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11627.96s)]
*  As I said, you can buy or subscribe the Akahata, you know, digital one. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11629.96s)]
*  So, I... [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11636.96s)]
*  If you live in Japan or not, you can like and subscribe the Akahata. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11638.96s)]
*  Subscribe with the digital one, I guess. [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11643.96s)]
*  We are having a hard time to expand our leadership. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11645.96s)]
*  If you are interested in the journalism... [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11649.96s)]
*  That's how they fund the party, is by selling the newspaper. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11652.96s)]
*  Oda also likes Che Guevara. [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11656.96s)]
*  Oda? [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11657.96s)]
*  One piece manga. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11659.96s)]
*  Oh, really? [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11662.96s)]
*  You know a lot. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11664.96s)]
*  A little bit. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMT0uoR4azI&t=11666.96s)]
