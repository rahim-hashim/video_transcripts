# Sean Combs Faces Allegations | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs)
*  investigators actually bring criminal charges. What they allege in this indictment is that, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=0.0s)]
*  you know, Oh no, thank you Diddy for hosting this town hall last night. Oh no, no dude. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=4.72s)]
*  Anyone that's like a Trump supporter going well, well, well about Kamala Harris and Diddy [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=12.88s)]
*  don't know anything about Donald Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=18.56s)]
*  All right, let's start with P Diddy. Kara and Ellie, let me go to you. You've worked in the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=20.48s)]
*  Southern District of New York. What is the significance of this being filed there? And [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=29.84s)]
*  can you explain a little bit more about these racketeering charges? Yeah, Jim. So first of all, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=34.32s)]
*  this is a federal indictment. It's been filed in the Southern District of New York, which covers [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=38.32s)]
*  Manhattan and the Bronx and some of the Northern counties. So this will be a federal prosecution. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=42.08s)]
*  Generally, federal prosecutions carry higher penalties, higher potential sentences than state [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=46.8s)]
*  prosecutions. And as I'll get to in a moment, that is certainly the case here. So this is a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=51.44s)]
*  three count indictment against Sean Combs. Now, count one charges racketeering conspiracy and the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=55.92s)]
*  indictment alleges that Sean Combs, along with others who are not charged, but others ran an [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=61.92s)]
*  enterprise and operation, essentially a business that engaged in a series of crimes here. Those [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=67.36s)]
*  crimes relate to in fact, the indictment. Oh, I was thinking about this, like he has a he has a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=72.64s)]
*  lot of money. And he can't really go to like Russia. But why the didn't he just go to like Israel? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=78.4s)]
*  Like, actually, he has so much goddamn money. Just go to Israel, dude. They took his passwords. I'm [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=83.68s)]
*  saying before man, I'm saying before all this he was around. He really thought that like, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=89.92s)]
*  nothing would happen to him. That's crazy. It names the racketeering enterprise, the Combs [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=96.56s)]
*  enterprise. That's the title that they gave the enterprise. So that's count one. Now count two is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=102.32s)]
*  charges by force, fraud or coercion, meaning that Sean Combs participated in transporting women [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  across state lines for illegal purposes by force or by threats or by intimidation. That is an [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=114.0s)]
*  extraordinarily serious charge. If prosecution for the prosecution can prove that the minimum [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=121.28s)]
*  sentence there if they can [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  his net worth is way low, like around 200 million. Did you just say his net worth is way low? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=129.76s)]
*  And then follow that up by saying $200 million? Dog, what are you talking about? Like, are we [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=136.56s)]
*  what has happened with Brandon inflation, dude? $200 million is an insane amount of money. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=144.4s)]
*  He could go and live on one of these like island nations for the rest of his life. See now, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=151.44s)]
*  here's what we're not going to do. Okay. You see the diddler finally get his come up and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=156.96s)]
*  and then there's a lot of white supremacists in here who are rushing to be like, Oh, a no party [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=164.0s)]
*  like a Diddy party. It's like, yeah, he meant he meant like, yeah, he meant that as a warning. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=169.44s)]
*  Okay. He meant that as a warning where he was like, Oh, there's guys don't go to Diddy parties [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=176.96s)]
*  like they're having at the Diddy parties like don't go there. That's what he was saying. LeBron [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=184.48s)]
*  was warning everybody and you guys are out here trying to put a random uninitiated uninvolved [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=190.64s)]
*  black man down. Not just any black man, the goat is up what you guys are doing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=200.0s)]
*  Nick Sean comes on that is 15 years. And the maximum is life 15 year minimum sentence, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=205.28s)]
*  and then count three charges transportation of another individual to engage him. It's sort of a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=211.2s)]
*  lesser included of count two. So we've got a three count indictment racketeering by force and then [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  interstate transportation for the purpose of it's a very serious indictment. These charges are [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=222.32s)]
*  extremely serious. The Southern District of New York does cases like this. They do cases against [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=227.04s)]
*  powerful famous individuals all the time and soon Sean comes will be in court and he will certainly [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  plead not guilty to this and then we'll be underway with the proceedings. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Ali, this is an extremely serious case and Josh Campbell, let me go to you and see [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=241.28s)]
*  what you think in terms of what stands out to you in this indictment. It sounds as though there was [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=246.16s)]
*  a pretty extensive federal investigation here. There was indeed and you know it's interesting [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=250.72s)]
*  we've been reporting all along based on those original allegations which law enforcement [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=255.2s)]
*  sources tell us actually spurred this investigation. He was accused of obviously serious crimes [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=260.56s)]
*  including including women and now we're seeing federal investigators actually bring criminal [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  charges. What they allege in this indictment is that you know. Oh no thank you Diddy for hosting [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=269.6s)]
*  this town hall last night. Oh no no dude anyone that's like a Trump supporter going well well [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=275.6s)]
*  well about Kamala Harris and Diddy don't know anything about Donald Trump. Donald Trump has [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  literally been at Diddy parties. Donald Trump has had Melania Trump at Diddy parties. Donald Trump [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=289.6s)]
*  is literally way more involved with Diddy than any other politician. So the fact that people are [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=296.4s)]
*  like oh yeah okay here we go Kamala Harris Diddy hosted him down hall is so funny because they just [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  have no idea that Donald Trump and you know Sean Diddy combs are directly linked. You know [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  Puff Daddy I'm an entertainer entertain people no matter what no matter what time of day [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  you know whether you like it or not I'll go all day all night. I will tell you that you do [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=324.48s)]
*  fantastically well. Yes. You know just tremendous you really it takes a tough guy hey it takes the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  brains and it takes the this yeah but it also takes a toughness. I go to bed like four o'clock. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=336.8s)]
*  Well I really like you and I would tell you if I didn't because and by the way I think at a certain [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=342.24s)]
*  point everyone will. Beautiful we are human beings and a few people were saying I was just you know [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  I was this violent character you know just because I was breaking people's jaws and arms and look at [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=353.2s)]
*  me I'm like you know I'm just a passionate young man and I made a mistake. Well everybody's going [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=358.32s)]
*  to get in trouble it's a question of how do you get out of trouble. Oh and I did it by working [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=364.56s)]
*  smart more importantly than anything else is by using my own brain. Oh never mind this is fake. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=369.52s)]
*  The talk conversation that never took place between people who never met created using existing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=374.96s)]
*  interviews but these people have met what the why are they making it seem like these people [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=379.6s)]
*  have never met. They've hung out a lot. I got fake news dude. Later that night they both went to a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=384.32000000000005s)]
*  party at Epstein Island. They have that interview is fake but they've hung out a lot dude. There's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=389.92s)]

*  Brett Ratner. Melania Trump and Sean Diddy Combs attend the premiere of Tower Heist. This is real [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=401.36s)]
*  and focused business woman because working for Diddy for six years trained me to have to be [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=408.4s)]
*  perfect. Working for Diddy. Absolutely. I love Diddy. Don's never been whiter. Me too. I love Diddy. My [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=413.84s)]

*  I don't want to answer that. Oh wow I think he's a good guy I'm gonna stick up for him. All right. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=432.4s)]
*  Whoa I think he's a good guy. Oh my god. What do you remember this 2012 app featuring Trump, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=436.88s)]
*  Swift, Martha Stewart and Diddy? No. And we're back and it's time for the News Night Cap. You [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=442.96s)]
*  each have 30 seconds to say your piece. Ellie you're up. My big story this weekend was the New York [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=447.44s)]
*  Times excellent reporting on John Roberts and how he's been putting the thumb on the scale. Roberts [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=452.4s)]
*  and his Supreme Court today and had an interesting headline about uh Democratic lawman was arrested [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=456.24s)]
*  in Sag Harbor after drinking a martini. Count count this is a business as long as I did before [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=462.64s)]
*  we go. Well politicians come and go but celebrity rules everything around me and tonight we've [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=467.36s)]
*  talked about a couple different celebrities. Turns out they were all in an ad together. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=473.68s)]
*  They're trying to do NPR can't let it go so bad by the way it's CNN and yes I'm a ginormous nerd [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  for that reference but that's literally what they're doing. What can't you let go this week? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=484.8s)]
*  In 2012 Macy's I believe leading up to the holiday season had an ad featuring a number of bright [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=489.92s)]
*  stars Martha Stewart, Sean Diddy Combs, Taylor Swift and Donald Trump all in the same commercial. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=495.68s)]
*  Just a reminder of uh people who are wondering like who's more linked up with Diddy. You know [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  we're all familiar with Sean Combs uh media enterprise but they're essentially saying that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=512.16s)]
*  his enterprise existed for his own gratification and you had all of these staff members that were [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=516.88s)]
*  there essentially assisting him in this effort to include members of a security team members of his [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=523.12s)]
*  household staff other employees and as we look through this indictment again that was just [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=528.64s)]
*  unsealed I want to read you one portion which lays out this slew of allegations. They say [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=533.52s)]
*  in this indictment that members and associates of the Combs enterprise engaged in and attempted [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  to engage in among either activities trafficking forced labor interstate transportation for [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=543.36s)]
*  purposes of coercion and enticement to engage in defenses kidnapping arson bribery and obstruction [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=548.72s)]
*  of justice so just a litany of charges there of course Combs himself has said all along that he [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=555.6s)]
*  is not guilty his attorney indicated that he is planning to fight these charges but you go back [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=561.92s)]
*  and look this is really interesting Jim at how Sean Combs originally responded to these civil [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=567.28s)]
*  suits whenever they came out they essentially went after the women who were making these allegations [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=573.36s)]
*  at one point saying you know at least one of them was someone who was just looking for a quick pay [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  day that all changed when CNN broke exclusively that footage of Sean Combs in a hotel here in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=582.48s)]
*  Los Angeles. It is genuinely nuts that he just didn't try to escape like how stupid how incredibly [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=588.72s)]
*  dumb but did he do it yes he did he do it he did physically assaulting his former girlfriend [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=596.96s)]
*  and then we saw his tone start to change a little bit he came out with you know an apology again [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=604.72s)]
*  that stands in stark contrast to how aggressive his team was towards these women and all behind [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  the scenes find it's important to note that there's this agency that may not be a household name but [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  it's HSI Homeland Security Investigations it's an arm of the Department of Homeland Security they [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=619.12s)]
*  specialize in human trafficking they looked at these allegations and indicated there is [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=624.64s)]
*  a federal crime that's been committed here and now we're seeing this indictment they [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=629.12s)]
*  allege multiple crimes yeah it sounds like the feds are just throwing the book at them [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=632.24s)]
*  all right guys Kara Josh and Ellie thank you so much for your time this morning we appreciate it [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JMbC3sPDs&t=636.56s)]
