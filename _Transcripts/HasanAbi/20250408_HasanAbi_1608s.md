# Israeli Media Is Going Crazy | HasanAbi React
**HasanAbi:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc)
*  At a certain point, this contradiction will worsen to such a degree that Americans are going to start despising their politicians even further. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, there's also this kind of dumb shit happening. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=8.88s)]
*  Jake Wallace Simmons post, this advertisement is actually really sad and disturbing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=12.08s)]
*  It shows the bigotry that Israelis have to deal with all around the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=16.8s)]
*  Good people need to stand up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=19.76s)]
*  I don't know what else to say. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=21.52s)]
*  You know, the world is a joke, dude. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=28.72s)]
*  Speaking of Israel getting mad at insane shit, let's cover two issues here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=33.44s)]
*  Okay, one issue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=38.08s)]
*  Number one, Miss Rachel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=40.64s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about Miss Rachel. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=43.44s)]
*  You guys might know who she is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=45.68s)]
*  Miss Rachel is a wonderful beacon of light in a world that is otherwise very, very dark. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  She is a children's content creator. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=53.44s)]
*  Okay, a wonderful human being. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=56.16s)]
*  Miss Rachel also has a conscience. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=58.48s)]
*  And of course, as a human being with a heart who can demonstrate empathy, Miss Rachel is very much against Israel's genocide in Gaza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=61.68s)]
*  There are beautiful visuals from Gaza that the Gazan children have heard Miss Rachel's cries for help. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=70.88s)]
*  And as a wonderful person, you know, there's like children in Gaza that watch her content. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=78.32s)]
*  Okay, this is all she does. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=88.08s)]
*  She's just like a very nice person talking about don't dehumanize. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=89.28s)]
*  Do not dehumanize the Gazan children, the Gazan babies that Israel's killing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=94.96s)]
*  Please, can we not kill children in Gaza? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=99.6s)]
*  That's you might think I'm exaggerating, but that's unironically what she's saying. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=102.08s)]
*  Like she's not doing the glory to the fighters in the fight of revolution. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=106.56s)]
*  She's not doing any of that, which, by the way, I'm not even saying that that's a bad thing to do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=111.68s)]
*  Okay, I'm not saying that at all, but she's not even doing that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  She's just basically saying, can you please not kill the okay. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=118.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is like if Israel was like, Mr. Rogers is actually an anti-semite and we must kill him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=123.92s)]
*  Like basically the Mr. Rogers of our generation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=129.52s)]
*  So what did Long Island's very own psychopath, Leora Ross or what are Leora res do? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=133.52s)]

*  broadcasting the 20 plus million followers across her platforms. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  She's promoted a starving child from Gaza photo, which was actually cystic fibrosis case [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=179.6s)]
*  Hamas false stat of 14,000 kids killed 72% of death or combat age men. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  That's literally not true. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=189.12s)]
*  Fake cold deaths in Gaza photo circulating at this time online were a frostbite taking for Wikipedia [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=191.76000000000002s)]

*  care about that. Yeah. This is the person behind stop anti-semitism. She's the one [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=285.84s)]
*  calling miss Rachel a Hamas sympathizer in the New York post Liora Rez. Nichenko. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=289.59999999999997s)]

*  recognize that they are perceived as monstrous scumbags because I do really think that these [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=336.4s)]

*  said about Hamas cutting titties that he literally did say that he made that false claim directly on [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=420.88s)]
*  the Piers Morgan show that is a direct quote verbatim like I'm not even paraphrasing he said [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=426.64s)]
*  exactly those words the sequence of words that I just said he said exactly but it doesn't end there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=432.0s)]
*  Here we'll also cover this evidence is piling up Pew poll found found more than half of us [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=438.0s)]
*  adults 53% including 69% nice percent of Democrats now express an unfavorable opinion of Israel [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=443.84s)]
*  up from 42% in March 2022. Oh wow look at that. That's crazy. Oh my God. You know what we should [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=450.0s)]
*  do defend Israel harder. That's what our politicians should do. That's what they should keep doing. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=459.28s)]
*  That's this seems like a good cause. It's over. The project is done. Okay. It will be more violent [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=465.92s)]
*  than you could ever imagine and it has already been insanely violent but it's over. There is a [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=473.92s)]
*  lifeline. There is a lot. There's a shelf life to this and it's at the it's at its end. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=479.2s)]
*  Okay. What does the percentage look like among our politicians 100% 100% of politicians offer [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  unconditional loyalty to the nation state of Israel and 53% of all Americans have an unfavorable view [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=491.68s)]
*  of the part I state at a certain point this contradiction will worsen to such a degree that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=499.84s)]
*  Americans are going to start despising their politicians even further. Okay. There's also [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=506.32s)]
*  this kind of dumb shit happening. Jake Wallace Simmons post this advertisement is actually [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=511.76s)]
*  really sad and disturbing. It shows the bigotry that Israelis have to deal with all around the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=516.72s)]
*  world. Good people need to stand up. Let's watch trigger warning. Okay. It's a really shitty ad [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=520.8s)]
*  trigger warning self victimization of Israelis Zionists in particular. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=529.6s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=534.32s)]
*  Greece [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=541.36s)]
*  Italy Sweden [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  Israel [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=546.32s)]
*  Ha [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=560.1600000000001s)]
*  Israel [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=575.84s)]
*  Thank God we can be ourselves not apologizing. Okay. Oh my God. Dude, dude, let me tell you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=605.84s)]
*  something. Okay. This is an entire nation experiencing collective psychosis. Like it's [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=615.2s)]
*  worse than America, which is shocking because America is pretty flashy. All right. But the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=623.08s)]
*  level of perceived victimhood that is self-imposed directly in the heart of every Israeli person is [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=630.16s)]
*  so psychotic to me. Like the victim mentality of an oppressive force that is doing almost [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=639.16s)]
*  exclusively evil in the process of doing crimes against humanity that are in history books. Crimes [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=649.52s)]
*  against humanity that are damn near identical to those that the Jewish population faced throughout history. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay. And then simultaneously turning around and being like, you know, I just can't even defend my [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=665.48s)]
*  state without people looking at me and being like, you're gross, dude. You're a piece of shit. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=672.24s)]
*  Incredible stuff. Now, what's really funny about this? What's really funny about all this, by the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=676.88s)]
*  way? Yeah, this is it's really a national pathology to be brazenly carrying out blood curdling war [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=683.52s)]
*  crimes on a daily basis. And yet somehow still see yourself as the eternal victim straight up. That is [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=690.24s)]
*  precisely what the fuck's going on here. Okay. Now, now what's hilarious about this, despite the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=695.72s)]
*  psychosis that we're talking about is like every American, no matter how fucking right wing they are, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=702.84s)]
*  okay, kind of understands that there is a decent reason for why some countries might not fuck with [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=711.04s)]
*  us. Okay. Like every single American in this chat knows exactly, exactly why if you go to a country [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  and you say you're American, people might go, oh, ew, yuck. Every single one of you kind of understands [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=727.92s)]
*  why that is the purpose. Okay. And even like right wing people who love America will still be like, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=734.24s)]
*  yeah, we did some fucked up shit. Like at least in the rear view mirror, you know what I mean? Like [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=741.64s)]
*  established that it was a universal wrong that is now established in American society, like the Iraq [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=747.44s)]
*  war, you know what I mean? Most right wingers, most Republicans are like, yeah, that wasn't good. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=753.76s)]
*  Okay, what's fucking hilarious about this? And that's why a lot of Americans joke and say they say [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=757.6s)]
*  they're Canadians when they travel, you know, around the world. But what's hilarious about this [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=762.24s)]
*  is the consciousness, the collective consciousness in Israel and the collective attitude in Israel is [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=769.6s)]
*  like, everybody hates us because we're Jewish and not because we are coming from the apartheid state [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=775.84s)]
*  that is doing a live streamed baby murder genocide. Okay, that's why that's what it is. It's [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=786.32s)]
*  just like, oh, it's not the actions of the state that I'm repping that people have issue with. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=792.72s)]
*  Okay, it must be because they're anti semitic. Now, this isn't to say that anti semitism isn't [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=800.0s)]
*  real or doesn't exist or whatever the fuck obviously it is. It very much is real. The problem [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=807.12s)]
*  here, however, is that these guys are these guys are saying directly that as Israelis, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=814.08s)]
*  we are being oppressed, we are victim to other people because they have a conscience and they [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=820.4000000000001s)]
*  don't like that we are doing a live streamed baby murder genocide. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=827.6800000000001s)]
*  More than an airline is Israel. Now, of course, another, this is a fucking airline commercial [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=832.32s)]
*  chat. Just also understand like this isn't like, you know, the Israeli government put out an ad [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=848.88s)]
*  to talk about like how anti semitism is skyrocketing in Europe or whatever the fuck. This [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=854.4000000000001s)]
*  is just a way to sell airplane tickets. Like what level of collective hallucination [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=858.64s)]
*  do you have to be at where everybody gets exactly what the point you're making here [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=869.84s)]
*  and agrees with you and goes, Oh, I can't wait to fly. It is insane. It's actually fucking insane. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=874.64s)]
*  Wait, what another ad by them? Okay, I can't stand these motherfuckers. I'm not going to watch it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=881.12s)]
*  I said quick solution, free Palestine offer reparations, a right to return, punish the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=886.64s)]
*  war criminals. And then maybe one day the world will forget Israel's crimes against humanity. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. The apartheid, ethno, religious supremacist settler colony. You want to defend [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=894.4799999999999s)]
*  so bad is doing a live stream genocide of mostly women and children, which can be often repulsive [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  to people with a conscious. No one thinks you're a victim in this. And of course, every single [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=901.92s)]
*  fucking blue check mark came into the replies to be like, you are hummus. One day we will kill you [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  too. You are hummus. And it's good. It's good that it's a live stream genocide. I like seeing [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=914.0s)]
*  the live stream genocide. Hamas typical Hamas. How was that working out for gossips? Imagine if [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=921.52s)]
*  Jews demanded the same of Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Egypt, and refuse statehood and peace until [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=926.32s)]
*  they got it back. That was 25% Jewish. Oh my God. Oh my God. Propping this up is going to get [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=930.0s)]
*  increasingly expensive. The $100 million Apex spent less election will look like a bargaining [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=937.2s)]
*  very, the cost of winning when you're this badly on underwater. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=940.96s)]
*  two reasons why that's hilarious. He literally said, Oh, Baghdad was 25% Jewish. So it should [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=946.88s)]
*  be a part of Israel, which is once again, an insanely weird ultra Zionist, like supremacist [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=953.6s)]
*  attitude to have. That's the problem dog. That's not how this works. You can have a national, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=963.36s)]
*  you can have a nation where, yeah, you can have a nation where there's 25% Jewish people [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=969.68s)]
*  and not have it be the Jewish nation. Like what a psychotic attitude to have. That's number one. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=976.16s)]
*  Number two, Iraq is the worst example to use because Iraqi Jews did not want to leave Iraq. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=983.12s)]
*  Israel literally started bombing synagogues to tell them that there was great instability [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=990.64s)]
*  for Iraqi Jews. You are not free here. You are not, you should be afraid here. Come to Israel [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=998.8s)]
*  instead. They literally did that. Mossad bombed fucking synagogues. Anyway, the last part of this, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1003.8399999999999s)]
*  what is this? Something I've noticed about Israel defenders that they cling to early post 10, seven [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1011.3599999999999s)]
*  responders. When you push them on the military occupation, that's still ongoing two years later, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1014.64s)]
*  they have largely not moved past their initial films, the rhetoric, and are wondering why people [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1018.16s)]
*  aren't as suede anymore. Yeah. Now, the other side of this story also is that, you know, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1021.44s)]
*  no disrespect, but except all disrespect, Israeli tourists can be really fucking annoying. Okay. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1029.3600000000001s)]
*  And I'm sorry, this is not anti-Semitism. Don't be like, oh, the Jewish state, you're saying, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1037.92s)]
*  no, like this is the same. If Saudi tourists by and large had the exact same fucking attitude, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1042.8s)]
*  I'd be like, yeah, Saudi tourists are insanely fucking annoying. And some, some Saudi tourists [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1048.8s)]
*  are fucking annoying to be fair. Okay. Israeli tourists will literally go everywhere on the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1053.04s)]
*  planet and act like it's fucking Israel there. Okay. They'll be like, oh, where, where, where is [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1058.24s)]
*  the idea of we need, we need to eliminate this Hamas person. No politic, no politic here, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1063.52s)]
*  no politic. So yeah, I'm sorry. If you think it's, if you think that you're in fucking [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1070.96s)]
*  Jerusalem spitting on the person, but instead you're in fucking Tokyo spitting on Japanese [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1078.08s)]
*  people who are demonstrating in favor of Palestine. Yeah. People are going to eventually go, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1084.48s)]
*  you suck dog. I don't want to be around you. Okay. Israel and its defenders are Israel's worst [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1090.56s)]
*  fucking enemy. Okay. It reminds me of the two, it reminds me of the two Israelis that were in Miami [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1097.9199999999998s)]
*  and the one Zionist Miami guy who was also Jewish fucking shot at them because they were Arab Jews [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1105.2s)]
*  and they look like they might be Palestinian. Both parties came out of that process and turned [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  around and said, it's actually the fucking Arabs that are at fault here. The guy who shot at them [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1119.2800000000002s)]
*  thought he was shooting at Palestinians, which is psychotic. The guys who got shot on the other hand [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1125.2800000000002s)]
*  also were like, yeah, we thought it was fucking Palestinians shooting at us. How insane collective [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1131.12s)]
*  delusion. Yeah. Yeah. Screaming at fucking Japanese elderly people that are demonstrating in favor of [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1138.32s)]
*  Palestine in fucking Tokyo, dude. What are you talking about? The world is not your oyster. Okay. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1151.52s)]
*  Okay. Not everywhere is Tel Aviv. You can't behave like this. The fuck do you think you're doing? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  Murderer rapist. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1170.72s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1186.56s)]
*  It's so, it's so crazy. It's just, I don't get it. I don't get it. It is literally fucking mental [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1199.28s)]
*  illness. Like being in defense of Israel is a genuine mental disability where you just start [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1205.6s)]
*  behaving in this way. And the more you defend Israel, the more mentally ill you become. And [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1212.88s)]
*  it's like transphobia, really. There are different levels of insanity that you reach. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1219.8400000000001s)]
*  And the highest stage of this for transphobia is when you start transvestigating people. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1228.3200000000002s)]
*  The highest stage of this is when you just assume everyone and anyone is Hamas and is directly [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1235.2s)]
*  responsible for doing Hamas. But that's what it is. It's just fascism. It's not, there are [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1241.68s)]
*  historic examples of this. Okay. Think about your dumb hog relatives that like are hopped up on [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1247.44s)]
*  American exceptionalism. They behave in a way that's not dissimilar in the question. I guess like you [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1254.48s)]
*  have to be a little fucking brain broken to defend Israel's actions, especially at this stage. So [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1261.52s)]
*  it's expected. But goddamn, dude. Like they're doing a BDS to themselves. You know what I mean? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1267.6s)]
*  Like they're literally just, they're so fucking repulsive in their behavior that they unironically [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1274.8s)]
*  do a self-imposed BDS. I literally know Ashkenazi anti-Synazis really. And he's had Mizrahi [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1282.24s)]
*  counterposes to tell him to go back to Poland. Yeah, no, that's the funniest part. And it's also [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1288.48s)]
*  funny because they align themselves with like non-Jews that are also deeply anti-Semitic. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1293.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's how you create a fucking attitude where Josh Hawley, who is a fucking right-wing [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1301.5200000000002s)]
*  Christian Republican, who will then go yell at fucking other Zionist Jews in a congressional [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1309.5200000000002s)]
*  hearing because they're not sufficiently on board with the mass deportation policies. Like literally [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1315.68s)]
*  liberal Zionist Jews that are like, okay, maybe the deportations are a bridge too far for me. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1323.3600000000001s)]
*  It's giving Nazi Germany. And you got fucking Josh Hawley being like, shut up. He's like, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1328.5600000000002s)]
*  shut up, Jew. I know better than you about how to defend Judaism in this country. It's like, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1332.8s)]
*  what are we doing? What the fuck are we doing? Anyway, you're kind of being problematic with [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1337.76s)]
*  all these stereotypes. I don't know. It's on you're being kind of problematic right now. Okay, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1341.84s)]
*  dude, you know what's problematic? Fucking defending genocide. Suck my dick. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1346.56s)]
*  Anyway, why are you left so angry about multiple progressive candidates in New York city? Seems [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1355.36s)]
*  like people will vote for who they think are better because it just splits the votes. Even, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1361.6s)]
*  even though there's rank, rank choice. I've said this before, but you have no idea how fucking [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1365.9199999999998s)]
*  depressing it is to watch direct descendants of Holocaust refugees supporting modern day Nazi [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  tactics in America, like one to one, there's not even an air of plausible deniability anymore. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1377.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand. I also don't understand how they don't, I don't understand how they don't [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1381.36s)]
*  see how this will fucking inevitably explode in their faces. It's so dumb. The association of, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1385.9199999999998s)]
*  like, this is not the main point that I choose to make. It's certainly not like the most [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1395.28s)]
*  consequential harm that's happening right now. But the reality of the matter is especially because [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1402.48s)]
*  not because like anti-Semitism rising is not harmful, but because that in and of itself, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1407.6s)]
*  while there's still institutional defense against anti-Semitism is greatly escalating [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1412.24s)]
*  Islamophobia in the short term and in the long term, right? Like there's direct fucking [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1418.08s)]
*  deportations happening. It is just, it's still shocking to me that like [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1422.8s)]
*  liberal Zionist Jews and ultra Zionist Jews alike, like all Jews living in the Western world, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1429.52s)]
*  not recognizing that they're on borrowed time in this like dangerous allegiance that they've, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1435.04s)]
*  that they're entertaining at this moment. The notion that they think that they're not going [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1441.28s)]
*  to inevitably be in the crossroads is so fucking stupid. They are so stupid. Muslims and Arabs [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1446.3999999999999s)]
*  are directly under attack. So are brown people in general more so than Jewish people to balance? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1452.72s)]
*  Yes, of course, 100%. There's still no institutional allowance for anti-Semitism. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1456.0s)]
*  Whereas Islamophobia is not only permissible, but entertained and also promoted. White supremacy. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1466.48s)]
*  Adam Friedland jokes about this. He says Jews are still considered white. I am terrified of [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1473.84s)]
*  Jews losing white status, right? He's like, Israel is fucking up the bag because now us Jews are [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1480.4s)]
*  going to lose white status. Like we're going to lose our white status soon because of these guys. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1488.64s)]
*  And he's right. I mean, he's joking, but he's kind of right where like there's a lot of resentment [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1494.88s)]
*  towards, there's a lot of resentment towards Israel and people associate Israel with Judaism [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1500.8000000000002s)]
*  because of defenders of Israel and haters of Israel alike. Like the anti-Semites say Israel [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1507.52s)]
*  is for the Jews and so do the lovers of Israel and even Jews themselves. So as someone whose name is [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3bz9wEDmc&t=1513.04s)]
