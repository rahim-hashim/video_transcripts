# Trump Proposes US Takeover Of Gaza Strip | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI)
*  If only there were people who were yelling from the rooftops over and over again about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=0.0s)]
*  how unimaginably dangerous the Trump administration would be for a multitude of different reasons, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5.34s)]
*  including but not limited to Gaza and that the democratic party should launch the best [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  possible defense against that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=17.54s)]
*  And that they were being pathetic and weak. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=20.04s)]
*  President Trump unprecedented foreign policy announcement last night and I joined up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=24.8s)]
*  He's gave a bunch of children. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=32.28s)]
*  Sharpies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=33.52s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=34.52s)]
*  It's crazy to frame this as protecting men from women from a dude who was found liable [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=35.52s)]
*  for being caught on camera lying about it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=37.4s)]
*  Dude, conservatives love doing that shit. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=40.6s)]
*  They love harming women and then turning around and making it seem like the only way to protect [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=42.8s)]
*  women is by shitting on trans women. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=47.68s)]
*  Anyway, let's get to the, let's get to this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Story as well. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=55.4s)]
*  Expect Japan airlines plane crashed earlier. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=56.4s)]
*  How are you fine with flying? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=59.0s)]
*  I honestly, maybe I'll die. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=60.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=63.96s)]
*  As I enter the United States of America's airspace, the only thing that'll piss me off [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  in that process is how many of the losers will be excited at the prospect. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=70.84s)]
*  I'm going to shit ass mood because I'm leaving Japan and having to face the awful. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  I fantasize about it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=83.76s)]
*  Not going to lie. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  See six foot 190 pounds. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=89.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=90.72s)]
*  That's what keeps me alive is the spite. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=91.72s)]
*  How many go to USA where you're considered enemy of the state? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=93.72s)]
*  Having welcome back to the hog pen. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=96.36s)]
*  I know Robin banks. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for the 10. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=99.76s)]
*  You have the subs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=100.76s)]
*  Prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=101.76s)]
*  He proposed that the U S actually take over the Gaza strip, even open up the possibility [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=103.56s)]
*  of sending troops. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=108.56s)]
*  The Gaza's entire population of roughly 2 million people should move elsewhere is what [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=109.56s)]
*  he said. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=113.72s)]
*  She fight house correspondent, Mary Bruce has more on the president's comments and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=114.72s)]
*  all of the fallout. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=117.56s)]
*  Good morning, Mary. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=118.56s)]
*  Good morning, George. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=119.56s)]
*  This is a brazen proposal. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=120.56s)]
*  President Trump claiming without authority rights to one of the most contested strips [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=123.36s)]
*  of land in the world, announcing plans to display. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to keep it a buck 50. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=129.84s)]
*  This is the first and last thing I'm going to say while this is happening. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=131.12s)]
*  If your number one goal here is to get a dunk on what you have perceived as your true enemies, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=135.04s)]
*  you are revealing that you do not care about the. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=140.16s)]
*  Palestinians are subjected to. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=144.24s)]
*  We already knew that if you were actively telling people to shut up about a giant side. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=145.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=152.24s)]
*  But if your goal here is to be like, see, I told you, Trump would reverse worse. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=153.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=159.96s)]
*  I said that shit too. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=160.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=162.4s)]
*  Many times over a million times over that doesn't change the reality that Joe Biden [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=163.4s)]
*  still did this side had all the power to end it and refuse to. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=167.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=172.28s)]
*  So what you have done in this process is basically demonstrate that you didn't give [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=173.28s)]
*  a shit when Biden was doing it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=177.16s)]
*  And you certainly don't give a shit when Trump is doing it either. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=178.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=181.76s)]
*  So you've already lost the opportunity to even quote unquote resist Trump from a hashtag [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=182.76s)]
*  liberal perspective. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=187.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=188.72s)]
*  You mean how they're subjected to Hamas? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=189.72s)]
*  What lightweight baby safe travels. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=192.24s)]
*  Anyway, he's also just being open about doing the same things. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=194.12s)]
*  Biden was doing quietly, except there's a lot of a lot less death actively happening. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=197.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=201.76s)]
*  So we went from Joe to side down. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=205.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=206.44s)]
*  But for people that immediately run to, you know, make it seem like they give a shit, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  they don't. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=215.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=216.44s)]
*  Hope everyone's happy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=217.44s)]
*  Now that they got Joe out of the office is like, what do you mean? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=218.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  He was what, what do you, what are we, are we joking? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  Was he not doing it? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=223.82s)]
*  Like all of a sudden that's how you can tell who has a heart or not. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=224.82s)]
*  I told you so is not fun to do when there's someone suffering and you were just right [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=227.48s)]
*  about it happening one way or another. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=230.64s)]
*  You're not going to hear me say, I told you so, even though I did say this because I'm [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=232.88s)]
*  not a, okay. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=238.11999999999998s)]
*  Same goes for my former podcast co-host. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=239.72s)]
*  I think it was Sean the black who said, if you got a longer compilation of you saying [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=241.64s)]
*  the N word with a hard R then the amount of times that you've spent on defending Palestinians, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=246.28s)]
*  then we got a problem. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Maybe you don't give a fuck about them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=253.88s)]
*  Maybe you didn't care under any leadership. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=256.09999999999997s)]
*  You can try to present yourself as caring, but if your ambitions and your motivation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=259.24s)]
*  simply revolves around the, you know, calling your former podcast co-host and anti-Semite [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=263.32s)]
*  and a radical terrorist over and over again, perhaps most people who do care about the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=268.88s)]
*  issue understand that you don't, then I won't be voting for Democrats. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=273.54s)]
*  Now Democrats do something around and find out like, what is this man? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=279.64s)]
*  So is this, so is this? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  So you just don't give a shit. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=284.86s)]
*  And for the record, this is not just about Gaza for me either. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  I've said this exact same thing about undocumented migrants. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=293.2s)]
*  I said the exact same thing in the aftermath of Trump's electoral victory in the aftermath [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=294.2s)]
*  of Trump's electoral victory, Democrats were talking about how they're going to call ice [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=299.76s)]
*  on their neighbors that they, if they have any immediate family members of undocumented [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  neighbors that they have that have voted for Trump, they're going to call their, they're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=309.84s)]
*  going to call ice on the neighbors. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=313.32s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=314.32s)]
*  And then just, you are a, you're not an ally. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=315.32s)]
*  You're not a friend. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=317.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=318.94s)]
*  Like you're a ginormous, you're a bad person. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=319.94s)]
*  You are no different than the Republicans that I hate. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=326.64s)]
*  And the same goes for this as well. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=330.52s)]
*  Sean's other banger, any creator for comma that refused to DNC access, we go for Palestinian [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=334.2s)]
*  liberation right off. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=338.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=340.6s)]
*  Biden absolutely paved the way for Trump to continue the yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=341.8s)]
*  And ironically enough, Trump paved the way for October 7 to happen because American foreign [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=346.12s)]
*  policy is unit party and they only go in one direction. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=355.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=356.12s)]
*  Right when cope just did this, just followed an ice report against the grandma, the Indian [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=357.56s)]
*  kid, he almost car because she overstayed her visa dark woke. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how I feel about that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=365.16s)]
*  It's a dark world. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=367.72s)]
*  It was just a meme for the most part. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=368.72s)]
*  I think dark woke is when you're supposed to actually be ruthless to the individual [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=370.8s)]

*  not believe how many people are saying you brainwash them. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1182.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1185.0200000000002s)]
*  But tick tock or defended you rejected his invite to debate on a show recently. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1186.0200000000002s)]
*  He's so scared of someone with a comparable size of audience. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1188.98s)]
*  Oh, he wants to debate other people. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1191.0200000000002s)]
*  He doesn't want to debate me. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1193.62s)]
*  He wants to debate other people about me. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1195.58s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1198.2399999999998s)]
*  I'm the fucking subject matter. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1199.6599999999999s)]
*  Just talk to me. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1201.5s)]
*  Why are you so afraid? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1202.5s)]
*  Why are you so afraid of having a conversation? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1204.54s)]
*  Like the number one reason why this is a idiotic point of contention is because I have already [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1206.3799999999999s)]
*  addressed all the fucking talking points and people still go, can you address them? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1212.3799999999999s)]
*  Can you watch the video? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1216.4599999999998s)]
*  Can you address the video? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1218.34s)]
*  It's like I have, I addressed it three months before the video ever came out. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1219.34s)]
*  I'm fucked because you won't watch the vid. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1223.3400000000001s)]
*  No, that's an idiotic reason, dude. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1225.66s)]
*  Then it should be that you should be able to destroy me now. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1227.8200000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1230.94s)]
*  You should be able to destroy me even easier. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1231.94s)]
*  If I don't watch the subject matter, you could just like sit there and show all of the clips [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1232.94s)]
*  out of context directly to my face. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1236.6200000000001s)]
*  And if you want me to explain the context of the clips, we can do that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1240.02s)]
*  And perhaps that might be a little too scary for you. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1243.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, that's the funniest part about this is that like me watching the video would be [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1246.0800000000002s)]
*  worse for you overall. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1250.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1251.78s)]
*  And he's also still actively trying to deplatform me too. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1252.78s)]
*  And on the Dearborn voters, we're not, we're saying that the Gaza thing was a non-issue [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1256.74s)]
*  during the election. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1261.7s)]
*  So you have no credibility. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1262.86s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1263.86s)]
*  It's a guilty conscience. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1264.86s)]
*  They know that that all their actions say you watching clips of other people watching [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1266.74s)]
*  the videos only inflame that argument. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1270.1s)]
*  To be honest, brother, if I was afraid, if I was afraid, why wouldn't I, why would I [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1271.46s)]
*  just simply run away? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1277.82s)]
*  Why wouldn't I just run away from the conversation? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1279.1399999999999s)]
*  If I was afraid of seeing the talking points or hearing the talking points, why wouldn't, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1281.22s)]
*  why would I come out and say, let's have a conversation? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1288.2s)]
*  This is the stupid part that most people do not understand. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1294.94s)]
*  He's using the video as a way to be like, Oh, just watch the video. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1296.1000000000001s)]
*  Please just watch the video. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1299.22s)]
*  Please. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1300.38s)]
*  This doesn't make any sense. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1301.38s)]
*  Just say you watched it and then leave it at that. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1302.56s)]
*  No, I'm not going to fucking lie. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1304.26s)]
*  It's so funny because he'll complain about the clips. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1305.8600000000001s)]
*  He'll complain about me watching his clips out of context. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1309.5s)]
*  Ironically enough, his entire video is out of context. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1312.58s)]
*  You know, I'm in the video. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1315.78s)]

*  It's real. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1320.66s)]
*  They're DMing smaller creators. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1321.66s)]
*  The debate, I just turned down an opportunity to go onto H3. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1322.66s)]
*  They reached out to me because of my Elon video and they asked if I wanted to come [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1325.3799999999999s)]
*  onto the show. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1328.3799999999999s)]
*  I said no, because I have been watching recently and I can tell that Ethan is operating purely [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1329.3799999999999s)]
*  out of bad faith. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1333.5s)]
*  It would just wait. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1334.5s)]
*  This fucking coward is demanding that random take talkers go and debate him on the video. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1337.18s)]
*  I'm the subject matter. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1345.94s)]
*  That's crazy, dude. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1348.54s)]

*  supposed opinions. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1392.06s)]
*  So why would referencing the video even matter? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1393.38s)]
*  Shouldn't Ethan want to expose your actual opinions on this? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1395.0600000000002s)]

*  whole time. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1533.44s)]

*  into quote the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1557.44s)]
*  This morning, a stunning proposal from an American president, Donald Trump with the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1560.44s)]
*  Israeli prime minister by his side, declaring that the U.S. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1565.44s)]
*  will take over the Gaza Strip and calling for the permanent resettlement of roughly [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1569.44s)]
*  two million Palestinians. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1573.44s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1575.44s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1580.44s)]
*  other weapons on the site. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1585.44s)]
*  And he says he's willing to use the U.S. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1587.44s)]
*  military to do it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1589.44s)]
*  We'll do what is necessary. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1591.44s)]
*  If it's necessary, we'll do that. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1593.44s)]
*  We're going to take over that piece and we're going to develop it, create thousands and [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1595.44s)]
*  thousands of jobs. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1599.44s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu seemingly on board with the plan. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1600.44s)]
*  I think it's something that could change history and it's worthwhile really pursuing this [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1603.44s)]
*  avenue. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1609.44s)]
*  The real estate mogul turned president touting the potential opportunity. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1610.44s)]
*  I don't want to be cute. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1614.44s)]
*  I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1615.44s)]
*  that could be so bad. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1619.44s)]
*  This could be so magnificent. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1620.44s)]
*  But Trump provided no details on how he could do this or on what authority he could take [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1622.44s)]
*  over the sovereign territory. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1627.44s)]
*  His proposal likely a violation of international law. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1629.44s)]
*  I do see a long term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1632.44s)]
*  part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East and everybody I've spoken to. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1639.44s)]
*  This was not a decision made lately. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1644.44s)]
*  The big question who would live there? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1646.44s)]
*  Trump broadly suggesting everyone is welcome, but he made it clear. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1648.44s)]
*  Dude, the international law, like international law is over. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1652.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1656.44s)]
*  It's never been more over than at this moment. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1657.44s)]
*  Joe Biden already basically destroyed it, especially important to address because he [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1660.44s)]
*  suppose he was supposed to be the reasonable adult in the room. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1666.44s)]
*  That wasn't like Donald Trump that would renege on like previous American foreign policy decisions [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1669.44s)]
*  like Donald Trump did when he destroyed the Iran denuclearization agreement and things [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1675.44s)]
*  like that. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1678.44s)]
*  And Donald Trump came in and was like, yeah, no, what do you mean? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1679.44s)]
*  International rule-based order. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1683.44s)]
*  I make the rules. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1684.44s)]
*  I give you the orders. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1685.44s)]
*  You follow them. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1686.44s)]
*  That's just how it's supposed to work. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1687.44s)]
*  Which in some respects is honest. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1689.44s)]
*  It's brutally honest, right? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1692.44s)]
*  There's honesty there. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1694.44s)]
*  There's truth there. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1695.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1696.44s)]
*  But it's over. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1697.44s)]
*  It's done. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1699.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is once again, showcasing that it's super done in many respects. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1700.44s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of well-intentioned people out here and their perspective on America's [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1706.44s)]
*  placement around the planet, especially in places like Japan. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1716.44s)]
*  And this was championed by the JCP as well. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1719.44s)]
*  This perspective was and people that are constantly in their minds living under the, the ever [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1722.44s)]
*  present threat of China and Russia, right? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1731.44s)]
*  Outside of the sphere of American influence, they were truly terrified of a lot of repudence [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1736.44s)]
*  actions, which is understandable. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1742.44s)]
*  I think we here in the United States of America, even though I'm in Japan right now, don't [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1743.44s)]
*  necessarily see the, the threat of a despot or a tyrant or someone who is just like willing [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1747.44s)]
*  to just go, nah, I'm taking this shit. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1755.44s)]
*  It's mine now outside of the United States of America. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1758.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1762.44s)]
*  And we're far removed. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1763.44s)]
*  So even if we're far removed from the impact of it. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1765.44s)]
*  So even if let's say the fears are unfounded because of the limitations that the Russian [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1769.44s)]
*  state has in terms of taking over the entirety of Ukraine and then possibly moving into Poland, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1775.44s)]
*  like even if all of that is, is, is impossible given the actual limitations. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1780.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1789.44s)]
*  I think that a lot of repudence actions, unjustifiable actions in Ukraine, violent actions, Ukraine [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1790.44s)]
*  have truly terrified a lot of people living under the sphere of Western influence. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1796.44s)]
*  They are scared that this entire process can just kind of fall apart. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1804.44s)]
*  If someone just goes, nah, I'm not fucking around with this any longer. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1810.44s)]
*  This is mine. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1813.44s)]
*  I'm just going to violate all the norms. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1814.44s)]
*  The only country that is able to violate those norms is the United States of America, because [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1816.44s)]
*  when it does, when it does violate those norms, it does it through the rule-based international [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1820.44s)]
*  order to a certain degree. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1825.44s)]
*  And while someone like myself might not, might see the truth in that and still get frustrated [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1827.44s)]
*  endlessly. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1834.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1835.44s)]
*  This past, this past year has shown that America aligned with Israel, which is an extension [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1836.44s)]
*  of America, never forget is also capable of doing Vladimir Putin shit. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1843.44s)]
*  And I think a lot of America's allies are on the one hand scared that, you know, Vladimir [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1849.44s)]
*  Putin is a bad guy, but they're also now scared that Donald Trump is a bad guy in the exact [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1858.44s)]
*  same way. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1864.44s)]
*  The collapse of the, the belief that America's allies have in the rule-based international [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1865.44s)]
*  order is going to lead to real consequences of diminished soft power for America. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1874.44s)]
*  And in that process, America will no longer be the hegemonic superpower. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1884.44s)]
*  And as I repeat over and over again, those 800 military bases will now look like 800 [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1890.44s)]
*  military occupations. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1896.44s)]
*  Like think about that. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1897.44s)]
*  Europeans are terrified of Vladimir Putin for what? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1899.44s)]
*  For what? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1901.44s)]
*  What's the reason? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1902.44s)]
*  Because he's a mad man and he has shown his proclivity for land grabs. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1903.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1907.44s)]
*  And we're talking about new land grabs. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1908.44s)]
*  If you already did the land grabs, if you engaged in colonialism and you still have [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1911.44s)]
*  like colonial remnants within your economic infrastructure, like, you know, maybe you [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1915.44s)]

*  That's different in the minds of the Europeans. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1924.44s)]
*  They look at that in a very different way. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1926.44s)]
*  They're like, well, that's just business as usual. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1928.44s)]
*  That already happened in the past. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1930.44s)]
*  But when you got a fucking dude who's going, I'm taking a piece of a country on the European [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1931.44s)]

*  Hold on. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1939.44s)]
*  But now you got Donald Trump saying he also wants a piece, you know, you got Donald Trump [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1940.44s)]
*  straight up being like, I'm taking, I'm taking Greenland. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1946.44s)]

*  is something that I think a lot of people are understandably afraid of. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1965.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1969.44s)]
*  It makes sense because in some ways it is very Adolf Hitler, especially considering [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1970.44s)]
*  that he also wants to do internal concentration camps for the undesirables that live on us [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=1977.44s)]

*  Stein. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2411.1s)]

*  I'm ending the death and destruction and frankly, bad luck. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2553.46s)]

*  Years earlier in the Oval Office, the president argued Palestinians have no choice but to [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2565.1s)]

*  If we could find the right piece of land or numerous pieces of land and build them some [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2571.9s)]
*  really nice places with plenty of money in the area, that's for sure. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2577.94s)]
*  I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2582.2599999999998s)]
*  Shortly after welcoming Netanyahu to the White House, Trump digging in, asked point blank [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2586.42s)]
*  if he believes Palestinians have a right to return. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2591.5s)]
*  It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn't [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2595.02s)]
*  want to return. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2599.54s)]
*  Why would they want to return? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2600.54s)]
*  The place has been hell. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2602.14s)]
*  It's been one of the meanest, one of the meanest, toughest places on earth. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2604.3s)]
*  And then just hours later, that shocking declaration that he envisions the U.S. taking over Gaza [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2609.48s)]
*  entirely. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2614.74s)]
*  After 16 months of war, the devastation is massive. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2615.74s)]
*  But even amid the destruction, since the ceasefire was announced last month, Palestinians returning [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2619.74s)]
*  to their homes, those images, hundreds of thousands determined to get back. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2624.7s)]
*  In Gaza this morning, Palestinians strongly rejecting Trump's proposal. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2629.66s)]
*  This man saying, we are staying steadfast in our land here. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2636.74s)]
*  Whoever wants to rebuild should not kick us out under the pretext of rebuilding. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2640.14s)]
*  But the president now insists that Egypt and Jordan should take them in, an idea those [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2644.3399999999997s)]
*  countries have fiercely rejected. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2648.58s)]
*  Well, I think Jordan and Egypt will. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2650.42s)]
*  I know they've spoken about it with you and they say they're not going to accept. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2652.7799999999997s)]
*  I say they will. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2656.8599999999997s)]
*  Democrats say the president's proposal is ridiculous. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2657.8599999999997s)]
*  What he's saying is dangerous because it will put U.S. interests in the Middle East at risk. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2661.2999999999997s)]

*  Now President Trump is making this proposal even as the U.S. has been working to secure [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2672.58s)]
*  the second phase of this ceasefire deal, which intends to bring about the release of the [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2675.98s)]
*  remaining hostages and a permanent end to fighting. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2680.22s)]
*  Negotiations that were incredibly difficult even before President Trump made this new [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2682.7799999999997s)]
*  announcement. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2687.18s)]

*  Well, yeah, Mary, there's so many questions there, including this simply flies in the [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2689.8199999999997s)]
*  face of everything President Trump has said in the past about pulling back the American [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2693.2999999999997s)]

*  It certainly does, George. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2699.8199999999997s)]
*  This goes against the promises that the president made on the campaign trail. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2701.2599999999998s)]
*  These are exactly the kinds of conflicts that he has tried to avoid and that the U.S. has [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2704.2999999999997s)]
*  tried to avoid in the Middle East for decades. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2708.66s)]
*  Inside Gaza, President Trump's idea has been met with outrage from Palestinians determined [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2711.5s)]

*  This president, who is called Donald Trump, comes to us with a new method to displace [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2732.7s)]
*  us from our country where we are rooted. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2737.1s)]
*  This man says this is our land. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2739.38s)]
*  We will not get out of it. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=2741.9s)]

*  We reject Trump's decisions and those of his aides and supporters who push for displacement. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3241.06s)]
*  Why should we be forced into displacement? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3245.2999999999997s)]
*  We remain here. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3248.02s)]
*  Even if it means living on the rubble of our homes, better that than living in humiliation [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3249.18s)]

*  Garza is not a place for people to be living and the only reason they want to go back and [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3262.9s)]
*  I believe this strongly is because they have no alternative. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3267.86s)]
*  What's the alternative? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3270.34s)]

*  It took Israel that ethnic cleansing in 1948, the military occupation of 1967, the colonization [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3287.14s)]
*  and the theft of land and the system of oppression and apartheid and all the way to the genocide. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3294.46s)]
*  I guarantee this was part of the ceasefire deal. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3300.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I told you, I told you that they had designs for at least doing a permanent military [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3302.38s)]
*  installation in Northern Gaza and that their designs for, for the West bank was the permanent [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3309.82s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3318.62s)]
*  I don't know what the, what else to say about the situation. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3319.62s)]
*  I said it even after we talked about Donald Trump pushing for the ceasefire. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3325.1400000000003s)]
*  I told you that there was probably, there was probably going to be some additional, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3329.58s)]
*  some additional things that the guy who got a hundred million dollars for Miriam, Miriam [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3335.78s)]
*  Adelson was going to do. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3341.58s)]

*  The US president's proposal has come at a perfect moment for him. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3362.6200000000003s)]
*  It is a political lifeline for the Israeli prime minister. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3367.02s)]
*  I think that it is crucial today to consider and examine ideas that are out of the box. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3372.06s)]
*  After all, Gaza is a failed experiment. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3376.78s)]
*  It's certainly failed under Hamas rule. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3379.1s)]
*  Anyone with their eyes open understands that Gaza in its current state has no future. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3383.46s)]
*  The forced removal of Palestinians from Gaza would be ethnic cleansing. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3389.62s)]
*  Trump has given no detail how it would work and it has no backing from Western allies. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3394.06s)]
*  And with negotiations just starting to extend the Gaza ceasefire, it is a very risky and [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3399.26s)]
*  possibly dangerous move. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3406.54s)]

*  It's just crazy that like every day there is a fresh hell. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3469.02s)]
*  Every day, these images and even far more gruesome images than this one have been burned [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3473.98s)]
*  into the collective consciousness of so many, especially those who don't only consume mainstream [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3481.06s)]
*  outlets. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3487.2599999999998s)]
*  Now mainstream outlets are, you know, 16 months late to the game, but finally covering it [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3488.2599999999998s)]
*  with some truth and dignity, perhaps a little, you know, a little too late. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3492.3s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3498.4199999999996s)]
*  I don't know where it's going to go because I don't want to lose out on hope that, you [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3499.8199999999997s)]

*  won't amount to anything. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3510.74s)]
*  But you know, I am worried. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3512.3799999999997s)]
*  You just can't give up. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3521.5s)]
*  These people are not giving up. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3522.54s)]
*  So you can't either. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3523.66s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3524.66s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3525.66s)]
*  Their existence is resistance. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3527.1s)]

*  for them as well. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3541.58s)]

*  These family reunions have been a long time coming and they're complicated, full of joy, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3609.46s)]
*  delayed bereavement too. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3614.74s)]
*  And these are the people Donald Trump says should leave Gaza. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3620.74s)]
*  He is a real estate man. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3625.9399999999996s)]
*  But what price, what specifications could an estate agent put on this home? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3628.2599999999998s)]
*  After the horrific October 7th attack on Israel, when about 1,200 people were killed and two [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3639.2599999999998s)]
*  hundred and fifty others were taken hostage, Israel launched a war to destroy Hamas. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3644.62s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people were killed in the process and much of that territory is [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3649.98s)]
*  in ruins today. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3654.18s)]
*  So yesterday, President Trump made this suggestion for what could happen next. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3655.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3660.3399999999997s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3661.74s)]
*  And I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3666.74s)]
*  East, this could be something that could be so magnificent. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3671.34s)]
*  But more importantly than that is the people that have been absolutely destroyed that live [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3676.02s)]
*  there now can live in peace in a much better situation because they're living in hell. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3681.32s)]
*  Now the plan would also involve relocating more than two million Palestinians. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3688.92s)]
*  We're joined now by the president's national security advisor, that's Mike Waltz. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3693.14s)]
*  Mr. Waltz, thank you so much for joining us. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3697.38s)]
*  We're all looking forward to this conversation. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3699.2599999999998s)]
*  We really appreciate you taking the time. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3701.18s)]
*  So yesterday when the president made that announcement yesterday, ran that proposal, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3703.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm told I wasn't there, but I'm told that a lot of jaws dropped, that there was gasping [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3710.74s)]
*  in the room. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3715.3399999999997s)]
*  And I guess my first question for you is what right do we, the U S have to do this? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3716.3399999999997s)]
*  When you have two million Palestinians that say, listen, this is our home. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3721.58s)]
*  We don't want to leave. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3725.22s)]
*  We want to rebuild. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3726.54s)]
*  I'm telling you that the overwhelming majority of liberals on at least social media apps [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3728.94s)]
*  saw this as yet a another opportunity to fucking dunk on the, the genocided people's immediate [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3734.3s)]
*  family members living in the United States of America, despite the reality that like [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3746.78s)]
*  third party voters could not have actually made up for Kamala Harris's issues. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3750.94s)]
*  I don't know if liberals will look to the situation and go even with all of their hatred [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3754.86s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3759.3s)]
*  I don't know if liberals will look to this issue and go, okay, maybe we are the bad guys. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3760.3s)]
*  Like this should be a wake up moment. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3764.1800000000003s)]
*  This doesn't even feel like real life anymore. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3765.6600000000003s)]
*  I can't believe the things that are happening again. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3767.1s)]
*  These absolutely smug, nasty people who had nothing to say when Biden Harris were slaughtering, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3769.54s)]

*  This is an NBC news reporter. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=3779.6600000000003s)]

*  If you had actually shout on Harris and praise Stein. No, I think Jill Stein is not like a [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4327.38s)]
*  competent nor serious political actor. It wasn't because I wanted to subtly defend Kamala Harris. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4332.42s)]
*  It's just my opinion. Most Americans support Israel. So she couldn't be saying she supports [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4338.26s)]
*  Palestinians. This is not correct either. This is just not correct. There were numerous studies, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4342.5s)]
*  numerous polls that were conducted throughout this entire process. The overwhelming majority [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4350.1s)]
*  of Americans wanted to cease fire. The overwhelming majority of Democrats wanted it more than 80% [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4355.62s)]
*  more than 70% of independence wanted it. And even more than 50%, the majority of Republicans [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4362.34s)]
*  wanted to cease fire. Okay. There were plenty of polls that also showed that the weapons embargo [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4369.06s)]
*  would help Kamala Harris win. But Gaza is not the singular reason why she lost. It was majorly [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4375.7s)]
*  consequential, especially in a state like Michigan. Okay. But what's more important to understand here [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4383.22s)]
*  is that this inability to read the room or deliberately refusing to read the room is at [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4391.7s)]
*  the heart of the democratic party's problems with the electoral performance. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4399.62s)]
*  Even when people were ringing the alarm bells as best as they could with mass mobilization protests, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4405.86s)]
*  they just turned a blind eye to it because they were beholden to their donors. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4413.54s)]
*  Okay. They're completely shut off from the wishes and the demands of their base of support. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4418.099999999999s)]
*  So it's not just Gaza. This very same principle exists for a number of different issues, whether [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4425.94s)]
*  it be healthcare, okay. Whether it be price controls. You always said commas loss will [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4431.62s)]
*  mostly be on our inability to break from Biden and her closeness to Republicans by associating [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4437.46s)]
*  with Cheney and the right wing border bill. Yes, absolutely. It's crazy. Everyone is spamming [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4441.0599999999995s)]
*  and shooting on liberals right now. This was genuinely the one space we say space we had, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4446.42s)]
*  you guys are no better than the Magatars. People are about to get ethnic cleansing. The reaction [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4450.82s)]
*  to all you gave is Dems fault. Biden tried everything he could to save Palestine. No, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4454.9s)]
*  that's not true. Biden did not try everything he could to save Palestine. You're just objectively [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4458.98s)]
*  wrong. Okay. I'm sorry. You're just wrong. Biden is the reason why Gaza looks the way it does [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4463.379999999999s)]
*  because all it would have taken for Biden to stop this was one singular phone call and a weapons [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4471.379999999999s)]
*  embargo. He did not want to do it. It was such an easy thing to do that Donald Trump was able to do [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4477.139999999999s)]
*  it without even going in to the office. Okay. Donald Trump did this before he assumed the role [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4484.5s)]
*  of president by sending an envoy as his representative. That was a fucking real estate [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4490.82s)]
*  developer who plays golf with him. Okay. If you think, if you are a progressive person, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4496.82s)]
*  truly on the issues and not simply substituting progressivism by saying you unconditionally [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4503.22s)]
*  defend the democratic party, because many people I think mistake that. Okay. Then you should be able [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4508.66s)]
*  to comprehend what I'm saying here. Okay. Especially if you think I am your enemy. Okay. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4514.42s)]
*  And to be fair, if you do think that like Biden did everything he can to save the Palestinians by [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4522.34s)]
*  what dropping like five nuclear bombs worth of munitions on top of the captured captive civilian [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4528.9800000000005s)]
*  population of Gaza. If you think that that was doing everything you can, then maybe we're not [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4538.02s)]
*  aligned, but if you truly are a progressive person and you think in this moment, this community [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4542.5s)]
*  that will always defend trans people, women's rights, and all marginalized people and, and [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4551.7s)]
*  criticize American foreign policy. If American foreign policy is responsible for the death of [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4560.1s)]
*  and destruction of civilian populations globally, if you think that this community is your enemy and [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4565.14s)]
*  not the much larger, much louder right-wing content creators, I don't know what to tell you. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4570.9s)]
*  This entire space online is dominated by the right, completely dominated by the right. So when [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4579.7s)]
*  people say like Hassan has no dissent, Hassan has no, like Hassan has no competition or dissenting [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4587.94s)]
*  opinions on Twitch, you're delusional. You're just wrong. Asmongold is the largest political [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4596.5s)]
*  content creator on this platform. It's not me. It's Asmongold. He is currently the largest [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4602.82s)]
*  political commentator on the platform and he's right-wing in the field. Don't project or try to [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4610.18s)]
*  indoctrinate. This is not a projection. This is just a mere statement of facts. Okay. There were [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4615.86s)]
*  a lot of people that try to get me deplatformed right before the election. Okay. I'm going to [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4622.1s)]
*  unban this person. There were a lot of people that try to get me deplatformed right before the [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4627.22s)]
*  election. And they specifically did it because you know, they had some petty grievances that [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4630.900000000001s)]
*  their content creators had with me that they wanted to, you know, get a good dunk on. I'm talking about [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4636.740000000001s)]
*  the sex past any community. And what's really interesting about this is that in spite of that, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4643.46s)]
*  even though Twitch did actually respond by blacklisting my stream, we, there was still [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4650.1s)]
*  314,000 people in here watching on the night of the election coverage with 7.5 million [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4656.34s)]
*  viewers over the VOD. And we looked at the numbers and in the top 10 live streamers [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4664.740000000001s)]
*  on election day coverage, I was the only person, I was the only progressive voice [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4671.22s)]
*  in the top 10 really reconsider if I'm your enemy or if someone has basically tried to present [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4677.78s)]
*  things completely out of context to make you feel like I'm your enemy. Anyway, now let's get back to [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4685.78s)]
*  this fresh hell. We love it. We love where we live and we want to stay here. What right does yours have [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4692.34s)]
*  to do this? Well, I think anyone asking that question frankly, doesn't have a realistic view [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4697.94s)]
*  of what's up with sex past any van saying your company about the Philip DeFranco, what company [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4704.099999999999s)]
*  the plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza. I mean, you have literally nearly 2 million people [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4709.7s)]
*  living in a place that has thousands and thousands of unexploded ordinance and bombs. It's, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4718.82s)]
*  it's in some places like a minefield. You have buildings that are collapsing and unsafe. You [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4726.0199999999995s)]
*  have no sewage, no running water. It has become completely unlivable with this war that Hamas [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4731.86s)]
*  started on October 7th. And I, as a veteran can tell you it is despicable and sad that groups like [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4739.94s)]
*  Hamas, Al Qaeda, ISIS literally sacrifice the lives and the livelihoods of their own people to [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4747.0599999999995s)]
*  achieve some type of ideological gain. But I think what the, yeah, yeah, that's what they're doing. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4754.42s)]
*  They're sacrificing the lives of their people in the way of American munitions that Israel is [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4759.46s)]
*  dropping on them. President is just acknowledging as we've been looking at this over the last weeks [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4764.1s)]
*  and months. And frankly, he's been thinking about it since October 7th. And that war is, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4771.38s)]
*  you know, everybody's heart breaks for the Palestinian people across the region. And rightly so, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4776.82s)]
*  but he's not seeing any realistic solutions on how those miles and miles and miles of debris [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4782.900000000001s)]
*  are going to be cleared, how those essentially unexploded bombs are going to be removed, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4790.5s)]
*  how these people are physically going to live for the, at least a decade, if not longer, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4796.42s)]
*  it's going to take to do this. So the fact that nobody has a realistic solution and he puts [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4802.820000000001s)]
*  some very bold, fresh new ideas out on the table, I don't think should be criticized in any way. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4809.38s)]
*  I think it's going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions if they don't like [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4816.42s)]
*  Mr. Trump's solutions. So that's what we saw. And I think that is just living in the common sense, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4822.099999999999s)]
*  practical reality of this awful situation that's going on in Gaza and has been going on some, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4828.58s)]
*  for quite some time. We all, we all agree that it's a terrible, awful situation, but Colonel, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4835.3s)]
*  and I know, but I don't hear a lot of solutions. No, I hear a lot of awful. This is terrible. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4840.5s)]
*  Yeah. There's only one final solution. According to these guys, you know, it's the best solution, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4847.06s)]
*  the final solution. Don't you like that? There is a finality to it. Come on guys. I don't understand. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4852.34s)]
*  Yeah. If you were serious about rebuilding Gaza and leaving it to the Palestinians, you would [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4859.7s)]
*  move the Palestinians into Israel proper. Okay. That's it. Not push them into the fucking Sinai [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4864.9s)]
*  peninsula so they can live in a concentration camp in the desert controlled by an American vassal [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4870.42s)]
*  state. Oh, it is like, and it is, and we, but what Colonel Wolff is, but I don't hear a lot [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4875.139999999999s)]
*  of solutions. Here's my question. Why not help them rebuild as opposed to taking it over and making [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4881.299999999999s)]
*  it the Riviera of the middle East saying, we're going to get rid of Hamas. We're going to help [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4886.9s)]
*  you get rid of Hamas and we're going to help you rebuild as opposed to get out of your land and [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4890.82s)]
*  we're going to take it over and it's going to become a Riviera of the middle East, which sounds [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4894.98s)]
*  like a profit based business. Well, look, I mean, again, it's just back to the, to the kind of [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4899.38s)]
*  common sense of it. When you have 2 million people living on what has become miles of rubble, that's [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4906.42s)]
*  completely unlivable to say we're going to rebuild with them sitting there, I think is incredible. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4913.86s)]
*  Just again, the reality of it is incredibly difficult, but back to your point on Hamas, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4920.42s)]
*  and this is where we have a shared vision and we have shared objectives with the Israeli government. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4925.06s)]
*  Hamas cannot stay there. We would not allow ISIS to continue to attack us on our border. We would [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4932.1s)]
*  not allow another 9-11s. The Israeli government and people deserve to never have another October [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4938.42s)]
*  7th. But what is the Hamas leadership saying right now as we speak, that if they're allowed [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4944.66s)]
*  to survive more October 7th, more attacks, raping, burning and killing of the Israeli people will [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4949.86s)]
*  happen again. So they cannot continue to exist and we're going to support the Israeli government as [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4958.34s)]
*  they defend themselves. Mr. Walz, Colonel Walz, the Israelis are certainly very happy. Benjamin [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4964.34s)]
*  and Yahoo is very happy to have the U.S. support. They're looking for that. But how, from an American [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4969.94s)]
*  perspective, does this make Americans safer? The first concern people will have is, well, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4974.98s)]
*  there's terrorism there. Is there not going to be terrorism here because we're so mixed up in this? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4979.54s)]
*  Well, it's the same, I mean, I think it's the same strategy and thinking of why we still have [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4985.62s)]
*  forces going after ISIS all over the world. We still have allies and partners helping us with [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4991.7s)]
*  Al Qaeda. The president just authorized on Saturday, a strike to a major ISIS financier, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=4998.1s)]
*  recruiter and leader in the caves in Northern Somalia that frankly, our military had been trying [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5005.3s)]
*  to take out for well over a year and couldn't get the approvals. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5012.1s)]
*  Yeah, of course, Tony double, a double SIR came in hot. Mike sir, this guy is supposed to be a [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5016.02s)]
*  liberal sir. What do you think about the blowback and the potential for terrorism in America? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5024.42s)]
*  Also, sir, what do you think about like the, the scariness of Hamas existing in this area still [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5032.02s)]
*  continuously? Don't you think that we should finish the job? Don't you think that we should [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5038.34s)]
*  keep doing permanent genocide? Of course, it is going after ISIS all over the world. We still have [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5044.02s)]
*  allies and partners helping us with Al Qaeda. The president just authorized on Saturday, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5050.26s)]
*  a strike to a major ISIS financier, recruiter and leader in the caves in Northern Somalia that [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5056.900000000001s)]
*  frankly, our military had been trying to take out for well over a year and couldn't get the approvals [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5064.74s)]
*  from the previous White House. So I think what you're asking is why do we support our allies [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5071.46s)]
*  and partners encounter terrorism with a group that is literally promising to conduct future [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5076.42s)]
*  October 7th, which was the 9 11 for, for Israel of their time. So absolutely we're going to continue [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5082.82s)]
*  to help. And when we have terrorism defeated and degraded abroad, it helps the homeland here. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5090.34s)]
*  I hear you there, Mr. Walz, the broader war on terror. That makes sense. Circling back to what [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5096.9s)]
*  Gail was talking about, you know, for generations now, American policy has been in support of a two [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5100.82s)]
*  state solution. Their stability in the middle East will be Israel. And then there'll be a future [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5106.5s)]
*  Palestinian state. Yesterday's comments seem to mean the end of that policy. I just want to clarify, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5110.5s)]
*  is it the end of the two state policy? And are, is it a denial for the future by this government [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5116.5s)]
*  of the wish, the dream of Palestinian? It is pretty crazy because I thought the exit ramp for [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5122.98s)]
*  the Democrats would have always been liberal Zionism, which they didn't even revert to at all. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5128.02s)]
*  And then they lost. And now it's just like straight up ultra Zionism is the position [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5133.3s)]
*  now liberal Zionism and ultra Zionism still obviously has aesthetic differences, but ultimately [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5140.1s)]
*  it's still wants a timeline where the Palestinian state is completely and utterly eradicated. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5145.860000000001s)]
*  Okay. Much like the Democrats who openly say, Oh, well, you know, you voted for Trump, you get what [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5153.78s)]
*  you deserve. I'm calling my neighbors. I'm calling ice on my neighbors who have undocumented [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5160.179999999999s)]
*  immigrants who voted for Trump and their immediate family members that are undocumented. Liberals [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5164.98s)]
*  basically want to maintain the moral high ground while simultaneously enjoying the cruelty that [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5171.379999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is presenting. Because if you truly had a moral position on the matter of [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5176.66s)]
*  deportations being unjustifiable and cruel and unique methods of punishment for people who [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5183.86s)]
*  actually didn't really do any serious crimes whatsoever and are simply existing in American [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5189.0599999999995s)]
*  society and producing and, and, you know, giving significantly more into our tax structure than [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5194.42s)]
*  they actually end up taking out. If you're, if you're not remotely interested in the morality [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5202.58s)]
*  of deportations and simply care about partisanship and team sports on the basis of your team winning [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5211.38s)]
*  and the other team losing, cause you owned the Republicans, then you are by my standards, at least [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5216.9s)]
*  not that different than Republicans. I mean, maybe you're gay or, you know, have immediate queer [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5224.74s)]
*  family members and you're scared. And that's why you wanted the Democrats to win, even though they [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5230.9s)]
*  made really no assurances that they would defend trans people. And as a matter of fact, very quickly [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5234.259999999999s)]
*  turned around and through trans people under the bus, or even through trans people under the bus [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5238.9s)]
*  during the election cycle. And maybe that's like your marginal difference or disagreement with the [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5244.0199999999995s)]
*  Trump side. But overall pure partisanship or the sake of partisanship alone is idiotic, is an idiotic [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5249.0599999999995s)]
*  way to do politics in general. Politics is supposed to be about extracting concessions from [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5258.66s)]
*  your elected representatives. If the democratic party is closer in ideology to the way you see [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5262.82s)]
*  the world, you're supposed to go to them and demand things from them in exchange for your vote, not [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5267.54s)]
*  vice versa, right? It's not the other way around. Votes are earned. They are not entitled to your [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5274.42s)]
*  votes. And no matter how much people do harm reduction arguments and plenty did, and the [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5281.94s)]
*  harm reduction conversation is in theory, correct, right? Because marginal differences between either [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5288.58s)]
*  party still yield, at least put a stay of execution on many people's lives. If it's the democratic [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5295.139999999999s)]
*  party pushing for the same agenda four years later, that still means that for the next four years, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5301.7s)]
*  that stay of execution holds, right? But that's not how people vote. That's not how people operate. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5306.9s)]
*  Even the dumb still understands, even the dumbest voter in America still understands like, well, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5314.74s)]
*  okay, I want some things. I want some things from my representatives. Okay. Even the dumbest person, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5318.98s)]
*  even the dumbest American voter is still self-interested. Okay. And it demonstrably [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5328.0199999999995s)]
*  failed again. Harm reduction arguments with Hillary Clinton failed and harm reduction [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5334.1s)]
*  arguments with Kamala Harris also failed. And Donald Trump became president again, this time [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5339.54s)]
*  after doing January 6th and being president for four years. Okay. So I don't understand why people [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5344.34s)]
*  are so open about their disdain, open about their, their lack of interest in the humanity of people [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5350.42s)]
*  that were victim to the Biden administration's cruel measures. You know, CNN had Democrats on [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5359.38s)]
*  like a week after the election saying the Democrats have gone too wogs, fucking ridiculous. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5366.98s)]
*  Here, I'll tell you another thing that I think tells me at least that people are still looking [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5370.5s)]
*  for some form of obstructionist and resistance against this administration, no matter how hopeless [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5377.0599999999995s)]
*  people feel. Okay. Wired magazine did an article, wired magazine did an article exposing the Doge [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5385.86s)]
*  people that Elon Musk had hired. These are, you know, servants of the public working for [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5396.0199999999995s)]
*  the federal government that are going to have access to all of your data. These are profoundly [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5402.259999999999s)]
*  important individuals and unmasking who they are is definitely for the public good. The notion that [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5406.5s)]
*  these guys should remain hidden and anonymous is ridiculous. But the broader point that I want to [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5412.66s)]
*  make here is that at a time when New York times is losing subscriptions, that the wash at a time [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5417.94s)]
*  when the Washington post has unironically lost, like, basically became a 10th of their previous [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5425.62s)]
*  circulation going from 21 million subscribers to 3 million. When the wired magazine came out with [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5433.46s)]
*  that investigative reporting piece, you know what they noticed a shit ton of subscriptions, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5441.14s)]
*  10 times more subscriptions than they had in that same timeframe previously. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5447.06s)]
*  That to me shows that there is still interest in the public for good journalism. Okay. That means [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5452.34s)]
*  that there is still a lot of appetite for people to say, this is wrong. Can someone please confirm [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5459.22s)]
*  my suspicion? Cause it feels like this is very wrong. Okay. So there are still a lot of people [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5466.34s)]
*  out there who are looking for answers, who are looking for someone to guide them. They just don't [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5474.42s)]
*  know where to go. So especially at a time like this, when people are just trying to fight amongst [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5480.34s)]
*  others, instead of fighting against the Trump administration at a time of unity and solidarity, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5487.46s)]
*  where protecting your neighbors are going to be more important than ever before. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5494.98s)]
*  And I say, this is someone who is not an anarchist. I say, this is someone who has [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5499.7s)]
*  never been a major fan of like decentralized resistance movements at all. As a matter of fact, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5504.259999999999s)]
*  I spent most of my career criticizing this stuff. Okay. I recognize that, you know, this might be [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5508.98s)]
*  the only thing we have at least for the time, for the time being, isn't it kind of easy to see why [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5517.94s)]
*  people are mad at their neighbors. They're fucking mad. They spend years defending illegal [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5523.62s)]
*  immigrants only for a large sum to help them vote for Trump. They feel betrayed. What do you mean? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5526.74s)]
*  That's not allyship in that sort is not transactional. First of all, undocumented [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5530.42s)]
*  migrants can't vote. That's number one. And even if an, here's what you don't, you guys don't [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5533.86s)]
*  understand. This is a fundamental principle that I have, and I hope you guys get this and I hope [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5538.98s)]
*  you abide by the standard as well. Okay. You do not advocate for other people's wellbeing [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5544.74s)]
*  because it's transactional. You do it because it's right. Okay. You do it because you want to [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5553.54s)]
*  improve everyone's lives. Isn't it kind of easy to see why people are mad at their neighbors? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5558.5s)]
*  They're fucking mad. They spent years defending illegal immigrants only for a large sum of them [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5562.1s)]
*  to vote for Trump. They feel betrayed. It's purely emotionally disagree with them, but I know why [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5564.74s)]
*  they're doing it. No, it's ridiculous. Okay. That, that statement, not what you're saying, but [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5568.18s)]
*  that belief is ridiculous. It's ridiculous because why are you defending in your, you know, in your [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5576.1s)]
*  hypothetical liberal argument that you're making, why are these liberals defending illegal immigrants? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5585.22s)]
*  Then is it simply so that, you know, they feel good? Is that what the reason is? But don't you [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5590.26s)]
*  think that's why they're doing it? Yeah, no, I understand that. That's why they're doing it. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5597.3s)]
*  And I'm saying that that is fundamentally flawed. That's fundamentally flawed thinking. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5601.22s)]
*  It's reactionary thinking. Okay. That's my point. And obviously undocumented immigrants can't vote [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5605.62s)]
*  anyway, but even if their immediate family members did vote for Donald Trump, it is ridiculous to say, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5611.14s)]
*  okay, well then fuck them. Does that not make sense? Especially because it betrays the argument [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5616.98s)]
*  that you, that you would be presenting in that situation where it's like, well, I defended you [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5624.34s)]
*  for years. Why did you still go and vote for this person? And it's like, if you defended them for [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5628.26s)]
*  years because of a, a, an interest in helping these people, then why would you cast them aside [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5633.94s)]
*  when they've made the wrong choice in this circumstance and brought about their own cruelty? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5642.259999999999s)]
*  What you're supposed to do is still, okay, what you are supposed to do is still unconditionally [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5648.419999999999s)]
*  try and protect as many people as you possibly can. Not go, eh, fuck it. Does that not make sense? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5655.379999999999s)]
*  Democrats are simply, are simply nothing but a name. And so are Republicans. Okay. They're a [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5662.66s)]
*  collection of values that they demonstrate and a legislative agenda that they follow. It's the [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5669.0599999999995s)]
*  policies that matter, not the name of the party. Okay. All of the history of the party is supposed [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5675.46s)]
*  to help you comprehend what the direction of the party is and what their policies are going to look [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5683.139999999999s)]
*  like and whether they're willing and able to follow through on an agenda that they promise. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5689.94s)]
*  Okay. If in a hypothetical scenario, in an alternative universe, the Republican party [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5696.0199999999995s)]
*  was the pro-immigration party and the Democrats were the anti-immigration party, I'd be voting [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5702.58s)]
*  for the Republican party. It's that simple because it's just a name. Okay. The reason why I hate the [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5706.66s)]
*  Republican party and the reason why I even hate the way that the Democratic party operates and [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5712.66s)]
*  how they present themselves is because of their closeness to the Republican party. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5718.26s)]
*  And the reason why I hate the Republican party is because of the policies and the agenda that they [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5722.74s)]
*  present and follow through on. That's it. It's that simple. It has nothing to do with the aesthetics. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5727.46s)]
*  It has nothing to do with anything but what they are doing. Okay. Because this is not about [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5732.900000000001s)]
*  team sports. This is not about transactional allegiances where, you know, I went out there [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5741.860000000001s)]
*  and I actually protested with BLM. Why are, why is BLM not pro-Israel? Like that's what pro-Israel [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5749.54s)]
*  people say. They'll be like, Oh, well, we did this thing. We went out and did BLM. Why won't, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5755.9400000000005s)]
*  why don't you care about Israel doing a genocide? Like that's ridiculous, right? I mean, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5761.22s)]
*  what did y'all expect over the last eight years? Progressives have alienated and pushed them out [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5766.34s)]
*  vast amounts of young, predominantly white men towards the arms of conservatives. They're [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5769.86s)]
*  argument they're angry about a great many things and conservatives have given them a tangible [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5773.0599999999995s)]
*  visible target for that hate. I mean, I don't think this is progressives and leftists in general. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5777.38s)]
*  I think you are looking at liberal institutions in general and how they communicate. And you're [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5783.219999999999s)]
*  looking at liberals in general and what they care about. And then saying, this is the entirety of [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5789.78s)]
*  the left. My community is mostly comprised of white men chatter. What the fuck are you talking [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5795.78s)]
*  about? You're literally in it. And this is the most visibly leftist community online. And people, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5801.7s)]
*  by the way, those very same people still yell at me all the fucking time, but because there are a [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5807.78s)]
*  lot of key issues that I agree with those rad fems on, for example, or rad libs on, for example, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5812.42s)]
*  I don't mind if they fucking call me like a misogynistic piece of shit. Okay. Because at the [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5818.98s)]
*  end of the day, I still understand. I still welcome you. Okay. You might have disagreements [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5823.7s)]
*  with me. You might think that I am doing the wrong thing or whatever, but at the end of the day, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5827.3s)]
*  when push comes to shove, are you going to defend your neighbors? Are you going to defend people [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5833.54s)]
*  that you don't know that? And in spite of not knowing them at all, you understand that there [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5838.82s)]
*  needs to be an expression of solidarity. There needs to be, there needs to be a collective [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5845.62s)]
*  understanding that these people have the same exact class interests as you. Are you going to [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5850.98s)]
*  be able to show empathy to those who have wronged you? I will. It does not matter what their political [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5855.7s)]
*  ideology is. As long as they recognize right from wrong, as long as they understand that we must do [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5863.299999999999s)]
*  right by others and choose to fight that fight, I will be there by your side. That's it. That is what [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5871.379999999999s)]
*  is important. And that is what is necessary right now more than ever, because our institutions have [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5877.7s)]
*  failed us and they're collapsing in real time. And they're not even necessarily collapsing. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5883.38s)]
*  Necessarily they're, they're being destroyed in real time. They're being picked apart for scraps [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5888.9s)]
*  in real time, in broad daylight. Okay. It's a highway robbery and you're just sitting there [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5894.66s)]
*  and you're watching it every day. And the democratic party that is supposed to be the, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5898.98s)]
*  the counterbalance to this kind of reactionary movement, this kind of reactionary profiteering [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5903.94s)]
*  and endless bloodshed is woefully incompetent. They are not up to the task. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5915.139999999999s)]
*  So it's up to all of you to do what's right in this moment. It's up to all of us. Okay. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5923.219999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5929.14s)]
*  The Asian hood. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5930.14s)]
*  I don't think I did. It certainly didn't hear the president say it was the end of the two [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5933.06s)]
*  state solution. You have the Palestinian authority. You have the West bank. And when he was asked [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5937.9400000000005s)]
*  directly who is going to live there in the future, he said the Palestinians and perhaps [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5944.9800000000005s)]
*  many others. I mean, those are the, I disagree with a metric shit ton of what you say, especially [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5951.06s)]
*  by showing empathy to the opposition, but I still recognize the fact that you're biased. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5955.780000000001s)]
*  And, and though, in my opinion, wrong on your way of trying to make a difference, I do [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5959.14s)]
*  acknowledge the fact that you're a liberal reactionary who has my same goals in mind [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5962.26s)]
*  with just different ways to get to the solution. A liberal reactionary [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5966.02s)]
*  conversations that we're having the president has talked to president CC of Egypt. He's talked to [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5970.26s)]
*  Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince, every, every liberal on the internet currently is [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5976.02s)]
*  a screaming about how, how much of a radical terrorist lover I am for being pro-Palestine [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5983.14s)]
*  uncompromisingly. And there's still people in here that are like, well, you are a reactionary [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5990.740000000001s)]
*  liberal. No, you can be liberals are reactionary in many instances. That person is just like [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=5995.54s)]
*  far to that person is max left. Okay. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6002.66s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. He has spoken of course, to King Abdullah, who's coming here next week. We have [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6006.18s)]
*  prime minister Netanyahu here now. So the president is engaging with our key allies [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6013.7s)]
*  in the region and asking for their input, asking for their ideas and is personally engaged on this [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6019.78s)]
*  issue. Colonel Waltz last question. And we'll let you go. Does it matter that the Palestinian people [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6026.18s)]
*  may not want this? They want their land and they do not want to move. Does it matter to [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6034.42s)]
*  president Trump? Does it matter to this administration? Oh, well, of course it does. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6038.58s)]
*  But you know, that's the difference in logistics. It does because if they don't want to leave, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6046.339999999999s)]
*  then we're going to have to apply more pressure. It's about how many guns we use in the process of [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6053.86s)]
*  ethnic cleansing and mass displacement. Do you understand? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6059.86s)]
*  Pete, I think one of the key points the president, president Trump made last night was [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6064.5s)]
*  tell me what real better alternatives they've ever been offered. If you're literally on the brink of [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6069.46s)]
*  starvation, if you can't get clean water, you have no sewage, your home bro. These people were not [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6076.9s)]
*  allowed to leave when they were being bombed. Okay. These people were not allowed to leave when [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6083.139999999999s)]
*  they were being bombed. So it wasn't dangerous enough when it was raining munitions on them, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6088.1s)]
*  but it's dangerous in the rebuilding process. Give me a fucking break. It's just [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6093.38s)]
*  bullshit. What's left of it is about to collapse on your family. And you're offered some type of [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6097.3s)]
*  viable solution to live in peace and have a better future to not have bombs and bullets flying, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6103.38s)]
*  to not have Hamas lining the windows. And yeah, this is, this is a joke, but this basically is [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6110.1s)]
*  a summarization of a lot of what liberals are saying right now. Like way to go left is now [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6117.78s)]
*  Trump's going to level this place, you know, walls with human shields, Israeli soldiers. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6122.42s)]
*  How about negotiating? That seems like a better, well, that's absolutely the president's [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6129.78s)]
*  middle East envoy, despite a lot of people saying it couldn't be done, actually helped [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6136.5s)]
*  negotiate the previous administration, negotiate the current ceasefire that we're in. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6142.82s)]
*  And those negotiations are ongoing and we have hostages being reunited to tears of joy all over [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6148.099999999999s)]
*  Israel. So let's not, let's not forget that we literally have murals of president Trump hanging [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6155.54s)]
*  in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem right now, thanking him for the live hostages that are coming out. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6161.139999999999s)]
*  Mr. Waltz, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back. Thank you. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6168.74s)]
*  For me, I didn't really saw that as a super serious kind of a situation. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6172.82s)]
*  Great. The smartest guy is up to the task. The number one advocate. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_9rOaK7LI&t=6176.179999999999s)]
