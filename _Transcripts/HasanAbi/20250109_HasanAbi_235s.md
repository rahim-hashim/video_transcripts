# Kaya Fell In Love With An Animated Cat | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8)
*  What is going on? I've never seen her like this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh my god, she is transfixed by the cat. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=3.0s)]
*  She's locked in. It's crazy. That's so cool. My dog never watched TV. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=8.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was, it was... [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=13.0s)]
*  What did you think of Flo? I fell asleep. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=19.0s)]
*  We turned on Flo last night to watch. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=21.0s)]
*  We went to Trader Joe's. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=25.0s)]
*  We got some frozen pizzas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=28.0s)]
*  And we did a little sleepover. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=30.0s)]
*  And we watched a movie. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=32.0s)]
*  And we turned on, the movie we watched was Flo. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=34.0s)]
*  And I've never seen Kaia behave like this. Yo, check this out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=37.0s)]
*  Like, she sometimes watches the TV. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=40.0s)]
*  It's normal. She sometimes watches the TV. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=43.0s)]
*  Depending on what's on the TV. Especially if there's like birds or animals and stuff. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=46.0s)]
*  But I've never not stopped. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=51.0s)]
*  She literally got up close to watch it. Look. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=53.0s)]
*  Oh my god, she looks so good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=57.0s)]
*  She doesn't want to be distracted. Look at that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=59.0s)]
*  What is going on? I've never seen her like this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=61.0s)]
*  Oh my god, she is transfixed by the cat. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=63.0s)]
*  She's locked in. It's crazy. That's so cool. My dog never watched TV. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=68.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was, it was weird. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=72.0s)]
*  But also, I guess a lot of your cats watch me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=75.0s)]
*  So, my mom was really excited. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=79.0s)]
*  Because she's like, she always puts on like dog anxiety YouTube videos. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=82.0s)]
*  Whenever, whenever I'm away. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=88.0s)]
*  And Kaia doesn't really vibe with that that much. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=91.0s)]
*  But she's like, oh, I finally found something I can play when, when you're gone. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=93.0s)]
*  That she is actually locked in on. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=98.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=101.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=105.0s)]
*  Oh, and was a very perceptive. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=112.0s)]
*  I had a guinea pig once that was sitting by the balcony door facing the room and watched TV with my dad. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=120.0s)]
*  That's crazy. I doubt it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=124.0s)]
*  How was the movie? I don't know. I went upstairs to go to sleep. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=126.0s)]
*  I had to, I had to wake up early. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=129.0s)]
*  And then from the, from 8 a.m. until like literally 12, I was getting worked on. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=131.0s)]
*  I was at the dentist. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=137.0s)]
*  And that's why I'm a little low energy right now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=139.0s)]
*  And also in a little bit of pain, I'll admit it's like not annoying. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=142.0s)]
*  Like it's not terrible pain. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=147.0s)]
*  It's not gnawing pain, but it's like annoying. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=148.0s)]
*  Like a, like a nuisance, almost itchy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=151.0s)]
*  If that makes sense. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=155.0s)]
*  And it's very, very like, I know I have a short fuse. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=156.0s)]
*  You want to know why I know I have a short fuse? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=159.0s)]
*  Because while I was showering, I was listening to Vox talking about the TikTok band and how awesome it is and how constitutional it is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=162.0s)]
*  And how also the American government should ban many more Chinese products. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=169.0s)]
*  And I got so like, I got so mad. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=173.0s)]
*  I got so mad. I almost threw my phone away, like unreasonably mad. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=177.0s)]
*  And like normally, oh yeah, I listened to, you know, reporters say dumb shit that defends American interests on a regular basis. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=182.0s)]
*  But like my reaction was not normal is what I'm saying. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=191.0s)]
*  Especially when she said something along the lines of like, yeah, well, it's more so just about market dominance, really just straight up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=195.0s)]
*  Like, oh yeah, America, like they openly admitted the products are better and they're cheaper and America can't compete. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=202.0s)]
*  So they should have to ban it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=208.0s)]
*  Another reason why you're better off without TRT. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=209.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=212.0s)]
*  Farley's worst nightmare having to spend time. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=213.0s)]
*  Kaia. Yeah. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=215.0s)]
*  He just mad as hell the whole time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=216.0s)]
*  Just borking, just freaking borking nonstop, dude. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=218.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=223.0s)]
*  If they come for rivals, bro, they will come for League, Valorant, Rivals, anything that Tencent's owned. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=224.0s)]
*  Like they will come for it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=230.0s)]
*  It's really annoying. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXDbVBpAgM8&t=232.0s)]
