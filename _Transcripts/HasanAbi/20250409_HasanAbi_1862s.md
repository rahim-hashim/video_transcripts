# Trump Announces 90-day Tariff Pause | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ)
*  That is literally the closest that the American government has arrived at his vision of rebuilding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a robust manufacturing base, at least for chip manufacturing. What do you mean? This part is so [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=6.96s)]
*  crazy because the Chips Act doesn't go far enough. It doesn't go far enough. It's limited still [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=14.96s)]
*  because of the capitalist dogma. Donald Trump thinks that capital owners will magically arrive [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=21.36s)]
*  at this conclusion on their own because they've been bullied into into doing this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=27.6s)]
*  He's live right now. They went for like a year and a half, almost two years [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=36.24s)]
*  screaming and ranting and raving. That's too worse than Democrats. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=40.32s)]
*  You had Cheney, Liz Cheney and crying. In the long term, wouldn't terrorist against China be a good [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  thing for America to reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturing and working towards building [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=51.6s)]
*  our manufacturing base? No, because the problem is not building our manufacturing base. If you build [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=54.56s)]
*  your manufacturing base and then either depress labor, depress wages as we have consistently at [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  the behest of capital, or even fucking fully automate that process, then the same income [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=66.16s)]
*  inequality will persist. You're not actually helping the American population in that regard. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=71.04s)]
*  You're just simply trying to extend and give a lifeline to American dominance. And also, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  this process in and of itself cannot be done with a private public partnership anyway. You can't just [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=84.56s)]
*  expect capital to come back into the United States of America and build a robust manufacturing base [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=89.28s)]
*  without the infrastructure projects necessary to build said robust manufacturing base. That would [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=93.84s)]
*  require an unimaginable amount of money. They found out that Pelosi was the one that was in charge of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=99.04s)]
*  the security of the capital. She knew all about it. And she admitted her guilt to her daughter, who was [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=106.56s)]
*  a movie documentary person. I'm sure her daughter's not too happy about that. I'm sure crazy Nancy's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=110.8s)]
*  not too happy, but we found out all the things, everything. And we go for the information. Sir, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=118.96s)]
*  we've destroyed all of that information. If I haven't destroyed it, I wouldn't be sitting here [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=123.6s)]
*  right now. I guarantee you that I'd be sitting someplace else. So I think it's something that we [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=128.16s)]
*  should do. Richard Whitmer is in this room, by the way. The whole concept of an auto pen, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=132.96s)]
*  because whoever who was, you know, auto pens are run by somebody, whoever ran the auto pen was [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=138.16s)]
*  president of the United States. And I would be willing to bet that Biden didn't know. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. He didn't know anything about any of it. Oh my God. He's still on the auto pen. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=148.72s)]
*  So you're going to check that out, right? Yes, sir. This is just another proclamation, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  sir. Declaring national crime. So do you just like wish for the downfall of the United States [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=162.64s)]
*  everything you're saying right now is pure doomerism? What do you want me to do? Lie to you? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=167.28s)]
*  What a stupid expectation from you chatter. Hey man, can you please just say that Donald [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=172.32s)]
*  Trump's insane moves are actually for the greater good and make me feel good about the situation? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes, dude. 10% tariffs that you will pay for globally plus severing ties with our largest [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=186.4s)]
*  trading partner is a good thing. Okay. Yeah, I will make it make sense for you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=194.48s)]
*  What the fuck is this expectation? People are so stupid, man. Open, strong, thriving. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=202.48s)]
*  And I think we're going to be successful governor. I think we'll be very successful that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=209.04s)]
*  we're getting some good feedback from Pete Hicks, and the Department of Defense. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  Can you please lie to me? Yeah, go watch Asmongold if you want someone to say, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=218.0s)]
*  bust over Donald Trump's idiotic decisions. Okay. Like plenty of people do choose that route [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=222.8s)]
*  where they're like, I just want someone to whisper sweet nothings into my ear. You know what I mean? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  And act like all of these decisions are actually very good and will make my western chauvinist [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=233.52s)]
*  perspective emboldened. Make me feel emboldened about American enterprise. Hell yeah, it's going [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  to happen. First of all, you'll come back when you realize perhaps all of that was a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=246.64s)]
*  house of cards built upon a pile of shit. It'll be critical to Michigan's economy and our security [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=253.92s)]
*  when you're able to deliver us. Mills the chef, they give us a 50 bones. But on the Asian Carp, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=261.36s)]
*  for years when Obama was there, we could never get anyone to do anything about this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=266.08s)]
*  invasive species. It's going to destroy our Great Lakes. You know how important recreational fishing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=272.0s)]
*  and so much of that is to our state. Because of your work, we're hopeful that we'll get a solution [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=277.6s)]
*  there and we'll get that barrier built so we can protect our Great Lakes. So thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=286.16s)]
*  And they're very powerful fish. I mean, I assume they jump out of the water, they jump at the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  fishermen. I mean, I've never seen anything like it. Has this gotten into any of the other lakes yet? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=296.08s)]
*  Because you would think it would be pretty easy because they're all sort of connected. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=301.52s)]
*  It's why we're working so hard to make sure that we work with the Army Corps and erect a barrier so [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=305.52s)]
*  that the Asian Carp can't get into Lake Michigan. It'll devastate the ecosystem, the economy. And [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=311.36s)]
*  it's 20% of the world's fresh waters in the Great Lakes, Mr. President, which is why it's so important [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=316.72s)]
*  that as a nation we protect the very powerful fish. The greatest fish. It will make the sushi [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=321.2s)]
*  with the fish. I love the fish. I want to kiss the fishies. And so we're going to work hard on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=330.4s)]
*  that. I spoke with the Army Corps of Engineers and they have a method. It's a pretty gruesome [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=337.2s)]
*  method, but it's a method. I've underfunded the Army Corps of Engineers, but even with the limited [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  funding and the layoffs, they'll be able to kiss the fish. It's a very expensive thing, actually. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=348.56s)]
*  Costs a lot. I looked at the numbers. I said, well, but we have to save Lake Michigan because these [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=354.88s)]
*  fish, they eat everything in the way, including the other fish. They eat everything. Are people [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=361.36s)]
*  endangered by the fish? I think it's, I mean, they're going to eat all the fish there. We [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=366.56s)]
*  won't be able to fish anymore. And that's a big deal in Lake Michigan. There's a lot of fishing, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=371.52s)]
*  recreation. So it's going to be a problem there. But you're right. It's bipartisan, sir. But you're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=375.68s)]
*  the one taking action on these issues. We couldn't get Biden to do it on Selfridge. This thing has [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=381.68s)]
*  been delayed for, what, 15 years where we were trying to do it. It started under Obama where we [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=386.56s)]
*  were trying to do it. He wouldn't do anything about it. So we appreciate you paying so much attention [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=391.44s)]
*  to this and taking action, sir. And the governor, in all fairness, called me about it. I had seen it [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=396.24s)]
*  and she called me and John James called me. And we spoke with your office and it's, you know, I want [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=401.44s)]
*  to put that down really as bipartisan. It's, it's great to see it actually. It's great to see that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=408.8s)]
*  And that includes Selfridge too. And we're going to get it done and we're going to, we'll all stand [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=413.92s)]
*  there together and cut a ribbon. Okay. Gretchen. Good. Thank you very much. It's, I'm glad you brought [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=419.68s)]
*  it up. Yeah. He hates the California fish, but the Michigan fish he loves, and he will preserve [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=426.0s)]
*  the Michigan fish. Understand something. I will do everything in my power to kill the smelt. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=430.4s)]
*  The Californian Delta will cry. The smelt will cry. I hate that fish, but the Michigan fish, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=438.64s)]
*  very important fish to me. Very powerful fish in Michigan. Where does the TikTok deal stand, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=445.76s)]
*  given what we've seen, you know, the tariffs in China? Obviously, I would say right now, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=450.88s)]
*  China's not exactly thrilled about signing it. We have a deal with some very good people, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=455.12s)]
*  some very rich companies that would do a great job with it, but we're going to have to wait to see [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=460.48s)]
*  what, what's going to happen with China. So I think China's going to want to do it actually. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=466.0s)]
*  What you believe is the end game with China. Are you waiting for president Xi to blink? How do you [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=476.8s)]
*  think this is all going to be resolved? Look, for years we've been ripped off and taken advantage [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=481.6s)]
*  of by China and others, in all fairness, but by China, that's the big one. And it's just one of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  those things. You know, we're making $2 billion a day right now, this country. $2 billion a day with [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=494.8s)]
*  tariffs. And they were making $2 billion a day. We'll be making more. Now when you see what happened [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=501.12s)]
*  today, I don't know if it's still there. You know, this was, I looked an hour ago, but [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=508.16s)]
*  we're up like close to 3000 points. Nobody's ever seen a day like that. I think that's a record. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=512.64s)]
*  Isn't it? Is that a record? Who would have thought we're going to have a record like that [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=517.44s)]
*  after watching? But because the geniuses of the world. I like that he's like collecting little [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=522.96s)]
*  trophies. He's got the FIFA trophy. He's got the Gulf of America behind him. Every time he does like [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=530.24s)]
*  some aesthetic move that is undeniable, like even if it's inconsequential overall, he will just like [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=535.04s)]
*  present it as though, you know, this is a beautiful thing I did. Look at this beautiful thing. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  But the people that do this for a living, some of them are very smart and some of them [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=547.36s)]
*  aren't smart at all. But these guys are very smart. And my group is very smart. My whole group is [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=551.36s)]
*  smart. And you've done so amazing on the board. I read the other day that there were nine people [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=557.12s)]
*  and hundreds of thousands two years ago with Biden and we had nine. We had it down to nine and they [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=563.6s)]
*  were all let in for medical reasons. They were in bad shape. We let them in for medical reasons, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  not even for anything else. So you've been amazing. But that's a big thing. I think it's one of the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=574.88s)]
*  greatest, one of the greatest problems that I've never seen anything like it. Open borders. The [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=579.84s)]
*  whole world was emptied out. Prisons from all over the world, from the Congo, in Africa, from [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=587.6s)]
*  Africa to Asia, a lot in South America, but it wasn't just South America. And I said it outside [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=593.2s)]
*  with the drivers before, but El Salvador has been amazing, a job that the president has done. He's [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=600.48s)]
*  coming to see me next week and we look forward to that. But that's really been amazing. Yes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, the EU also announced increases in terrorists today. Why not? Shreya had timing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=613.04s)]
*  for them. That's bad timing. Why not? They didn't put them in. No, they threatened them, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=620.64s)]
*  but they picked a later date, which our expectation is it's going to be later still. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=625.76s)]
*  Okay. I'm glad that they held back. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  As you know, this was the strategy all along to bring them to the table. Why did you instruct or [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=633.52s)]
*  advise or maybe they did it on their own, some of your top aides to say this is not a negotiation to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=642.8s)]
*  hold the line that they were going to hold the line that you were not going to change? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  A lot of times it's not a negotiation until it is. And that happens. And, you know, I said outside [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=652.56s)]
*  that you have the flexibility to do it right. And that's what we have. We brought everybody to the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=658.4s)]
*  table and it may not be a negotiation. It may not last. I mean, you know, things may be as that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=663.36s)]
*  I think are not fair to us. Look, we've been ripped off by [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=669.36s)]
*  essentially everybody for 35 years. This is not just a new thing. And Roger Penske just left. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=674.24s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, great man, actually. And he said no other president would have had the guts [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=680.64s)]
*  to do this. And I believe that's right. He wouldn't have done. They should have done this a long time [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=685.36s)]
*  ago. A long time ago, they should have done. I started it with China. I took in hundreds of [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=689.2s)]
*  billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from China in my first term. And we had the greatest [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=694.24s)]
*  economy. We were up 88 percent on the stock market. That was the greatest ever in the history of our [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=699.44s)]
*  country. But it had to be done. It's something that had to be done. Mr. President, thank you so much. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=704.32s)]
*  Which countries will be negotiating first? Do you have any criteria? Because, for example, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=713.52s)]
*  Brazil and the UK, they do not have deficits with the US. They have a surplus. They do not have a [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=718.72s)]
*  surplus. They have deficits with the US. So what is the criteria? And also, would you consider [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=723.52s)]
*  talking or meeting with Xi Jinping? Oh, sure. He's a friend of mine. I like him. President Xi. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=729.84s)]
*  I like him. I respect him. But call me. Why won't she call me? She needs to call me on my cell phone. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=737.28s)]

*  to make a deal, actually. And, you know, we want to do what's right for our country. We also want [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=759.12s)]
*  to do what's right for the world. The world is important. I mean, it's the world, right? And [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=764.4s)]
*  I think we're going to make a lot of people very happy. And I think investing in the United States [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=770.48s)]
*  of America will be the greatest investment that anybody's ever made. Mr. President, can we [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=775.12s)]
*  still expect to see the sectoral tariffs, so the pharmaceuticals, steal? Is that something you're [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=779.68s)]
*  still considering moving forward? Yeah, well, I will be because we want them coming back. You [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=784.16s)]
*  know, we realized during the COVID that we don't make our drugs and our pharmaceuticals in this [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=788.4s)]
*  country. So I realized that. And it was a big realization. We had to go to China to get drugs. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=794.64s)]
*  We had to go to other places. I won't even mention the names, but we had to go to other places. We [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=802.56s)]
*  don't make it. And that's because we let them leave. And now if they want to come back, we're [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=807.68s)]
*  going to put tariffs on the pharmaceutical companies and they're going to want to come back. They're [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=812.88s)]
*  going to come back. I'm not going to pay them any money like Biden with the chip deal. That chip [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=817.84s)]
*  deal was horrible. They give billions and billions of dollars to chip companies. All they have is [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  money. They have so much money and they give billions of dollars. Dude, dude, how, what is [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=826.4s)]
*  the expectation? That is literally the closest that the American government has arrived at his [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=832.0s)]
*  vision of rebuilding a robust manufacturing base, at least for chip manufacturing. What do you, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=839.52s)]
*  what do you mean? This part is so crazy because like the Chips Act doesn't go far enough. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. It doesn't go far enough. It's limited still because of the capitalist dogma. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=852.64s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks that capital owners will magically arrive at this conclusion on their own [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=857.9200000000001s)]
*  because they've been bullied into doing this. The Chips Act in and of itself does not go far enough [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=863.12s)]
*  to build American manufacturing. This fucking dumbass thinks he's going to have it happen [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=873.1999999999999s)]
*  magically. You've secured a record amount of private sector investments since your election, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=879.68s)]
*  $7 trillion. You talked about the importance of all that. Can you talk about how these investments [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=885.28s)]
*  will have a positive impact on families who felt like the previous economy left them behind and [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  why your executive orders on coal yesterday is so important given the amount of manufacturing that [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=897.1199999999999s)]
*  you're ushering back in? Thank you. And which is correct. We have, I would say more than $7 trillion [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=902.24s)]
*  now, right? Of investment coming in. Apple is coming in for 500 billion alone. We have other [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=909.6s)]
*  companies coming in with massive numbers. We have car companies that are coming in. No, we've never [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  seen anything like it. Maybe in the 1940s or 50s or something, but we've never seen anything like [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=921.76s)]
*  it. They had three plants canceled in Mexico. Not that we want to hurt Mexico, but we're for [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=926.4s)]
*  us. And that's what my job is. It's not to take care of other countries, but I want to help other [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=933.04s)]
*  countries as much as I can, but we have to take care of America first. And it's about America first. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=939.1999999999999s)]
*  So we have many, many companies coming in that would have never come in if we didn't win the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  election and then put the tariffs on. And they're coming in because when they build in the United [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=948.8s)]
*  States, there are no tariffs. You don't have to pay any tariffs. So instead of paying 30, 40, 50 [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=955.44s)]
*  percent or 25 percent, but it could go a lot higher in some of the industries. So we have steel mills [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=960.24s)]
*  right now that are raging. The steel industry has gone. If I didn't put the tariffs on steel, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=967.12s)]
*  because China was dumping massive amounts of steel in my first term, and I put tariffs on it, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=972.8000000000001s)]
*  I saved the steel industry. But now it's going to thrive, maybe like never before. I mean, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=977.12s)]
*  if you go back to U.S. Steel from 90 years ago, it's incredible. It's the number one company in [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=982.64s)]
*  the world for a long time. That's why we don't want to see it go to Japan. And we love Japan, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=986.88s)]
*  but we, you know, U.S. Steel is a very special company. We don't want it to go to Japan or any [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=992.08s)]
*  other place. So we're working with them. And, you know, I don't know if they need any money now. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=998.48s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. They're, they hit gold. They hit gold because if you look at it, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1002.96s)]
*  they have such orders for steel now. It's incredible. What's going on is, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  what's going on in our country is incredible with respect to plants. So we lost 90,000 plants [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1013.84s)]
*  and factories from the beginning of NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made in the history of this [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1022.0s)]
*  world, but certainly in the history of trade. There's never been a worst trade deal. We were [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1027.28s)]
*  able to cancel that. We had to get approval from Congress. It was a, it was like, it was like a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1032.0s)]
*  disastrous curse because you, you know, you had to go to Congress to get it terminated. You couldn't [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1036.48s)]
*  just terminate it because it was a bad deal. And you had people in Congress that didn't want to do [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1042.16s)]
*  it because they had other reasons, maybe bad reasons. They're mostly not there anymore, those [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1046.56s)]
*  people. But it's amazing what's happened. I appreciate that question because it's incredible. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1051.68s)]
*  I don't think we've ever seen anything like it. Seven trillion dollars, and it's much more than [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1057.84s)]
*  that because, you know, these are places that we know. Seven trillion dollars is unheard of. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1062.72s)]
*  I never looked at the Biden numbers, but you could go a whole year and it was, it was peanuts. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1069.28s)]
*  People, everybody was leaving. They weren't coming in. They were leaving. And that means jobs are [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1075.52s)]
*  leaving. And so we're not, we're not playing games. We're going to make this country greater than ever [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1079.44s)]
*  before. Thank you for that question. Mr. President, it seems that John has taken me. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1085.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. Thanks. For the past few days, we've heard from this administration, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1091.12s)]
*  no pause. Was this idea of doing a pause, did that just come about this morning? Can you [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1095.28s)]
*  tell us exactly what came into consideration for you and your advisors? For a period of time, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't say this morning. Over the last few days, I've been thinking about it. I've been [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1105.4399999999998s)]
*  dealing with Scott, with Howard, with some other people that are very professional. And I think it [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1108.56s)]
*  probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning. Just wrote it up. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1116.16s)]
*  I didn't, we didn't have the use of, we didn't have access to lawyers or we just wrote it up. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1121.8400000000001s)]
*  We wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart. Let's see what the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1127.6000000000001s)]
*  Asmik Goldians are saying. It was written from the heart. It was written as something that I [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1132.48s)]
*  think was very positive for the world and for us. And we don't want to hurt countries that [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1137.8400000000001s)]
*  don't need to be hurt. And they all want to negotiate. The only problem is, you know, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1144.24s)]
*  you can only do so many at one time. It's like, it's, we want to do it right. We want to get it [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  right. We want to take care of them, but we have to take care of our country. So, but this was [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1153.76s)]
*  something certainly we've been talking about for a period of time. And we decided to pull the trigger [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1159.04s)]
*  and we're happy about it. I didn't know we'd have that kind of impact. Okay. So they're, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1166.16s)]
*  they're also not necessarily on board, it seems. So that's good. You're almost, you know, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1172.16s)]
*  if you keep going, you're going to be back to where it was four weeks ago. But it was a sick [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1177.04s)]
*  market four weeks ago, you know, because this trade was sick. It was only a question of time. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1182.32s)]
*  I don't blame the tariffs. I think the tariffs just sort of magnified what was happening. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1186.64s)]
*  It was, it was sick. Biden allowed these people to get away with murder. Biden allowed [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1193.44s)]
*  China to just take advantage of us. We had like a trillion dollar deficit. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1198.32s)]
*  How does China trillion dollar deficit? How does that? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1202.08s)]
*  Instantly know when I'm watching as many goals chat, by the way, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1206.8s)]
*  do they just have both of our fucking chats open at the same time? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1210.3999999999999s)]

*  Yes, sir. Please. Thank you, Mr. President. So it seems China has made some serious missteps here in [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1220.3999999999999s)]

*  in terms of trade? No, no, China. Look, they're very capable. And I don't blame China for what [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1237.92s)]

*  it. Look at our inner cities. Look at what's happened. I think we're starting from ground zero [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1288.9599999999998s)]
*  there, right? So we're a developing nation, too. No, I don't I know it's a lot of people take heat [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1294.08s)]
*  for saying it, but I blame the people sitting at this desk more than I blame China. If China can get [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1300.56s)]

*  but they certainly weren't courageous and they allowed this to happen and with Japan and with [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1323.04s)]
*  many other countries that took advantage of us. We had deficits with almost every country. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1328.0s)]
*  I used to read these things first term. I'd read them. I'd actually read the agreements. I'd say, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1334.96s)]
*  how could anybody agree to this stuff? So certainly they were rough and they were tough and they were [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1339.04s)]
*  smart and you can blame them, but I really blame the people that allowed them to do it because, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1347.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, you if you could read first grade and you could read these agreements, you'd say [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1353.3600000000001s)]
*  these are terrible deals. I actually used to say who would allow deals like this to be made for [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1358.48s)]
*  a country and maybe it's people that didn't care. Maybe it's people that weren't courageous. Maybe [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1364.16s)]
*  it's people that were corrupt. I don't know, but I blame those people more than I blame anybody else. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1370.88s)]
*  Mr. President, you've been very specific in saying that you would like the EU to purchase [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1380.4s)]
*  you. There's definitely a lot more discontent says the dude who told us the NJ [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1385.1200000000001s)]
*  for Trump can't read it first grade. There's a lot of a lot of discontent seemingly in the [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1389.44s)]
*  gold inside. I'll be telling China what that is. I don't think they are buying whatever the fuck [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1397.2s)]
*  Trump is selling at this moment. They do not agree to a potential nuclear deal that it would be very [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1403.2s)]
*  dangerous for them. What specifically did you mean? Did you mean military action though if they don't [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1409.3600000000001s)]
*  agree? Oh if necessary? Absolutely. Yeah. Do you have a deadline for these talks? Yeah I do. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1414.08s)]
*  You're talking about with Iran? Yes. Yeah I do. Do you have something definitive this weekend or do [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1422.3999999999999s)]
*  you see this as a start of a process? It's a start. Do you have a timeline? We have a little time but [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1427.6s)]
*  we don't have much time because we're not going to let them have a nuclear weapon. We can't let [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1431.9199999999998s)]
*  them have a nuclear weapon. And we're going to let them thrive. I want them to thrive. I want Iran to be [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1436.48s)]
*  great. The only thing they can't have is a nuclear weapon. They understand that. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1441.2s)]
*  You know the people are so incredible in Iran and they're so smart. They're very smart people [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1446.88s)]
*  and you know they're in a rough situation, rough regime. But they understand and the leaders [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1452.48s)]
*  understand. And I'm not asking for much. They can't have a nuclear weapon and I've said that [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1460.16s)]
*  and I was a little bit surprised because when the election was rigged I figured they'd get their [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1467.6s)]
*  weapon because with me they were broke. They were broke. They had no money because of the sanctions. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1473.36s)]
*  Nobody could buy oil. We did that to Venezuela just recently and we'll do it to other countries if we have to. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1478.8799999999999s)]
*  I want to see Russia and Ukraine make a deal. They got to make a deal. When schools get blown [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1486.24s)]
*  up and bad things happen like I'm hearing about, it's no good. I hope we're going to make a deal [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1493.44s)]
*  with Russia and Ukraine. But with Iran, yeah, if it requires military, we're going to have military. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1499.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel will obviously be very much involved in that. He'll be the leader of that. But nobody leads [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1507.44s)]
*  us. We do what we want to do. When would the talks need to conclude before you might do military? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1514.3200000000002s)]
*  I can't really be specific but you know when you start talks you know if they're going along well [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1522.8s)]
*  or not and I would say the conclusion would be when I think they're not going along well. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1527.2s)]
*  So that's just a feeling. Mr. President, on the subject of US troops stationed in Europe, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1532.3999999999999s)]
*  do you have any plans to reduce the number of US troops in Europe or in other NATO countries? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1537.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, good. I mean it depends. We pay for military over in Europe. You know, we don't get [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1543.36s)]
*  reimbursed by much. South Korea too. So it would be one of the things we discussed. That's unrelated [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1549.68s)]
*  to trade but I think we'll make it part of it because it makes sense. It'd be nice to wrap it [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1556.48s)]
*  all up in one package for each country. You know, it's nice and clean and we have plenty of law [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1561.52s)]
*  firms. These are great law firms that we signed with. The best. And I think part of the way I'll [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1566.0s)]
*  spend some of the money that we're getting from the law firms, you know, in terms of their legal [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1572.0800000000002s)]
*  time. If you don't understand how Trump thinks about this, you should check out Peter Navarro. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1576.8s)]
*  Dude, I check out Peter Navarro. Don't worry. Good lawyers representing us but we want to have good [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1580.48s)]
*  lawyers and these are considered the best lawyers in the world, right? I mean considered the best [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1585.04s)]
*  in the world. I don't know. They just went off a little bit. Mr. President, two questions. Don't [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1590.1599999999999s)]
*  we run? Do you have an update on who will be participating or conducting these conversations? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1595.28s)]
*  We will be there on Saturday for these direct talks. And on China, some economists are saying [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1600.08s)]
*  that right now is technically an embargo on China with 125 percent tariffs. Are you concerned of [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1607.84s)]
*  escalation beyond the trade war with China? No, I'm not concerned. I think President Xi is a very [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1614.8s)]
*  smart guy and I think we'll end up making a very good deal for both. But you know, we've been [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1620.88s)]
*  treated so badly for so many years. Again, we allowed that to happen. We've been treated so [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1627.92s)]
*  badly for so many years. But no, I don't expect that. I think President Xi is one of the very [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1634.0800000000002s)]
*  smart people of the world and I don't think he'd allow that to happen. And we're very powerful. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1639.28s)]
*  This country is very powerful. Let me tell you, this farm is powerful. My favorite advisor, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1646.48s)]
*  brilliant guy, knows China. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1653.68s)]
*  Were you planning to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1683.68s)]
*  People every single week, think of that, 2500 people a week. It's not even conceivable. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1713.92s)]
*  We got to get there fast. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1721.44s)]
*  I can't imagine it. No, we can't imagine. I don't think I'll have to do it. I don't think we'll [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1729.68s)]
*  have to do it more. You know, we calculated it very carefully. By the way, you know, when you [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1735.76s)]
*  hear 100, a lot of people charge much more than that. Canada charges much more than that to our [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1740.8s)]
*  farmers, our dairy farmers. Many, many people charge much more than 100 or 125 in this case. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1748.08s)]
*  But I don't, you know, it's still a significant number. I don't see, no, I don't see that. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1756.32s)]
*  So do you think some of your chair of critics would prefer, you know, to see the United States [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1763.9199999999998s)]
*  go through turmoil than to actually see it succeed just because they are fewer policies? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1771.12s)]
*  You mean just leave the tariffs away right now and just relax? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1776.6399999999999s)]
*  He's just like, he, I think he just loves Xi. And he's willing to make the American small business [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1779.84s)]
*  owners that rely on, that rely on Chinese manufacturing and the American working class that [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1788.08s)]
*  has benefited from the cheap, accessible, affordable commodities suffer with mass inflation [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1795.44s)]
*  just to get Xi to call him, you know, on a cell phone. He's like, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1805.52s)]
*  Resident Xi, he loves me. I know he loves me. He just doesn't want to call. He's playing hard to get. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1808.64s)]
*  I've been in worse positions in my life than making $2 billion a day. Plus plus, right? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1813.8400000000001s)]
*  He's just playing hard to get. Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1818.16s)]
*  Thank you, press. Thank you, press. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1820.72s)]
*  Believe it. Believe it. I will destroy this beautiful economy just to get one phone call from Mr. Xi. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1821.92s)]
*  The markets right now are extremely good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, press. Thank you. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1830.48s)]
*  Okay, well, Donald Trump ending that actually far reaching a news conference off the back of [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1840.48s)]
*  the signing of some of the main story today. He'll call me. I promise. Believe it. He will [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1847.12s)]
*  call me on my cell phone late night when he needs my love. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7rnCUFufQ&t=1852.8799999999999s)]
