*  don't know what it's called, but it's like a stringy thing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=18.04s)]
*  It's pretty good. It's a I exfoliate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=21.04s)]
*  I also have a, you know, this is this is necessary for Chad [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=23.48s)]
*  Vice. We'll talk about that in a second. But what is this? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=33.8s)]
*  Oh, do you do in the shower? What's your routine? A regular [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=36.8s)]
*  shower or a long shower or a super shower? Well, I feel like [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=40.0s)]
*  I kind of want to run down of all of them. Super short shower [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=43.24s)]
*  is your everyday. That's hop in the shower, keep your head [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=45.64s)]

*  out easy peasy. That's five minutes. Okay, then a regular [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=51.68s)]
*  shower includes hair wash. So that is get in shower. I usually [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=54.84s)]
*  start shampoo, I do conditioner, I let the conditioner sit in my [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=58.96s)]
*  hair while I do body wash and then I'm out. And everything [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  shower? No, after that is just a long shower. Okay, that's the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=65.28s)]
*  same step. But while the conditioners in your hair you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=69.28s)]
*  shave. Yes, okay, which is different than an everything [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=71.8s)]
*  shower. Everything shower starts before you even get in the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=75.52s)]
*  shower. This is crazy. I do not have different types of showers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=79.8s)]

*  is so goddamn complicated is crazy to me is wild is hard is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=95.56s)]
*  difficult as hell to be a lady. Don't get me started on [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=100.88s)]
*  everything bath. It includes dinner. No, every time I go in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=105.0s)]
*  the shower, I got a loofah or whatever it's called. I don't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=109.44s)]
*  even know if it's a loofah but it's like it's just like a like [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=113.16s)]
*  a washcloth that I use full body. And once a week I do or [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=116.4s)]
*  twice a week. I also shampoo and condition my hair. That's it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=122.84s)]
*  That's it. But every but like the shower is the same way you [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=127.28s)]
*  don't shave. No, everything shower for me starts with hair [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=132.12s)]
*  oil in my hair, leave it 30 minutes while I play a league [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=135.76s)]
*  game or something. And a face mask. So then I get in there, I [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=138.44s)]
*  can wash it off. So I get the mud mask off. I get the hair. I [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=141.84s)]
*  do shampoo. And then I do a hair mask and then I exfoliate. So [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=145.24s)]
*  then I go freaking sugar scrub everywhere sugar scrub, sugar [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=150.36s)]
*  scrub, sugar scrub. And that's when you get your that's like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=154.08s)]
*  shave. Yeah, because you're supposed to exfoliate before [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=156.4s)]
*  shaving your because then you don't get bumps. No one talks [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  about that. But we should so you got to exfoliate and then [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=162.0s)]
*  you shave you got to go multiple directions. I still haven't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=164.6s)]
*  figured out how some people have invisible pores besides laser. I [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=167.48s)]
*  don't understand that. But anyway, shave legs, shave [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=171.16s)]
*  everything. Sometimes in everything shower because I just [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=174.0s)]

*  by Amazon and his BDS go to kick exactly. That's like, you know, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=504.0s)]
*  there is a that's a pressure target on what's the difference [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=508.24s)]
*  in propriety and organic ones. Organic boycott targets are [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=511.0s)]
*  like, like McDonald's, McDonald's Israel after October [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=515.64s)]
*  seven came out with a statement to be like, we're giving free [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=519.92s)]
*  Big Macs to all the Israeli occupying force soldiers that are [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=523.28s)]
*  hungry after a long day of doing so. Then everyone obviously was [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=526.0s)]
*  very resentful towards that got very, and, and, and that became [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=531.88s)]
*  like a organically became like a, like a boycott target. Same with [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=536.76s)]
*  like a lot of these other brands as well. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=540.76s)]
*  Starbucks, I don't even think is on the organic boycott target [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=549.92s)]
*  list anymore, but it might be the Starbucks one also came out [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  because the Starbucks unionization efforts during the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  Starbucks unionization efforts, there was a, I forget which [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=561.64s)]
*  branch it was, but there was a union organizer who wore a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=565.88s)]
*  Palestinian pin and they fired her for that pin. And then it [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=569.88s)]
*  turned into a, it turned into a major thing as well. So it's [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=573.04s)]
*  as well. I don't even think it's still on the, I don't even think [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=579.72s)]
*  it's still officially on the list, but [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=583.72s)]
*  but like Coca-Cola was added onto it recently. And so I stopped [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=593.88s)]
*  drinking diet Coke. That's why I guzzled these bad boys. Now [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=597.52s)]
*  Microsoft I believe was added on the list recently for mine. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=602.08s)]
*  Was it Minecraft or some like Microsoft was added onto it, but [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  like, it's not like I can't fucking switch over to Linux. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=610.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like there's, there is within, within [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=613.4000000000001s)]
*  the bounds of reason. I think it's like Xbox was recently put [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=617.32s)]
*  on and it turned into a priority target, but cancel the Xbox [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=620.6s)]
*  game pass subscription boycott, candy crush, Minecraft, call of [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=625.0s)]
*  duty, boycott all Microsoft gaming products, including [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=627.48s)]
*  Xbox brand and consoles, headsets, accessories, all [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=630.0s)]
*  games, publish about Microsoft labels. Sorry. Can't game [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=632.4399999999999s)]
*  anymore. This is why I don't game. That's it. Sorry. No, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=635.7199999999999s)]
*  Microsoft was added on as a priority target on, on April [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=640.4399999999999s)]
*  7th from the Palestinian BDS national committee. Yeah. They [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  fired workers for trying to speak out about them and even [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=651.04s)]
*  banned Palestinian skype accounts for just trying to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=653.04s)]
*  contact their families. Why did I think Dr. Pepper was a Coca-Cola [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=654.68s)]
*  product? I don't know. I don't, I mean, it's okay. A lot of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=657.36s)]
*  these, a lot of different sodas are sometimes literally owned [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=662.76s)]
*  by competitive conglomerates in different markets. So it's [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=667.12s)]
*  understandable to get it confused. Just try your best [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=671.88s)]
*  chat. That's it. Okay. Just try your best. That's my suggestion. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=675.04s)]
*  Try your best. Do your best. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ISOpcwh5pA&t=681.16s)]
