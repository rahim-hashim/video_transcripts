*  Keep going. Keep going. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, it's just like at this point, you know, what we've had happen is the kind [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1.08s)]
*  of normalizing of saying that the positions of the vast majority of American [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5.28s)]
*  Jews hold are it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=8.56s)]
*  It's a very slippery slope for to just be. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=11.28s)]

*  Even with the IRA, there was a political wing of the movement and there was a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  militant wing of the movement. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=30.68s)]
*  These things cannot exist without the other. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=32.44s)]

*  resistance is going to become more violent as well. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=61.0s)]
*  Having said that, you still need a political movement or peaceful resistance [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=65.08s)]
*  to work alongside this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=68.92s)]

*  I genuinely think the reason why I lost to Candace Owens, who is a real anti-Semite, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=235.72s)]
*  was because. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=240.2s)]

*  So I think like she was like, all right, you know, this year [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=252.12s)]
*  we're going to give it to a real anti-Semite instead. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=255.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of surprising. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=258.56s)]
*  But they got her in the also in the intersection of of real anti-Semitism [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=260.56s)]
*  and also rabid anti-Zionism. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=265.56s)]
*  Yeah, because she because she like she because she went after their boy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=267.28s)]
*  She was like, well, why is Ben Shapiro so powerful or whatever? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=270.76s)]
*  It wasn't like he like part of the basis of their schism. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but she also was part of that really disgusting amplifying of like [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=276.36s)]
*  it started with the like ADL truther conspiracy. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I remember it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=286.4s)]
*  Yeah, because they've been obsessed with like going back to Leo Frank. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=288.12s)]
*  So the only thing that happened and then, you know, the reason that Israel [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=291.28s)]
*  does a part is because like in the Torah, it says to yes, Jews are, you know. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=295.84s)]
*  Oh, no, no, Talmud to. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=300.23999999999995s)]

*  I have to say, I tuned into it for a second. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=307.52s)]
*  That was like that was some dark shit with Andrew Tate and Dan Bilzerian. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=309.2s)]

*  They all just happen to be actual anti-Semites. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=331.16s)]
*  So then what happens? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=334.6s)]
*  Most of the anti-Zionist sentiment you hear come from people who aren't [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=336.56s)]
*  actually anti-Zionist at all. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=342.32s)]

*  anti-Semite. Truly a positive example for anti-Semites everywhere. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I have I do have a conspiracy on this, though. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=406.4s)]
*  I legitimately do have a conspiracy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=410.2s)]
*  I want to run it by both of you guys. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=411.96s)]
*  OK. I have the suspicion that the likes of Dan Bolzarian and the likes of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=413.84s)]
*  Andrew Tate and the likes of Candice Owens and like these very obviously [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=419.4s)]
*  anti-Semitic people are often elevated and highlighted because they're much [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=425.12s)]
*  easier to disparage, especially among like polite society, so that you can say, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=430.36s)]
*  see, every single person that shits on Israel is not doing so because of some [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=434.88s)]
*  progressive reason. Or, yeah, Jake Shields is another example, too. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=440.2s)]
*  But they're doing it because they're anti-Semitic. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=444.32s)]
*  So basically cast this broad brush and to justify the notion that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=446.32s)]
*  anti-Semitism and anti-Semitism are one of the same. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=452.56s)]
*  And it's always borne out of some mysterious secret [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=457.12s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=462.16s)]
*  That's the reason why, you know, Jews such as yourself are also [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=464.36s)]
*  criticizing Israel's actions. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=469.36s)]
*  I think that's like a pretty good theory. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=471.32s)]
*  I mean, I would say I think it's also it's it's good to elevate those people [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=473.32s)]
*  because then we don't have to pay attention to like all the Nazis who really love [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  Israel and all the people on the far right that that pro-Israel groups [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=480.92s)]
*  and Israeli government officials have really deep relationships with. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=485.88s)]
*  And there are actually far more of those those deep connections across the global [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=488.56s)]
*  far right with the pro-Israel movement than there are [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  the Candace Owens of the world. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=497.16s)]
*  Yeah, there are more rabidly anti-Semitic pro-Israel people out there than there [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  are Jews, anti-Zionist or pro-Zionist alike. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=503.88s)]
*  That is something that a lot of people fail to comprehend or consider. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=508.2s)]
*  Obviously, look at the Christian evangelical movement, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=512.64s)]
*  like those guys just simply either by force or gently want to send [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=516.48s)]
*  all the Jews to the desert so that the rapture can happen. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=522.0s)]
*  And then, you know, everybody obviously burns in eternal hellfire [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=525.88s)]
*  unless they convert to unless they convert to Christianity. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=530.12s)]
*  I would also add that like the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=535.52s)]
*  there is like I think a sense also was like that, like right wing appreciation [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=538.84s)]
*  of Israel, that like like they look at the the anti-Semitism is not just grounded [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  in the like apocalyptic, like millenarian style stuff about needing to gather [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=548.0s)]
*  all the Jews in Israel, although that's real for a lot of them. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=552.52s)]
*  But it's also about this idea that like, oh, yeah, the Jews run everything [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=555.5600000000001s)]
*  and we want you to like its idea. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=558.96s)]
*  Oh, it's like it's like a like a Japanese style of philis. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=561.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's like a model. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=564.4s)]
*  It's I mean, like a like a model global minority thing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, can you believe like these guys are point zero zero two percent [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=568.64s)]
*  of the world population yet drive like 20 percent of the discourse? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=571.92s)]
*  Like, imagine like, you know, how that would be if like, you know, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  India could finally stand up or, you know, like pick a country that has [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=577.88s)]
*  like a raging nationalist movement at this moment that like, you know, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=581.6s)]
*  could look at something like Israel and be like, that's a plausible outcome for us. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's that that to me explains a lot of it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=589.52s)]
*  Yeah, you notice I'm pretty sure stop antisemitism.org [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  did not go after Richard Spencer, who was, you know, very much like we want to do [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=594.92s)]
*  here what they've already done in Israel. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=599.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he called himself a white Zionist, I think. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=601.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=603.6s)]
*  And it was he had this like really freaky confrontation [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=604.6s)]
*  with a rabbi at a university in Texas. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=607.28s)]
*  I remember this really well, where like the rabbi, like he basically said, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=609.6s)]
*  like, how can you call me an anti-Semite? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=612.92s)]
*  I love what they've done with Israel. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=614.68s)]
*  I think we should do it here. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=616.1999999999999s)]
*  And the guy he was talking to was like, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  I remember pretty like he didn't he didn't quite have a good response to that. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=620.12s)]
*  Yeah, that is woke, woke antisemitism. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=624.04s)]
*  Being being pro-Israel is the the greatest [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=630.16s)]
*  shield that you can have as Ben Shapiro once famously openly admitted to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=635.28s)]
*  when Ann Coulter was saying some shit about Jewish people. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=639.6s)]
*  I don't know what she was saying, but she was saying like they control the media [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=642.12s)]
*  or whatever. And Ben Shapiro famously tweeted out and Coulter regarding Jews. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=644.76s)]
*  She loves Israel, so I will not lose sleep over her. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=649.24s)]
*  A very obviously antisemitic statement, like straight up, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=653.24s)]
*  just kind of giving the game away. But nobody really cares. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=656.28s)]
*  But that's just, you know, that's just how it works. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=659.72s)]
*  Really. I will say there is a [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=661.96s)]
*  troublesome nature to, I think, a lot of the prominent [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=666.96s)]
*  conversations taking place right now with the likes of Patrick, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=673.48s)]
*  but David, as Andrew Tate has returned from Romania [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=677.24s)]
*  to to come to the United States of America and, you know, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=682.52s)]
*  go on all these podcasts, go on his like media tour, where apparently [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=686.92s)]
*  biggest scam in history, Andrew Tate's explosive World War Two theory [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=690.4399999999999s)]
*  challenges the narrative. Oh, God. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  That's value tainment. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=698.04s)]
*  I just I find. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=700.04s)]
*  Do you know who Patrick, David is? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=702.12s)]
*  I've like heard the name. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=704.56s)]
*  Don't say anything. Oh, no. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  Hold on. Just talk about this on bad has bara. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=708.72s)]
*  Patrick. Oh, Patrick, but David, we did. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, no. So you do know you do know his background, then. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=713.7600000000001s)]
*  Just a tiny bit. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=717.08s)]
*  Because he is he is the most Israeli man who is not from Israel or Jewish. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=718.2s)]
*  He is. His name is Patrick. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=725.2s)]
*  But David on on first sight, you're like Felix has said this as well. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  Where he's like, oh, he's from Israel. Right. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  And he's like, no, he's not. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  He is he is a Syrian. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=735.52s)]
*  And I believe they fear nationalism. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, wait, you can't hear it. Hold on. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=742.96s)]
*  My I mean, that is because they apply it to World War Two. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=745.12s)]
*  That's what he calls the. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=747.72s)]
*  They say white nationalists do what Hitler did because he was a white nationalist. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=748.52s)]
*  So they say that when white people get together and are nationalistic, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=753.48s)]
*  it's like the Nazis, when other people get together and they're nationalistic. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=756.28s)]
*  It's not. Is this actually true? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=758.92s)]
*  Is this the largest Psyop in history? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=761.72s)]
*  I mean, World War Two has had such a profound effect on our culture [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=764.64s)]
*  up until this point now. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=767.56s)]
*  You know, World War Two is the basis for all good and bad in the entire world. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=769.28s)]
*  If I say noted scholar of of history, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=774.36s)]
*  it is legitimately crazy to see somebody who's who's like, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=777.88s)]
*  is having like the conversation of an eighth grader. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  But it's like the names of like a bunch of like now people in the White House [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=784.68s)]
*  are on the wall behind him. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=788.36s)]
*  Like it's a little alarming. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  If you name the worst person in history, you'll probably say Hitler. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  You won't say Stalin, who killed more because he was on our team. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=795.84s)]
*  Or Mao. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=798.16s)]
*  I love that they're also like deeply anti-communist at the same time. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=799.2s)]
*  Like he's I mean, it makes sense. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=802.96s)]
*  But but liberals also have this kind of attitude. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=805.36s)]
*  But he's just doing. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=810.28s)]
*  This is the lightest form, the most acceptable form of Holocaust [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=812.32s)]
*  revisionism that even liberals also entertain due to a lack of understanding [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=815.44s)]
*  or lack of knowledge or the deep resentment that people feel towards [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=820.08s)]
*  communism, where they just do like, well, you know, Stalin killed more. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=824.5200000000001s)]
*  Actually, he was worse than Hitler. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=828.72s)]
*  Maybe we were on the wrong side during World War Two. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=830.08s)]
*  You know, like that's the inevitable logical through line that you follow through. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=832.64s)]
*  Great stuff, though. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=837.9200000000001s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=838.84s)]
*  Let's go. This is something that I've talked about on bad [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=842.32s)]
*  Hasbro as well, but. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=844.6s)]
*  I. I don't understand why. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=847.88s)]
*  Liberal Zionists who are like otherwise progressive on other issues, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=853.52s)]
*  especially those living in the United States of America, like how [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=857.24s)]
*  they don't foresee the allegiance that they've cultivated [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=861.88s)]
*  with guys not like Andrew Tate, but like, you know, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=867.24s)]
*  maybe the average American Christian Zionist [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  as not on shaky grounds that could inevitably turn very dangerous towards them. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=875.3599999999999s)]
*  But instead, like this, you know, permanent allegiance, like I feel like [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  when people started saying America was built on Judeo-Christian values, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=885.28s)]
*  like there was a point where I think a lot of progressive [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=889.4799999999999s)]
*  liberal Zionist Jews started believing that. Yeah. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  And I don't know how you legitimately believe that, like these guys will [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=896.96s)]
*  100 percent quickly turn that conversation over to no, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  America was built on Christian values. The fuck are you talking about? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  Like, there's already a lot of. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=910.48s)]
*  There is already a lot of of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=913.12s)]
*  or always has been a lot of nascent, unexamined anti-Semitism [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=915.44s)]
*  everywhere in the United States of America and in the Western world. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=920.36s)]
*  But because of Israel's actions constantly being portrayed [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=925.2800000000001s)]
*  to the uninitiated as being being done at the behest of Judaism, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=930.8000000000001s)]
*  falsely associating Israel's actions with Judaism. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=937.88s)]
*  I think the first interaction that a lot of people have [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=941.12s)]
*  paired up with the anti-Semitic tendencies that people have [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=944.6400000000001s)]
*  lead them to think, no, it is. Yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=948.12s)]
*  OK. Israel's killing a lot of babies. And it is for the Jews. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=950.12s)]
*  I don't like the Jews anymore is like the the way that I think a lot of people [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=952.96s)]
*  encounter this. Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=957.84s)]
*  The subject. And that's how you explode anti-Semitism. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=959.32s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm curious what you I'll say two things on that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=962.52s)]
*  Like, first of all, I think this is why it just really drives me crazy [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=965.64s)]
*  when I get accused of anti-Semitism, because I'm like, do you understand [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=969.48s)]
*  that the Jews who are publicly deconflating ourselves with Israel [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=973.16s)]
*  are actually doing more to fight anti-Semitism around the world right now [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=978.12s)]
*  than all the rest of these organizations that are, you know, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=982.44s)]
*  they say they're fighting anti-Semitism, but they're actually just doing [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=985.44s)]
*  Israel advocacy. I mean, I do think that it is we there's a there's [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  kind of like a double message happening right now. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=992.6800000000001s)]
*  So like pro-Israel organizations basically say, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=994.36s)]
*  you know, you have to stand with all Jews. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=998.44s)]
*  That's standing with Israel is standing with Jews. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1000.0400000000001s)]
*  But then when Jews around the world get attacked, receive that blowback [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1002.44s)]
*  for Israel's actions, they're like, what the hell, that's anti-Semitic. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1006.08s)]
*  And it's like you can't really have it both ways. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1008.84s)]
*  I think, as you said, like the average person, that contradiction [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1011.12s)]
*  doesn't make sense to them. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1013.88s)]
*  And I'm I'm not saying it's I'm against, you know, random [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1015.28s)]
*  Jewish people being targeted for the actions of the Israeli state. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1020.08s)]
*  And I'm also against the Israeli state saying it's acting on behalf [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1022.6s)]
*  of Jews around the world. Yeah. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1026.28s)]
*  But I think the other part of the question, I mean, I think the easiest answer [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1028.24s)]
*  is like the ADL's conference this week was like a really good, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1031.8s)]
*  I think, showcase for this. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1036.84s)]
*  I mean, the ADL has has formed like, you know, a deep alliance [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1039.28s)]
*  with the far right in this country. Right. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1043.0s)]
*  I mean, you had Elise Stefanik headlining their conference. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1044.6s)]
*  And, you know, when then when she made like there's a there's this great article [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1048.76s)]
*  in JTA about the conference where Elise Stefanik, you know, white nationalist [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1052.12s)]
*  kind of supported a Holocaust revisions in a New York primary famously. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1058.56s)]
*  Did you at least the phone? Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1064.56s)]
*  Hold on. Let me pull it up real quick. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1067.12s)]
*  She's my my mom's registered to vote in her district. Really? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1068.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's a oh, there she is. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1072.6000000000001s)]
*  She's a special one. Elise Stefanik. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1075.96s)]
*  She literally made her name [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1079.0400000000002s)]
*  being one of the biggest proponents of great replacement theory in the house. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1081.4s)]
*  And now she's like the champion of anti-Semitism on campus. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1084.8000000000002s)]
*  Stefanik back candidate praised Hitler. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1088.16s)]
*  Question Texas and Buffalo shootings. Oh, there you go. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1090.0400000000002s)]
*  Oh, wait, Carl Paladino. Yeah. Oh, my God. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1094.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, he's like an old that's amazing. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  I didn't. Well, I like that she's he's so yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1098.48s)]
*  Carl Paladino. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1101.16s)]
*  He is a he got in big trouble, Governor. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1102.8s)]
*  And it was like a total he's been a walking nightmare for years. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1105.92s)]
*  Now it makes sense that she would cling to that. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1109.44s)]
*  Yeah. In 2022, Stefanik endorsed Carl Paladino in the election to succeed. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1112.32s)]
*  Retiring U.S. Representative Chris Jacobs in New York, 23rd Congressional District. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1116.84s)]
*  Stefanik reported they had a history of disputes with Paladino's rival [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1120.3600000000001s)]
*  in a Republican primary. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1122.8s)]
*  Paladino made comments on a radio show in 2021 praising Adolf Hitler, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1124.44s)]
*  saying he was the kind of leader we need today. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1128.08s)]
*  Stefanik condemned Paladino's remarks when asked about them by HuffPost, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1131.56s)]
*  but with but did not withdraw her endorsement after a call for the execution [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1134.6799999999998s)]
*  of Attorney General Merrick Garland, former Republican Congressman Mia Love [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1139.3999999999999s)]
*  called upon Stefanik to rescind her endorsement of Paladino. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1142.84s)]
*  Stefanik actively campaigned for Paladino, hosting a teller rally [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1145.6799999999998s)]
*  for him the night before the primary. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1149.6s)]
*  I mean, lines up. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  That's that. That's the number one. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1154.6799999999998s)]
*  That is the number one defender of Jewish people. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1156.32s)]
*  Our ambassador to the UN. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1160.2s)]
*  Yeah. Fantastic stuff. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1161.8s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1163.96s)]
*  So like she's like the headline speaker at their conference, you know, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1164.8s)]
*  then she makes some like kind of out of pocket pro trust. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1167.32s)]
*  She like said something like if Trump were president, October 7th [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1170.52s)]
*  wouldn't have happened. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1173.28s)]
*  And then all of a sudden people were upset. Right. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1174.44s)]
*  And they were there's all these great quotes that are like, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1176.68s)]
*  oh, this is a non-political conference. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1179.36s)]
*  Like, what is she doing? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1181.72s)]
*  You know, bringing politics in here. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1182.84s)]
*  I'm like, guys, are you where where did you miss the memo? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1184.32s)]
*  I mean, the the one I think of is the like, I still can't believe he blew this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1188.72s)]
*  Like, like apparently she got booed. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1193.4399999999998s)]
*  Stefanik booed at ADL Summit for claiming October 7th [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1195.3999999999999s)]
*  and wouldn't have had it under Trump. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1197.56s)]
*  But to be clear, like everything else she said, you know, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1199.12s)]
*  we're going to make the list of students, we're going to deport the students, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1201.6799999999998s)]
*  we're going to fight anti-Semitism at the UN. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1204.2s)]
*  I mean, all like the idea that all of that is fine. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1206.2s)]
*  It's like I think that there is. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1209.48s)]
*  I'm curious if you experience this still. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1211.96s)]
*  I think in parts of the communities that we grew up in, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1213.7199999999998s)]
*  there's a there's an internal narrative that like [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1215.56s)]
*  Israel is kind of just like our own internal issue. Right. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1218.0s)]
*  And so we're glad that these people help us and we have to form these unlikely [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1220.6s)]
*  alliances and it and it doesn't kind of. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1225.04s)]
*  It doesn't connect to the kind of broader politics. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1228.1599999999999s)]
*  And I mean, I obviously think that's not just laughable, but like [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1230.8s)]
*  insane when you're literally. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1236.08s)]
*  Were they booing him because they were like, no, it definitely would have happened [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1238.32s)]
*  regardless because the Arabs are like anti-Semitic, parasitic monsters. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1241.36s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  Like it's also like a lot of a lot of the people at the ADL, like are like [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1246.12s)]
*  they voted for Kamala Harris. Right. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1250.04s)]
*  They voted for they were like they're they're Democrats. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1251.6399999999999s)]
*  Like this is a I don't think that they represent like the broad [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1254.32s)]
*  as the Gallup polling today points out, they do not represent the broad, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1258.04s)]
*  you know, majority of how democratic voters and people who identify as democratic [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1262.12s)]
*  feel about Israel or Gaza or anything that's happened in the last year and a half. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1267.6799999999998s)]
*  But the ADL and a lot of these organizations, like if you look at the people [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1271.9599999999998s)]
*  who fill these rooms, who attend to these kinds of conferences, like they're not [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1276.1599999999999s)]
*  it's not CPAC, you know, just because it's crazy Zionist. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1280.2399999999998s)]
*  It's very, you know, like they believe in a very dogmatically [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1284.1599999999999s)]
*  pro-Israel, pro-genocide policy. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1288.9199999999998s)]
*  And as you know, as Simone was just discussing, like everything, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1290.8s)]
*  particularly around campuses now, you know, things that are draconian [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1295.2s)]
*  and hard line that we would associate with like the worst qualities of McCarthyism. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1298.32s)]
*  But they also it's not CPAC. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1302.84s)]
*  Like it is. It is. I think like there is a meaningful distinction there. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1305.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, people still think they're at a conference of a civil rights [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1309.92s)]
*  organization that is literally helping dismantle civil rights protections [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1313.04s)]
*  in this country right now. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1317.16s)]
*  And the thing I was bringing up was the green. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1318.28s)]
*  But to me, the like sort of the most emblematic, like the moment [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1319.76s)]
*  that like we'll be telling our kids about like to this effect is the like [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1323.04s)]
*  Elon Musk, Sig Heil, like that there was this like that he does the salute [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1326.6s)]
*  and shows on Barry Weiss, my favorite, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1330.68s)]
*  really opens the door for all these other fucking people to do the same thing, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1333.0s)]
*  whether it's Bannon or that weirdo priest, like all these people do it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1336.52s)]
*  It becomes like this viral gesture that people associate with right wing [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1340.12s)]
*  movements of the moment. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1343.0s)]
*  You know, it is normalization. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  Cliche is the word is. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1346.52s)]
*  And like Greenblatt's initial response was, well, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1347.92s)]
*  and then he eventually has to. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1352.28s)]
*  What did they call it? The awkward gesture? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1353.92s)]
*  The awkward. Yeah. And then he's autistic. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1355.68s)]
*  He's autistic. Yeah. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1357.92s)]
*  He's stimming or whatever. Yeah. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1359.04s)]
*  And now Barry Weiss also. Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1360.48s)]
*  So that's it's like it's it's it's like he's, you know, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1362.12s)]
*  so that to me is the like in in miniature, like the whole thing [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1364.84s)]
*  just gets summed up in that that like because these people are pro-Israel, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1369.08s)]
*  they will give them the not just the benefit of the day. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1373.32s)]
*  They'll defend them. Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1376.08s)]
*  Yeah. But it's also important. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1377.36s)]
*  Like this is what these people have been doing for years. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1378.4s)]
*  I mean, Jonathan Greenblatt, you know, took a selfie at the opening [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1381.2800000000002s)]
*  of the Jerusalem embassy when Trump moved, moved the U.S. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1384.68s)]
*  embassy to Jerusalem, like with a lineup of the craziest far right. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1388.3600000000001s)]
*  People who he had literally the ADL Trump won. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1393.44s)]
*  The ADL was against like a ban and it was against all people [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1396.48s)]
*  he was putting in his administration. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1399.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they did. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1400.68s)]
*  The Jews will not replace a shit at Charlottesville like 2017. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1401.3600000000001s)]
*  It was like, you know, like within the first few months, you know, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1405.72s)]
*  that would be like three months from now or sorry, five months from now. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1408.12s)]
*  If it were the, you know, if, you know, in today's terms, like [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1411.2399999999998s)]
*  it was totally bizarre and like insane. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1414.9199999999998s)]
*  But the he yeah, no, you're exactly right. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1418.9599999999998s)]
*  They like he backed down. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1421.3999999999999s)]
*  The tree of life synagogue shooting was a Trump supporter [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1422.8799999999999s)]
*  who literally outflank Trump. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1426.52s)]
*  He talked openly on Gab, the neo-Nazi website, about how [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1428.4799999999998s)]
*  I love Donald Trump, but he's not doing enough to like deal with the Jews, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1433.9599999999998s)]
*  that are bringing in the caravans, which is such a common [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1438.08s)]
*  trope that has existed in perpetuity whenever they like that. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1443.72s)]
*  That's super, super normalized. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1448.4399999999998s)]
*  Like that's what that's what Tucker Carlson was talking about. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1451.1599999999999s)]
*  Replacement. That's what also Ali Stefanik has also boosted. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1454.6s)]
*  So and I think that's what the Buffalo Shooter also believe. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1459.0s)]
*  I will add, I think that a lot of people believe that like the that, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1462.4399999999998s)]
*  you know, like the anti-Semitism that arises from discourse [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1466.6s)]
*  about broader replacement theory, that there are elites who want to use [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1470.08s)]
*  immigrants to replace, you know, like the disenfranchised, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1473.3999999999999s)]
*  right, true blooded Americans or believe that like the anti-Semitic [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1477.72s)]
*  quality of that is like foam spilling over the glass. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1481.48s)]
*  It's unfortunate. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1485.04s)]
*  But the thrust of our point, which is that there is like this [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1486.24s)]
*  unaccountable elite that wants to replace you with like a Filipino nurse or whatever. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1489.1599999999999s)]
*  Like that's like that's the ballgame. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1494.12s)]
*  And so at least to panic, like, does she herself have anti-Jewish animus [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1497.04s)]
*  at this rate, perhaps? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1500.6399999999999s)]
*  But, you know, it's also entirely plausible to me that she doesn't have any, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1501.6399999999999s)]
*  but she actively does not give a shit about those who do. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1505.08s)]
*  This is definitely the bargain that people like a tablet magazine make, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1508.36s)]
*  because they believe that the thrust of their argument is is like wholly true [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1511.1999999999998s)]
*  and that they can identify with. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1516.28s)]
*  So they will cover it up. They'll actively cover it up. Yeah. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1517.8s)]
*  There was a there was another funny moment [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1521.48s)]
*  where this contradiction amongst like a relatively progressive [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1523.92s)]
*  liberal Zionist figure who was wearing a fucking IDF dog tag [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1528.72s)]
*  at the anti-Semitism congressional hearing, talking to Josh Hawley. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1532.64s)]
*  I don't know if you guys watched that. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1535.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I watched it yesterday when it was happening. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1538.3200000000002s)]
*  And it's like he has the the yellow ribbon for the hostages. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1540.72s)]
*  He has a fucking IDF dog tag on. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1544.5200000000002s)]
*  And he has to describe to Josh Hawley [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1547.72s)]
*  that their position overall is alongside the ADL's position, apparently, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1550.8400000000001s)]
*  that it is not acceptable to deport students for their [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1556.5600000000002s)]
*  which I was shocked to hear that that was the ADL position as well. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1562.48s)]
*  But that their their position as as administrators [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  and an institute of higher learning is that they should not deport [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1569.28s)]
*  students for for, you know, protesting against Israel. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1574.44s)]
*  And someone from the ADL who said that? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1578.96s)]
*  No, it was I forget what organization he was from. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1580.56s)]
*  Was it Kevin Racklin from Nexus? Nexus. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1583.68s)]
*  Yeah. Now, I don't know what his like actual opinions are, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1587.52s)]
*  but it's very obvious that he was like, like even he was like, no, we can't. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1589.8s)]
*  Like, that's not acceptable. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1594.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, you can't just like deport people. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1596.52s)]
*  And then Josh Hawley kept saying, like, you don't want to deport students [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1597.88s)]
*  who assault Jews. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1600.52s)]
*  You don't want to deport students who assault Jews. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1601.6000000000001s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1603.32s)]
*  Yeah. And they accused him of being on ketamine. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1604.24s)]
*  I have heard that. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1606.6s)]
*  Oh, wait, Josh Hawley or the person from Nexus? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1607.6s)]
*  Kennedy, I think Senator Kennedy, like asked [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1611.3999999999999s)]
*  Kevin if he was on ketamine. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1615.8s)]
*  I mean, anyways, like, I think the point is that like [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1617.1599999999999s)]
*  what basically has happened now is like you've had all these [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1619.3999999999999s)]
*  like Kevin, I would say, is someone who's like a kind of mainstream [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1624.72s)]
*  liberal Jewish guy who's society perspective. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  How? Yeah, he here it is, by the way. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1632.32s)]
*  Sorry. You go and keep going. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1635.12s)]
*  Well, it's just like at this point, you know, what we've had happen [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1636.44s)]
*  is the kind of normalizing of saying that the positions of the vast majority [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1640.12s)]
*  of American Jews hold are it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1643.48s)]
*  It's a it's a very slippery slope for to just be. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1646.36s)]
*  I mean, the obvious end point is Trump saying, you know, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1649.48s)]
*  the 80 percent of Jews who didn't vote for me are disloyal. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1652.56s)]
*  All of that. Calling Chuck Schumer a Palestinian. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1656.12s)]
*  That that whole kind of like discourse and then Steve Bannon, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1659.48s)]
*  what I saw someone in the. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1662.28s)]
*  Yeah, the ban ban ban and just saying, you know, liberal Jews [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1663.32s)]
*  who don't support Israel are the greatest threat to Israel, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1666.28s)]
*  the greatest threat to our movement. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1668.68s)]
*  But the point is, is that like when groups like the ADL constantly normalize [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1670.92s)]
*  calling people like me and Noah anti Semites out of the consensus, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1674.84s)]
*  all these things like it's just very easy to keep moving that bar [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1678.72s)]
*  like farther and farther to the right, where it just says that like [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1682.28s)]
*  the 80 percent of American Jews who are MAGA are disloyal. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1686.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they're not they're not sufficiently pro-America. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1691.56s)]
*  They're not sufficiently or they only care about Israel. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1694.28s)]
*  We should just send them to Israel. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1697.24s)]
*  That is the end point of this. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1698.8s)]
*  And I don't know why [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1700.08s)]
*  like otherwise progressive Jewish people just have been so brain broken [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1702.28s)]
*  by Zionism and internalizes so much. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1707.36s)]
*  And also, I will say it only took three years for Ukraine. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1711.6399999999999s)]
*  The Ukraine war to become such a domestically, politically polarized thing [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1716.2s)]
*  that Trump threatens to deport all of the Ukrainians, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1720.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, given protected refugee status in the United States. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1723.96s)]
*  Like, I do think that there is like a quality where there are at least a few people [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1727.6000000000001s)]
*  in the pro-Israel movement who've been watching what's happening [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1731.88s)]
*  to the Ukrainians and to the like, the way that Trump has been managing [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1736.0s)]
*  like the like the cessation of hostilities in that war and are thinking like, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1740.28s)]
*  well, you know, maybe in a decade or two, you know, like the situation could be [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1744.36s)]
*  such that like we're the ones in that position as well. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, I think that there is like a certain amount of like recognizing that this is [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1751.4799999999998s)]
*  just like this is excess, even by the standards of people who do believe that. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1755.9599999999998s)]
*  Like, yeah, like it's an it's an unsafe time to be a Jewish student [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1760.52s)]
*  on a college campus or whatever. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1764.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's the that's the other side of this story, because I think it like [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1766.56s)]
*  the reason why I keep asking you this question is because like, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1772.24s)]
*  I mean, you've obviously written and talked about extensively about [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1775.72s)]
*  the pervasive nature of Zionism as a as a formative [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1780.76s)]
*  part of the social conditioning of American Jews who still very much [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1785.76s)]
*  are progressive with this very notable exception. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1790.96s)]
*  And there's a contradiction there. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1796.8s)]
*  So could you elaborate a little bit more on how that [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1798.8s)]
*  how that journey begins, maybe even by talking about your own personal experiences? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1803.72s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. I want anything. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1808.44s)]
*  I left a glass of water on the counter. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1810.52s)]
*  I know I'm bringing that to you, but I'm still I'm going to get it from there. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1812.12s)]
*  Great. Go ahead. No, I'm good. I'm good. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1815.48s)]
*  Well. This is this one goes back. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, this is great because Noah and I, Noah and I got to know [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1823.12s)]
*  I got to see some of this in action because we had our journeys alongside each other. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1827.28s)]
*  I mean, I think that you just kind of said it, but, you know, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1832.6s)]
*  those of us who were raised with this narrative of like civil rights, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1835.96s)]
*  of being kind of on the side of social justice. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1838.96s)]
*  I came to campus genuinely being like, I care about social justice. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1841.96s)]
*  I care about Israel. These things are not in contradiction. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1845.56s)]
*  Like I'm going to make some friends. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1847.8s)]
*  I'm going to tell them my truth. They're going to teach me their truth. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1849.44s)]
*  Like, it's all going to be good. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1851.8s)]
*  And, you know, for those who have seen Israelism, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1853.2s)]
*  it was a long journey of kind of like facing the contradictions [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1857.76s)]
*  in the worldview that I I was raised in. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1861.0s)]
*  Many nights of like staying up late, talking with my roommates [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1865.84s)]
*  about why I believed the things that I believed. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1869.6799999999998s)]
*  And ultimately, it was, you know, I think for people who are on campuses right now, like. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1873.6s)]
*  I'm one of those people for whom campus activism [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1881.1599999999999s)]
*  like shook me to my core and it didn't happen overnight. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1884.96s)]
*  I initially was like, why is my community not doing good enough Israel advocacy? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1888.44s)]
*  I went back being like, guys, we've got to do we got to have better talking points. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1892.92s)]
*  Like, we got to fight back against what these students are saying. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1896.6000000000001s)]
*  You were you were a Hasbro warrior. Oh, yeah, 100 percent. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1899.24s)]
*  And I was like, we got to do better Hasbro. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1902.3200000000002s)]
*  And I went looking for better answers. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1904.68s)]
*  And the reality is, is that there aren't better answers [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1908.2s)]
*  because this thing is indefensible. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1911.3600000000001s)]
*  And once you kind of stop using those justifications about most moral army that we're [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1913.08s)]
*  you know, I think it's really hard to to face that people you love [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1919.48s)]
*  are complicit in something that is monstrous and to face that like [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1922.9199999999998s)]
*  you think of yourself as a good person and you are supporting something that is [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1926.56s)]
*  that is bad. And it takes a long time to kind of unlearn that kind of programming. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1930.56s)]
*  And to like, I mean, Noah and I are both people who, like as college students, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1936.12s)]
*  really had to sit together and like turn over these worldviews. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1940.32s)]
*  Damn, she keeps throwing you under the bus, Noah. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1942.64s)]
*  No, it's true, though. I mean, she I'll give her showing you under the bus. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1944.5600000000002s)]
*  No, no, no. We were one step removed from pulling up the Berkeley article. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1947.8400000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. I talked about on stream with them divestment. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1951.72s)]
*  My my your junior like let's go. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1956.24s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Our shared our shared experience. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1959.4s)]
*  No, the because Simone and like I had had a little bit before college [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1962.8000000000002s)]
*  because of my own experiences in Israel, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1968.92s)]
*  like a bit more of the like loosening before I had come to campus, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1972.0s)]
*  like the jar on my Zionism had been loosened, let's say, or the lid on it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1975.3600000000001s)]
*  But then it was like when we were at the campus, like it like there was still [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1979.6000000000001s)]
*  a lot of work to do and a lot of room to grow in that we, you know, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1984.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, to me, at least it felt like this like progressive, not in the political sense, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1990.04s)]
*  but just this like like this continuing experience of just like learning [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=1994.76s)]
*  how this thing that we had felt was like our community, the world in which we came from, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2000.12s)]
*  like the institutions and establishment that like taught us what we considered, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2004.6s)]
*  like the social justice values that we brought with us where we went. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2008.4s)]
*  Like this experience of like constant antagonism and rejection [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2011.8799999999999s)]
*  from like what were really not hostile positions or even that confrontational, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2017.12s)]
*  particularly by the standards of today. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2021.08s)]
*  You know, like we were like Simone and I were very involved in the way we got [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2023.24s)]
*  involved in that was we were involved in the J Street U chapter on our campus, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2026.3600000000001s)]
*  which I've talked about on the stream before. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2030.0s)]
*  Which you were. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  So you were like a little bit more woke already, though, in comparison to like. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2032.32s)]
*  No, I mean, I say that, but it's like I came as a freshman, Simone was a junior [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2037.0s)]
*  and like she was on the national board. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2040.2s)]
*  You know, she like we were like, like she organized Noah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2041.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Like I'm here because of because of her. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2044.44s)]
*  But the thing that was very like, no wonder you were on the 2020 list. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2047.64s)]
*  Just the thing that was making little [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2053.2s)]
*  little pro Hamas Jews all around American college campuses. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2057.12s)]
*  I personally am responsible for all the blowback. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2061.04s)]
*  We're not royalty. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2064.72s)]
*  Yeah, we had that was this experience of like we tried to get like our chapter [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2065.7999999999997s)]
*  recognized by the Jewish Student Union within the Hillel. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2071.0s)]
*  And that was this crazy ordeal, both because of the insane [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2073.6s)]
*  like bylaws of that organization. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2076.72s)]
*  But it just became this excuse of like, yes, we want a two state solution. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2078.72s)]
*  Most of us identify as Zionists. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2083.0s)]
*  And like we were not allowed to have our club be affiliated with Hillel. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2085.28s)]
*  Like that was like to me, part of this like experience of like [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2088.96s)]
*  combined with like learning and all of the, you know, whatever it like [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2092.76s)]
*  the ballasts being removed, holding up my Zionism, you know, like defenses [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2096.1600000000003s)]
*  like more was moral fall army falling away. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2100.6s)]
*  Some of them already had by that time, but just, you know, it it it it [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2103.32s)]
*  it was, like I said, a progressive process. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2106.84s)]
*  It just sort of accelerated and sort of set, at least speaking for myself, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2108.6800000000003s)]
*  certainly set me on the path of of, you know, being even more critical of [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2112.64s)]
*  the, you know, the even I guess even more critical of the of what I had felt. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2119.56s)]
*  Like it was it was a journey. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2124.3199999999997s)]
*  It wasn't like an end point. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2126.04s)]
*  I didn't feel like, oh, I've had these realizations. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2127.04s)]
*  It's over. It was like a process that set me into being into the kind of person [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2128.7999999999997s)]
*  and place I am today over many years. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2132.52s)]
*  I would also say like the things that you and I experienced together on campus. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2134.52s)]
*  It was like, you know, one of the critiques that we often get from people [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2137.8399999999997s)]
*  to our right is like, why aren't you trying to do change within the system? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2141.4s)]
*  Why aren't you trying to do something that's like, I don't know, more conciliatory, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2144.48s)]
*  more, you know, slow and incremental. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2148.1600000000003s)]
*  And like. I cannot tell you like how radicalizing it was [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2151.92s)]
*  to be a like young liberal Zionist coming into my Hillel and just being like, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2157.1600000000003s)]
*  hey, can we just like talk about this thing that I heard about or like, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2161.6s)]
*  can I just have an activist who, you know, is deeply committed and lives there [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2165.88s)]
*  and but also wants to tell us about these things that he sees. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2170.64s)]
*  And they would like students would come into our meetings. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2174.44s)]
*  And this is again, like I can't even imagine a decade later. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2176.64s)]
*  I know that what's happening to college students now is way crazier [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2179.7599999999998s)]
*  than what happened to us. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2182.56s)]
*  I mean, we would try to we would bring these speakers. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2183.64s)]
*  Students would sit in our meetings with cameras. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2186.6s)]
*  There's like six of us being like, hey, we just want to learn about [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2189.12s)]
*  what's happening in East Jerusalem and like. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2191.96s)]
*  But not to cut you off, but chat at this point, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2194.04s)]
*  like engaging in like anti-Zionist activism, right? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2198.3199999999997s)]
*  You're you're still talking about like, oh, no. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2202.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, she's talking about we were like the nice liberal. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2204.7999999999997s)]
*  Trying to be like, let's talk about the kind of harder things about Israel [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2208.9199999999996s)]
*  so we can try to make it better. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2213.24s)]
*  Yeah, like because we care about our community, we want to talk about hard things [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2214.56s)]
*  and we want to try to change them from the inside. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2218.0s)]
*  And I will add, like if there was like a political dimension to it [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2219.68s)]
*  on the national level, which there was, it's not if there was. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2222.9199999999996s)]
*  It was in the words of like the organization from JSTR at the time. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2226.0s)]
*  We were Obama's backing block. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2229.84s)]
*  I mean, that was like I think of that phrase like all the time. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2231.76s)]
*  Like the idea was we viewed ourselves as Obama's shooters on the college [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2234.36s)]
*  campus, backing up what his efforts were with John Kerry [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2237.5200000000004s)]
*  to bring about a two state solution. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2240.28s)]
*  And, you know, like like so to someone's point about [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2242.0400000000004s)]
*  like what it meant, oh, why don't you work from change within the system? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2245.96s)]
*  It was like we were doing educational events on campus, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2248.5600000000004s)]
*  focused on coexistence without a particular without any meaningful [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2251.4s)]
*  radical political valence. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2254.44s)]
*  And then, you know, nationally, what was it saying that Obama is doing a good job? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2256.12s)]
*  It was not radical by any particular crazy experience. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2259.96s)]
*  This shadow says people don't realize how ingrained Hasbro is the American Jews, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2263.96s)]
*  especially young Jews. I remember my Jew camp. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2266.84s)]
*  We had an Israel day where Israeli socials would come to our camp [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2268.44s)]
*  and simulate combat drills with us. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2270.76s)]
*  Everyone thought this was normal. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2272.48s)]
*  Yeah, like there is a I mean, look from the as an outsider, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2274.44s)]
*  OK, someone who is not also shall we met at a JSTR U [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2280.28s)]
*  conference in 2014? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2283.48s)]
*  Ha ha. Damn. OK. Why? OK. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2284.52s)]
*  You all of you guys are actually connected to one another. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2286.88s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2290.32s)]
*  That's right. Everybody everybody's met. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2292.32s)]
*  And I, as on beyond good behavior. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2294.48s)]
*  So oh, God, I'm getting a clipped. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2297.6s)]
*  So I feel like there must have been a pivotal moment for you, though. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2300.36s)]
*  Like so you're saying that the reaction that you got from [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2305.36s)]
*  like Jewish groups that technically are supposed to welcome you [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2309.4s)]
*  because like you just have dissent within your own in group, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2315.76s)]
*  them pushing you aside and saying that you're like woke, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2321.8s)]
*  you're doing like woke, silly anti-Israel nonsense. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2324.88s)]
*  Despite the fact that you were pro-Israel at the time, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2329.08s)]
*  was that like the the pivotal moment that caused you to reflect on the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2331.7200000000003s)]
*  all of the obvious propaganda that you were growing up with? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2336.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would say it's always like it's like it's always two kind of [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2343.28s)]
*  things at the same time. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2347.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like you're seeing the reality on the ground in Palestine. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2348.04s)]
*  You're seeing what Palestinians are experiencing. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2350.84s)]
*  It's a radicalizing experience. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2352.56s)]
*  And then at the same time, you come back and you're like, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2354.36s)]
*  because initially I was like, guys, do you know about this? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2356.76s)]
*  You know, it's like really innocent. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2359.56s)]
*  I was like 18 and I was like, can we have a good faith [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2360.7200000000003s)]
*  conversation about this thing that seems really bad? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2363.28s)]
*  And the answer is no, you can't have a good faith conversation. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2365.64s)]
*  And one of the things they say is like, you're not supposed to air [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2368.28s)]
*  the community's dirty laundry. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2370.92s)]
*  So we were like, oh, my God, we were trying to have these conversations. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2372.08s)]
*  To bring up, though, the example of this, the one I will think about forever. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2376.04s)]
*  Do you were you I forget if you were abroad this semester, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2379.64s)]
*  but when we went to the Consul General's house. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2382.28s)]
*  No, you weren't there. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2384.96s)]
*  OK, so you were because you were you went you you. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2386.64s)]
*  Someone was abroad the second semester of your freshman year. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2389.76s)]
*  Right. And so we're going deep into. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2392.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this is the Lord. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2394.68s)]
*  No, but so so the Israel Consul General at that time [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2397.2s)]
*  had a really beautiful home in. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2400.6s)]
*  Piedmont, like a wealthy, like a wealthy enclave near Berkeley or whatever. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2406.24s)]
*  And a bunch of like Jewish student leaders were all identified to go there one night. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2410.96s)]
*  And like essentially the message from this Consul General was to all of us, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2415.2s)]
*  like, you know, it was like it was like a warm vibe, every smiling coming in. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2419.7599999999998s)]
*  But he was like, listen, listen, it's not good that we air [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2422.96s)]
*  our dirty laundry in front of the public like this. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2425.52s)]
*  Like this was a thing I was told directly by an Israeli diplomat, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2427.12s)]
*  you know, speaking to a room full of college students. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2431.64s)]
*  And again, I was at the time I must have been 19 years old. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2434.16s)]
*  I thought it was normal. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2437.2799999999997s)]
*  Or at least I thought that if it wasn't normal, it was like a sign of how serious [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2438.56s)]
*  and meaningful the work we were doing was. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2442.24s)]
*  I'll say for me, like the the final straw of my college experience was that [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2444.3199999999997s)]
*  the you already talked about this, that there was a divestment campaign again [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2448.72s)]
*  during my senior year. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2452.56s)]
*  And I'm not proud of this. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2453.6s)]
*  But basically what we did as the JSTU chapter was that we wrote, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2456.4s)]
*  we were like, OK, so let's not do divestment. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2461.0s)]
*  Let's let's it was the, you know, don't divest, invest in peace, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2463.84s)]
*  you know, show that we believe that, you know, America can be a force for good [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2467.32s)]
*  and blah, blah, blah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2471.44s)]
*  And so we wrote a bill that basically said that we supported, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2472.48s)]
*  you know, an end to the occupation and dealing with the settlements. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2476.56s)]
*  Super mild language, but just basically like, you know, pro two state solution, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2480.3199999999997s)]
*  U.S. diplomacy kind of things. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  And we're in a closed door negotiation with other folks in Hillel. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2487.0s)]
*  And one of the students said, well, you need to also have Hamas rockets in there [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2491.56s)]
*  if you're going to say this. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2496.6s)]
*  And I was like, OK, well, if we put that in, can we also say [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2497.48s)]
*  like the human rights violations? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2501.48s)]
*  And they were like, no, absolutely not. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2503.4s)]
*  And and ultimately where the the negotiation between us ended is like [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2506.12s)]
*  one of the students explicitly saying to me, we will not our organization [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2510.12s)]
*  will not sign on to anything that has anything critical of Israel in it. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2514.04s)]
*  And so ultimately, I found myself in this position where I was like, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2518.08s)]
*  why am I trying to do a unity thing? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2521.16s)]
*  Like I I have this one of the things that we like [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2522.92s)]
*  in the kind of Jewish community, one of the narratives is about communal unity. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2526.52s)]
*  That's how like all these organizations, ADL, AJC, all these groups, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2530.3199999999997s)]
*  like part of how they have their mandate and kind of advance their hegemony [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2534.12s)]
*  is by demanding that like the Jewish community speak in one voice. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2538.08s)]
*  And I really wanted to do that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2542.12s)]
*  But then I realized very quickly that like what the compromise of that was, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2544.52s)]
*  was silencing myself and basically conceding to the hegemony of like, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2548.7999999999997s)]
*  we will not say anything about Israel in public. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2554.68s)]
*  And all of a sudden I realized like I see myself as a person [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2556.52s)]
*  who wants to support change. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2559.52s)]
*  I see myself as a person who is against human rights violations, all that. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2561.2799999999997s)]
*  Why am I on the other side of the people? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2565.24s)]
*  Like that was the moment where I was like, why am I on the other side [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2567.84s)]
*  of these SJP students who like I agree with, I support. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2570.32s)]
*  I disagree with their tactics, but I think what they're talking about, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2574.84s)]
*  you know, I mean, they were talking about divesting from settlements. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2577.44s)]
*  Like it was. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2579.6400000000003s)]
*  It was a really it's like what it's something that I I feel a lot of like [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2581.36s)]
*  sadness about the fact that like [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2586.28s)]
*  students like me were like part of blocking efforts like that. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2588.8s)]
*  And of course, you know, after that thing, one of the students [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2592.2000000000003s)]
*  from the pro-Israel group turned around and wrote an article about how [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2594.6000000000004s)]
*  all of us in the J Street U chapter were like secretly colluding with SJP. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2597.96s)]
*  And I'm kind of like, I wish we had been. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2601.4s)]
*  Yeah, that would have been way more honorable than what we did. Yeah. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2603.28s)]
*  I mean, it is. They also had like, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2607.36s)]
*  I mean, there was a real [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2610.6400000000003s)]
*  it also feels like a bit of like a window, like a like a like a like a [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2613.88s)]
*  scene with like goggles into the future. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2617.84s)]
*  Some of the conduct of the like really hardcore pro-israel groups, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2619.8s)]
*  the group, the student group, I don't know if they still exist, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2622.6800000000003s)]
*  but in our day at Berkeley was called Tikva. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2624.6400000000003s)]
*  And like these it was it was like it was just like the first time [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2628.0s)]
*  I'd encountered like a kind of like radical, like right wing dogmatic [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2633.36s)]
*  and they carried over into this, you know, again, like they [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2636.6800000000003s)]
*  they tried to like make a social exiles within Jewish spaces. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2639.84s)]
*  They tried to make it incredibly difficult for us to be like for. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2643.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, I think they did it within their power, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2647.28s)]
*  which meant that they didn't have much ability to actually do it. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2649.2000000000003s)]
*  But like to the extent that they tried, like they did. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2651.8s)]
*  And I think the long term effect of it [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2654.56s)]
*  I mean, at least from my impression was down the line [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2658.24s)]
*  was that it like helped create an atmosphere that like, you know, again, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2661.04s)]
*  continued to put enormous pressure on Jewish members of the community [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2664.56s)]
*  at Berkeley, obviously, who were, you know, wanted to have any relationship [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2668.8399999999997s)]
*  with like, you know, communities they'd come from and their contemporary politics, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2673.4399999999996s)]
*  which is obviously just had the effect of making the organized [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2676.7599999999998s)]
*  Jewish community at the campus like, you know, seem way, way, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2679.6s)]
*  way right wing and pro-israel. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2683.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I want to I want to speak on that as well from my experiences [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2684.96s)]
*  with all of the young Jewish Hassan Abihed's [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2689.36s)]
*  that I met at the campus protest where they literally talked about being. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2693.96s)]
*  And they are that you're talking about this from the perspective of like [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2699.16s)]
*  still being a Zionist and still feeling outcasted, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2701.84s)]
*  still being made into a pariah. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2706.2400000000002s)]
*  These guys were already at like they were involved with JVP or SJP [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2708.92s)]
*  or sometimes unaffiliated, but like were obviously at the anti-Zionist [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2714.2s)]
*  protests on these on these college campuses. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2718.52s)]
*  Many of them were, you know, arrested as well. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2722.24s)]
*  And they talked about. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2725.64s)]
*  Not being able to take advantage of any of the Jewish community groups [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2728.48s)]
*  any longer because of their position on Israel, like even [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2732.64s)]
*  even if they were, you know, even if if they wanted to go to halal, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2738.08s)]
*  for example, they were cast aside and it made it harder for them to make friends. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2741.8s)]
*  Is what they were like. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2746.76s)]
*  It was a constant gripe that I heard from a lot of anti-Zionist Jews [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2748.0800000000004s)]
*  that they felt isolated from their own community, community they grew up in [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2753.1600000000003s)]
*  for, you know, being brave and being bold and recognizing the truth. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2758.48s)]
*  There's also a chatter in here that I haven't seen some of those documents [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2763.5600000000004s)]
*  because when a screening was scheduled at my college campus in twenty [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2765.96s)]
*  twenty three, admin postponed the screening, then fired the professor [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2768.8s)]
*  who organized it without cause, then ended the beloved weekly free film [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2771.6800000000003s)]
*  screening program in retaliation at Emerson College. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2775.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, shit. I just met your professor last week at the Jewish Left Conference in Boston. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2778.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, we really do all know each other, I guess. Yeah. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2783.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that really sucks, by the way, just you can watch it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2786.6000000000004s)]
*  It is available for streaming now on Al Jazeera and on Vice. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2789.6800000000003s)]
*  It's also on like, you know, Amazon and Apple TV and whatever. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2794.28s)]
*  But for free streaming, it is available. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2797.92s)]
*  So similarly, the chatter on screen, the professor, the screen is realism [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2800.12s)]
*  at Columbia back in early twenty twenty four face pushback from the admin [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2802.8s)]
*  to not show the doc. But she went ahead with it anyway. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2805.32s)]
*  She has not been pushed to take a year off starting next semester. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2807.84s)]
*  No way. I mean, push to take a year off. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2812.64s)]
*  She has not been pushed to take a year off starting next semester. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2816.12s)]
*  What does that mean, you be maybe she has been. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2818.44s)]
*  I think you meant she's been pushed to take a year off next semester. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2821.6s)]
*  Oh, now been she has now been pushed. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2824.8s)]
*  Yeah. Sure. I haven't heard about that. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2828.32s)]
*  I'm yeah. I mean, people, the kind of censorship, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2830.76s)]
*  like the kind of cowardice that we're seeing from university administrations [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2833.84s)]
*  right now is completely insane. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2836.84s)]
*  I mean, also for people who have seen the film, it's it's. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2838.52s)]
*  Let's put it this way, I think it's like pretty mild [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2843.76s)]
*  compared to some of the things that. Oh, yeah. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2845.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other thing. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2848.2400000000002s)]
*  How mild it's it's. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2849.2400000000002s)]
*  But the point is, is that it's it's describing something [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2851.08s)]
*  that's accurate and true for people, and that's even worse. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2853.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's something that I stress all the time, which is that [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2855.84s)]
*  like I there is no place for anti-Semitism [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2860.7200000000003s)]
*  as a community, obviously, like I don't allow it. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2863.7200000000003s)]
*  There's not even like it. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2866.8s)]
*  I actively work to try and pull people away from [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2870.04s)]
*  leaning into anti-Semitic opinions, anti-Semitic tendencies. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2875.2000000000003s)]
*  And yet time and time again, I get hit by the likes of ADL [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2878.6400000000003s)]
*  for all of the radical terrorism support that I engage in and all the anti-Semitism [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2884.04s)]
*  that I engage in and that and there is there has been some success [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2889.2s)]
*  by the ADL pushback and other content creators as well in this in this space [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2893.96s)]
*  that have made it their lives mission to basically try and get me deplatformed. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2898.76s)]
*  And I realized somewhere along the line that [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2904.04s)]
*  I think people like yourself [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2909.16s)]
*  or people like myself who command the attention [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2912.2s)]
*  of large progressive communities that have a bunch of young, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2916.44s)]
*  progressive leftist, socialist Jews in it as well, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2920.8399999999997s)]
*  are more dangerous to the cause of Israel [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2924.92s)]
*  than anti-Semites who are also anti-Israel. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2928.92s)]
*  And it kind of it kind of partners with this question. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2932.12s)]
*  This person is asking, is there not a material benefit to Israel [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2936.24s)]
*  and a support as the anti-Semitism increases in the West? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2938.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think that the reason why Benjamin Netanyahu can actively, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2941.32s)]
*  when he's not engaging in Holocaust revisionism, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2945.76s)]
*  collaborate with like open anti-Semitic, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2948.92s)]
*  ultra nationalist figures in Europe and even in the United States of America, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2952.04s)]
*  is because it is beneficial to [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2956.96s)]
*  it is beneficial to the interests of Israel that Jews in the West feel less safe. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2962.2000000000003s)]
*  That way, they either have to go to Israel [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2967.0s)]
*  or even if they don't go to Israel, they always offer material support to Israel [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2970.12s)]
*  because it is it is at the heart of the settler colonial project, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2974.44s)]
*  the ethno-supremacist, ethno-religious supremacist project of Zionism [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2980.7599999999998s)]
*  that there is constant danger to you. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2985.08s)]
*  And that's why we must be strong and we must dominate our enemies. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2987.7599999999998s)]
*  And and, you know, you know, Israel reconciles. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2991.96s)]
*  You can be a fighter by doing Hasbara. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2995.12s)]
*  Well, and it's like the idea is that like if anti-Semitism, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=2997.48s)]
*  like it's it's a sort of like like here's like the logical procession of it. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3000.2400000000002s)]
*  It's that like if we increase anti-Semitism in the West, if we make, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3003.64s)]
*  you know, like the wandering Jew go back to where he wandered from, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3007.2400000000002s)]
*  which is back to Israel, then it's you know, it's [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3010.0s)]
*  he is embracing his true heritage and his identity. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3013.36s)]
*  And that like structure of like hyper nationalist logic [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3015.92s)]
*  and ethno-nationalist chauvinism is akin to the same logic [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3018.48s)]
*  that these people want to deploy to reconcile the political contradictions [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3021.96s)]
*  that exist in their own countries, in their own places, wherever those are. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3025.16s)]
*  So it's also like it's it's that the anti-Semitism, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3028.7999999999997s)]
*  like it helps Israel in the sense of like how Israel is. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3031.8799999999997s)]
*  It's currently constructed. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3034.48s)]
*  But like it is like it serves a purpose in the worldview of these anti-Semites. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3035.92s)]
*  That's not just that they actually think Jews run things, which, you know, again. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3040.24s)]
*  But it's like, again, this like model rogue state idea of this idea [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3043.72s)]
*  that like the way Israel has been able to use its ethno-nationalism [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3047.52s)]
*  to, again, resolve, like to pull its country together in their view [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3052.24s)]
*  and to make it the vibrant place that it is. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3057.4s)]
*  That's what's worth emulating. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3058.96s)]
*  That's what it's worth encouraging. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3060.08s)]
*  So if anything, there is a world, a twisted fucking way in which people view [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3062.36s)]
*  active anti-Semitism as actually being the most beneficial thing [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3066.96s)]
*  possible for the Jews in the long run. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3070.64s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that that is like an insane proposition as someone [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3073.36s)]
*  as someone whose name is Hassan, who's come to the United States [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3078.16s)]
*  of America numerous times before moving here in the post 9-11 universe. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3081.24s)]
*  I always I always look at the situation. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3087.4799999999996s)]
*  I'm like, it's as if Muslims in this country were actively being like, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3090.56s)]
*  you know, understand ISIS actually is true Islam. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3094.7999999999997s)]
*  And you're Islamophobic for saying that like what ISIS is doing is wrong. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3099.16s)]
*  Like, that's that's what it feels like to me when I when I hear someone [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3105.52s)]
*  who is like a like a vocal advocate for Israel over and over again. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3109.24s)]
*  Except, of course, the difference there is that because of Islamophobia, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3114.96s)]
*  playing a formative role in manufacturing consent for the war on terror, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3119.7599999999998s)]
*  people were actively making this comparison, actively tying Muslims back to ISIS [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3125.08s)]
*  and saying this is a your community problem. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3131.0s)]
*  Whereas with Israel, due to the prevalence of the Israeli lobby [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3133.64s)]
*  and and of course, Israel's role in American foreign policy in the region [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3137.52s)]
*  and its importance to the American State Department, you have the dual loyalty [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3143.92s)]
*  tropes being played out in a woke fashion by like Jake Tapper on CNN, you know, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3148.7599999999998s)]
*  because that's what it is when Jake Tapper says like, oh, you're going to [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3155.92s)]
*  you're going to a Hillel and protesting against [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3161.12s)]
*  or you're going to a synagogue and protesting against the state of Israel. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3164.4s)]
*  You're anti-Semitic. Yeah. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3166.84s)]
*  Devoid of context, that does come across as anti-Semitic. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3168.08s)]
*  But when you add the context, when you factor in the context of the situation, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3171.6400000000003s)]
*  when there is literally a real estate sale happening at the fucking synagogue [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3175.08s)]
*  that is selling off stolen Palestinian land in the fucking West Bank [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3180.2000000000003s)]
*  and that's what people are protesting, you're [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3186.36s)]
*  you're actively tying this this [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3190.1200000000003s)]
*  settler colonial enterprise that's currently doing a genocide [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3194.0s)]
*  to Judaism in the hearts and minds of many Americans [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3198.28s)]
*  who don't have any association with Jews at all. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3203.4s)]
*  Like they've never met a Jewish person and they think like, oh, yeah, they're [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3207.8s)]
*  they do run the media, I think. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3211.28s)]
*  I don't know. Also, it seems like they like killing babies. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3212.76s)]
*  That's how anti-Semitism explodes in this country. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3215.64s)]
*  I think there's one other country where there's like a context [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3218.04s)]
*  and this bend in the conversation feels relevant to bring up, which is in the UK, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3221.76s)]
*  where I think that the kind of [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3226.44s)]
*  like the racial and ethnic, like ethno-nationalist paranoia [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3229.92s)]
*  that is kind of rapidly consuming that country in a way slightly different to here. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3234.6400000000003s)]
*  Like they just had Suella Braverman, a woman of like, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3238.4s)]
*  I believe, Indian background, but who was previously home secretary, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3242.8s)]
*  who had just wrote this whole essay in, I think, The Telegraph, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3246.6000000000004s)]
*  British Big British paper about how like I'm British, but I would never call myself [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3250.0800000000004s)]
*  English because I know that that's like that's not, you know, I know where I'm from, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3254.88s)]
*  is essentially what she's saying. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3259.2000000000003s)]
*  And again, there is this like retreat that you see in a bunch of different big Western [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3260.6800000000003s)]
*  societies now to believing and affirming these like [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3264.44s)]
*  radically offensive and untrue, essentialist characterizations [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3268.92s)]
*  of how people are, you know, similar to what you're describing about like the idea [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3274.36s)]
*  that it's like, you know, it's like meeting a Muslim person and saying, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3278.08s)]
*  oh, yeah, like you must like you must love all that Sharia shit. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3280.92s)]
*  Like, you know, just in a in assumption, yes, that both people all relate [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3284.04s)]
*  to their backgrounds or religions and what have you. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3288.56s)]
*  The idea that like there is a version, a parody like carnival, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3290.2s)]
*  like funhouse mirror idea of like what the most like raw and true ideas [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3294.2799999999997s)]
*  of these national, you know, categories are. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3299.96s)]
*  And for Jew, it's Israeli and clear. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3303.3199999999997s)]
*  Evidently, you know, I and I would say, you know, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3305.44s)]
*  to emphasize your comparison, I do believe that for like Americans [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3307.56s)]
*  and many people in the West, for Muslim, it is ISIS. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3310.64s)]
*  Like that's the like kind of like pathetic logic [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3313.08s)]
*  that is increasingly become accepting in commonplace. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3317.0s)]
*  You know, it's it's a triumph of ignorance. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3320.52s)]
*  But then and then for us, you have Jewish organizations who like [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3323.12s)]
*  instead of being like, yeah, no, all Jewish people are not this thing. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3326.24s)]
*  They're all like, yes, Jewish people are connected to this thing and they reinforce it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3330.24s)]
*  And I think to go back, like, I think your point is, is that it is actually good [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3334.88s)]
*  for Israel, for Jews around the world to be afraid and to feel unsafe. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3338.72s)]
*  This is why, you know, they are blasting in their media [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3342.7999999999997s)]
*  footage of college campus protests, you know, everything from like [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3348.2799999999997s)]
*  what happened in Amsterdam, where they like kind of create an entire media frenzy. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3352.7999999999997s)]
*  That was so insane. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3357.7599999999998s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3358.44s)]
*  The ADL, like months after it was revealed [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3359.56s)]
*  to not be a pogrom and everyone was like, oops, my bad for like all the [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3363.16s)]
*  all the officials that had immediately rushed to say, I can't believe you. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3367.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, this is why we got to deal with all these Muslims. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3371.52s)]
*  I mean, they went straight for and like the woman whose video they were circulating. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3374.16s)]
*  She literally had a video of the Israeli soccer fans harassing Muslim cab. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3378.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't remember what the who the was actually. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3384.92s)]
*  Yeah, they were they were harassing locals and then they presented that as like [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3387.04s)]
*  locals are harassing these. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3391.24s)]
*  And she's like, hey, guys, Muslim hordes harassing Israeli [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3392.68s)]
*  fans who just gently wanted to watch a soccer game play out or whatever. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3396.08s)]
*  And it is that was insane. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3402.24s)]
*  The ADL came after me for that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3404.56s)]
*  They still months after everybody were like, yeah, my bad. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3406.44s)]
*  We kind of went a little crazy with it. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3409.8399999999997s)]
*  The ADL came after me to say, you know, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3411.3599999999997s)]
*  Twitch still hasn't done anything about their anti-Semitic content creator, Hassan, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3413.2799999999997s)]
*  who is, you know, who is denying the thing that didn't have. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3417.24s)]
*  Yeah. Who's who's not recognizing the Amsterdam pogrom that took place. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3420.96s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's psychotic. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3425.96s)]
*  It is psychotic. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3428.4s)]
*  And I mean, I think like it's that the whole point of that is to kind of keep [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3429.48s)]
*  people who are less informed about what's going on in this feeling of like, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3435.0s)]
*  you know, Israel might be kind of unsafe, but the rest of the world is way more [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3438.84s)]
*  unsafe for us. So we got to support this place because that's the only place we have. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3442.28s)]
*  And that I mean, it's devastating to me, honestly, to see the kind of [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3446.16s)]
*  the paranoia and the fear that that kind of promotes in certain parts of our [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3449.7999999999997s)]
*  communities. And the. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3453.12s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it is there ads now. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3454.96s)]
*  I mean, Yeshiva University, which is a large it's a you know, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3457.2s)]
*  it's a major university in New York City. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3460.24s)]
*  And like they have a medical school, I believe Howard Dean went there in a law [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3462.32s)]
*  school, Cardozo, that's really ranked, you know, it's a real university. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3465.88s)]
*  It's and they market they have billboards. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3469.36s)]
*  I saw one in Jersey that's about like a lot of anti-Semitism going on. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3473.84s)]
*  You know, you should, you know, you want to send your kids to a place that's safe [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3477.72s)]
*  to do the safe from that. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3480.48s)]
*  Send them to Yeshiva University and you see the same university, but you see like [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3481.92s)]
*  the same shit on TikTok. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3485.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I saw that TikTok, the little kids like in front of the laptop [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3486.6s)]
*  and they're like, oh, which school can I get into? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3490.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3492.6s)]
*  So they're so scary and anti-Semitic at the end of it is why you and it's like, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3493.48s)]
*  oh, is where I can go. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3497.64s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, there's like that's it. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3498.8399999999997s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3502.12s)]
*  The idea of like perpetuate like it's. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3503.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know where Jews are not safe? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3506.32s)]
*  The Upper East Side of New York. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3508.32s)]
*  Yeah. Like, what the fuck? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3510.52s)]
*  No, Morningside Heights now is a no go zone for Jews, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3512.2000000000003s)]
*  even though most of the Jews live there. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3516.48s)]
*  Don't talk about them. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3517.96s)]
*  You have to literally be schizophrenic if you to believe that. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3518.52s)]
*  Like that is the most insane. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3521.44s)]
*  That that pisses me off so much. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3523.88s)]
*  Think about how many conversations you and I had before we went to college [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3525.8s)]
*  about people who are like, listen, you're going to go to the campus. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3529.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And the people, they're going to be people there and the people, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3532.6000000000004s)]
*  they're going to say things and the things they say about Israel. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3535.16s)]
*  They're not going to be good. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3537.7999999999997s)]
*  And you've got to be ready. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3539.04s)]
*  You've got to go to work like the conditioning to like be waging [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3540.08s)]
*  like psychic pro-Israel combat on a campus. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3543.04s)]
*  I mean, like conditioning is a bit strong word, because I will say that, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3546.16s)]
*  like for most people who even receive this propaganda or receive this [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3549.3599999999997s)]
*  indoctrination, even if let's say they have ambiently pro-Israel attitudes, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3553.12s)]
*  you cannot. I think that like it's you. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3556.8799999999997s)]
*  It's a Sisyphean task to try and convince a population that like [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3559.44s)]
*  the American college experience is fundamentally like off and bad [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3563.6s)]
*  and wrong for Jews and unworkable. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3568.0s)]
*  Like it's just not believable based on the experience based on the facts. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3570.04s)]
*  Well, well, it is if you send a kid onto a college campus [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3575.12s)]
*  and say the existence of a Palestinian narrative and Palestinian protests [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3579.08s)]
*  means you are unsafe. Correct. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3583.2000000000003s)]
*  So right now, when students are arriving on campus and there is a very [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3584.7200000000003s)]
*  widespread pro-Palestinian movement, I think there are a lot of young [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3588.8s)]
*  Jews who come onto campus and like before they've even had the chance [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3592.92s)]
*  to unpack the brainwashing. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3597.04s)]
*  I mean, they do feel unsafe. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3598.84s)]
*  I remember feeling that way. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3600.48s)]
*  And it really took me a minute to be like, what is this thing? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3602.08s)]
*  And to have the space to kind of like learn about it and unpack it. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3605.16s)]
*  But I initially did feel like personally, I think as well, I always [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3607.56s)]
*  remember like the feeling like biting back the feeling or at least [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3612.32s)]
*  and eventually confronting it outright that like that this is like [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3615.6800000000003s)]
*  like that this is language that's targeting or demonizing or goes above [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3619.7200000000003s)]
*  and beyond what even I was opening my mind up to. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3622.76s)]
*  I definitely I totally remember that. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3625.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm also like, that's why I feel so strongly that this like [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3626.8s)]
*  this type of behavior from the American Jewish community, it's like actually [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3630.44s)]
*  abusive to children, like it is hurtful to Jewish young people to put them [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3633.0800000000004s)]
*  in a situation where they are like so deprived of actual information [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3636.92s)]
*  and they are put into a situation where they think they have to be these like [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3641.44s)]
*  soldiers for Israel, defending Israel as is carrying out a genocide. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3644.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, I really do. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3648.88s)]
*  Like, it's not to defend what any individual person who has probably done, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3650.12s)]
*  you know, horrible things to student protesters, like it's not to forgive [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3654.4s)]
*  any actions that young people take. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3657.56s)]
*  But I I do really sympathize with like the average, like the really [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3659.52s)]
*  extreme brainwashing that a lot of people arrive on college campuses with. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3663.84s)]
*  And I really hope that like they are finding people who can like help them [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3667.48s)]
*  leave and help them understand what they've been. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3671.68s)]
*  Let me tell you, let me tell you, Simone, from my own personal experience, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3674.44s)]
*  having a podcast with a person that I thought was very critical of the [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3679.44s)]
*  sometimes it goes in the opposite direction. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3686.32s)]
*  And, you know, I'm talking about Ethan Klein. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3689.8s)]
*  He we had we had a podcast together called Leftovers and the podcast, of course, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3692.68s)]
*  unceremoniously ended after October seven. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3696.48s)]
*  We did like two episodes after that. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3699.68s)]
*  And then the podcast ended. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3701.92s)]
*  And the reasons as to why it ended is, well, at the time, I thought it was [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3704.48s)]
*  because, you know, oh, Ethan doesn't want to talk about politics any longer. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3708.68s)]
*  But instead, it turned into this whole thing where he spent the [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3715.7999999999997s)]
*  remainder of the past, like, 17 months [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3720.12s)]
*  actively coming after me and increasing the pressure valve [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3723.64s)]
*  and also even successfully de platforming a couple smaller pro-Palestinian voices, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3728.08s)]
*  pro-Palestinian content creators [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3734.64s)]
*  by claiming that they had a Habibi tier list, like who has a Habibi past tier list? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3737.36s)]
*  And the bottom of the tier was Love's Sabra Hummus. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3742.84s)]
*  Oh, my God. And that was considered by the ADL and by Ethan Klein as the [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3745.88s)]
*  the peak of anti-Semitism. Yeah. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3752.04s)]
*  And they did. They successfully banned these content creators [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3754.28s)]
*  for 30 days off this platform. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3757.0s)]
*  One of the content creators was a Lebanese Jew as well. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3760.6400000000003s)]
*  The one who made the tier list was Jewish. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3763.7200000000003s)]
*  He was called a token and a terrorism supporter. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3767.52s)]
*  I've, of course, been endlessly called a [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3772.08s)]
*  terrorism supporter for contextualizing the ways in which militant resistance [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3775.6s)]
*  exists against the apartheid state. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3780.36s)]
*  And I guess the the the thing, the question I have is like, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3782.6800000000003s)]
*  is there any point where you can just like recover that? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3787.1200000000003s)]
*  Is there any point where someone who previously might have been critical, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3791.8s)]
*  but like post October 7 slowly but surely [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3794.88s)]
*  turned into someone who [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3798.04s)]
*  who became very overtly pro-Israel is like interested now in flying to Israel, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3802.0s)]
*  I believe, with his family and showing everybody [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3808.7200000000003s)]
*  how wonderful and how multifaceted and a multicultural of a society [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3813.6800000000003s)]
*  Israel is, then is actively spending all of his bandwidth [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3817.0s)]
*  talking about the issue of Israel, pass on was still simultaneously [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3821.08s)]
*  maintained in position that they are truly pro-Palestinian, by the way. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3824.24s)]
*  That's are you are you saying like, do you think he's ever going to come back? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3827.24s)]
*  Do you? Yeah. Is there any is there any way that you can like not you personally? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3829.9199999999996s)]
*  But is there any way that anyone can personally convince this person that like, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3834.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, they're they've lost their mind a little bit? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3838.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, I think. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3844.56s)]
*  I'm willing to look, I guess what I would say is like, I'm somebody [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3846.68s)]
*  I have to believe that the answer to that is yes, because I'm somebody [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3851.12s)]
*  who went through a political transformation. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3853.92s)]
*  It took me many years. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3855.56s)]
*  It took a lot of people talking to me, turning things over with me. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3856.6800000000003s)]
*  And it and people did move. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3860.08s)]
*  You know, I always say when I do these screenings on campuses, like, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3861.6s)]
*  you never know if the fight that you had with someone or the, you know, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3864.48s)]
*  the like three hour getting into it where they left and you were like, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3868.0s)]
*  damn, that person's never going to change. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3872.0s)]
*  You never know that like that conversation [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3873.32s)]
*  might be sitting in a person's head and really like percolating. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3875.56s)]
*  And like months later or even years later, they might come back and be like [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3878.4s)]
*  that person, that thing that you said really, really stuck with me. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3882.4s)]
*  I mean, that's what the work of political transformation is. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3884.64s)]
*  So that like that's one. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3886.56s)]
*  I think thing two is like, I do think that we are going to see [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3888.1600000000003s)]
*  in many years from now, a lot of people who defended [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3893.0s)]
*  what has been going on for the last year and a half who are going to wake up [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3896.4s)]
*  and have epiphanies, it's going to be because more reports come out. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3899.96s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of horrifying to think about everything we know [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3903.36s)]
*  about what's happened in Gaza over the last year and a half. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3905.96s)]
*  There are there is going to be [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3908.8s)]
*  there are going to be more reports that come out of people who have, you know, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3911.12s)]
*  actually go when people are finally able to go. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3914.3599999999997s)]
*  There's so much more. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3916.96s)]
*  We just know that there's so much more that's going to come out. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3917.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think that, of course, there are going to be people [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3920.12s)]
*  who are going to have breaking moments. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3924.24s)]
*  There is going to be something that's going to make them flip. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3926.08s)]
*  I think a lot of people right now who are out there in public, like [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3927.92s)]
*  have things gnawing at them. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3930.6s)]
*  You listen to what they're saying. It doesn't all make sense. Right. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3931.92s)]
*  I think the question of like what kind of accountability [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3935.64s)]
*  there should be for people like that, for somebody with a public platform [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3939.12s)]
*  who's done incredible harm, you know, what kind of actual repair [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3942.4s)]
*  they have to make. That's like a whole other [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3946.56s)]
*  that's like a whole other conversation to have. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3950.04s)]
*  But I just have no doubt that there are going to be people who are. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3951.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, there's that like new book. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3954.3599999999997s)]
*  I haven't gotten to read it yet, but there's that new book. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3955.7599999999998s)]
*  Like one day everybody's going to be against us. Right. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3957.3199999999997s)]
*  We're already seeing now like Trump all of a sudden says, you know, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3959.88s)]
*  he's going to build these villas in Gaza. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3962.7599999999998s)]
*  And all of a sudden, people are like, this is the most horrible idea [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3964.08s)]
*  I've ever heard of in my life, as if they haven't been witnessing [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3966.96s)]
*  an ethnic cleansing campaign underway for the last year and a half. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3969.32s)]
*  So I mean, think even just the fact that Trump is going to be [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3971.96s)]
*  stamping a lot of this means that you're going to have more and more people [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3974.88s)]
*  coming out and and being willing to say things. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3977.36s)]
*  And I would also say that like the only thing I if I have on a personal level, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3979.8s)]
*  I affirm everything Simone said, having also been somebody on the receiving end [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3983.36s)]
*  of those similar kinds of conversations and hoping that, you know, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3986.8s)]
*  the grace extended to me, I can extend to others in the right context. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3990.32s)]
*  But to that point, like I think somebody, though, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3995.04s)]
*  I think that people like you should also evaluate, like, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=3997.56s)]
*  how do people live and like, what are they hearing and what's in their ears [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4000.8799999999997s)]
*  and what context are they existing in? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4004.48s)]
*  And I think for people necessarily like who's talking about an Ethan, who, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4006.68s)]
*  you know, like they work themselves into a frenzy and they make it difficult. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4011.0s)]
*  They make it difficult for others to reach them. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4016.04s)]
*  And I don't think that, you know, that should necessarily change [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4019.12s)]
*  how one person acts that like, oh, yeah, like, will that person come into the fold? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4022.0s)]
*  Should I try and extend every effort to reach them? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4026.2s)]
*  I don't know. But it does mean that, like, yeah, we should extend like, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4028.08s)]
*  you know, the the hope, I guess, would be that like you can, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4031.52s)]
*  you know, inspire some change in a conversation with people. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4035.48s)]
*  But if they don't want to hear and they're unwilling to change, then they won't. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4038.08s)]
*  I would also just say, like, I'm more I mean, sounds like you got to deal [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4042.76s)]
*  with that relationship, but I'm I mean, that's just one. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4046.48s)]
*  That's like almost a placeholder, really. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4050.12s)]
*  Yeah. But I guess, like for me, I'm just like somebody like that at this point [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4052.8399999999997s)]
*  has like a personal stake in not changing because he's getting a lot of affirmation [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4055.72s)]
*  from his platform for. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4060.48s)]
*  And so like that's where you have to also be like this person's career is now tied to [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4061.72s)]
*  not changing his mind. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4067.3999999999996s)]
*  But there are a lot of people who listen to him, who who [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4068.72s)]
*  I think are worth speaking to. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4072.08s)]
*  And that's exactly perfect. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4074.0s)]
*  You you describe it perfectly. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4076.64s)]
*  That that is my that is my big frustration is is not this like singular individual [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4078.12s)]
*  who is is very narcissistic, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4084.72s)]
*  as most content creators are. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4088.56s)]
*  I'm certainly no, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4090.48s)]
*  I'm certainly not innocent of this either. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4093.3599999999997s)]
*  But it's not it's not the fact that this person like deeply personalized [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4095.92s)]
*  the resentment and the backlash that he was receiving from his own community [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4102.12s)]
*  as someone who had cultivated a very progressive community [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4106.0s)]
*  over the course of many years and then and then saw [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4109.2s)]
*  unimaginable amounts of feedback from said community because he kept saying things [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4113.76s)]
*  like Jewish voice for peace could be considered Kapos or, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4117.96s)]
*  you know, telling a [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4123.24s)]
*  a queer Muslim content creator that like, you know, enjoy Hamas, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4127.0s)]
*  like Hamas will kill you for doing drugs and being gay, you know, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4131.12s)]
*  go to Gaza and enjoy that. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4134.32s)]
*  Like when people see stuff like that, they understand that, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4135.44s)]
*  you know, this is coming from a place where you you have some unresolved [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4141.12s)]
*  contradictions in your mind about Israel. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4145.5599999999995s)]
*  And and you cannot like disassociate from Israel in a in a way that is meaningful. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4149.679999999999s)]
*  And then turning around and consistently saying like, well, all Jews are Zionists. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4155.96s)]
*  So if you're anti-Zionist, you're anti-Semitic, like [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4160.04s)]
*  repeating, you know, the classic propaganda points over and over again [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4164.28s)]
*  like that, that only built up a resentment in his own community. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4168.96s)]
*  And then looking for a way out and basically pointing the finger of blame at me [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4172.719999999999s)]
*  personally is, I think, the reason why, you know, in his mind, he's like, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4177.48s)]
*  I have to eliminate this person. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4182.679999999999s)]
*  I have to make sure that, you know, I have to prove to myself and everyone around me [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4184.88s)]
*  and maybe even the remainder of my audience that like it was him. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4189.88s)]
*  That is the reason why everyone turned on me. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4193.92s)]
*  He radicalized people into hating Israel and then radicalized them into anti-Semitism. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4196.4400000000005s)]
*  But he's one person. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4203.72s)]
*  It's it's inconsequential, but he has a relatively sizable, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4205.8s)]
*  progressive community of people who think that they're pro-Palestine, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4209.96s)]
*  but they actively spend all of their time [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4214.16s)]
*  smearing with vicious smears of anti-Semitism and terror baiting [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4217.76s)]
*  and claiming that everyone else who is a pro-Palestinian is [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4224.0s)]
*  everyone else is pro-Palestinian and not like him is. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4228.76s)]
*  But he supported the war and the genocide. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4231.84s)]
*  He he didn't. He is like gone back and forth on it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4235.4s)]
*  Initially, he did not at all. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4238.36s)]
*  But he just like has found this weird liberal [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4240.24s)]
*  Zionist position where he's like, oh, well, it is a genocide. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4243.52s)]
*  And, you know, it is it is fucked up. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4248.0s)]
*  It is the war. The war is messed up. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4250.8s)]
*  While simultaneously spending all. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4253.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. While simultaneously spending all of his time being like, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4255.4400000000005s)]
*  well, if the walls were to come down, then all Jews would be genocided. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4258.8s)]
*  Hassan wants all Jews because I'm a one state. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4262.96s)]
*  I'm an advocate for a one state solution. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4265.68s)]
*  I used to be an advocate for two state solution, but I think the [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4268.04s)]
*  the settlement project has completely eviscerated that [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4271.4800000000005s)]
*  from ever coming to fruition unless there is, you know, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4275.68s)]
*  an ethnic displacement now of 750,000 [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4280.2s)]
*  Jewish settlers from both East Jerusalem [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4284.5199999999995s)]
*  and also occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4287.5599999999995s)]
*  That that is impossible. Like, that's never going to happen. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4290.84s)]
*  So I think that the appropriate thing to do is is eradicate the apartheid. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4293.96s)]
*  And we'll hear. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4299.28s)]
*  Can I just say, please? Well, I just want to say one thing. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4301.4s)]
*  Like, I think that, again, I'm like, I can say I'm like [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4303.599999999999s)]
*  about a person who I don't really there's a stream of kind of liberals, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4307.799999999999s)]
*  liberal Zionism right now that is basically saying like [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4310.92s)]
*  what happened over there is bad and is sad, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4314.679999999999s)]
*  but we're not going to do anything about it. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4317.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's like there's a there's a kind of trope about Israeli [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4319.36s)]
*  discourse and literature, this idea of shooting and crying. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4323.639999999999s)]
*  So, you know, the idea that you kind of like support the thing that's happening, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4326.4s)]
*  you kill Palestinians, but then you turn around and you cry about it. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4330.5199999999995s)]
*  You feel bad about it. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4333.2s)]
*  And I think we should like, obviously, like very actively resist, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4334.44s)]
*  especially in a moment in which there's like an ongoing genocide. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4339.36s)]
*  That kind of it's not just like [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4342.44s)]
*  just a really harmful way of thinking. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4346.5599999999995s)]
*  And I hear this all the time from liberal Zionist commentators [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4348.919999999999s)]
*  and individuals that I follow where they're like, you know, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4352.879999999999s)]
*  we supported the war, but not like this or, you know, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4355.879999999999s)]
*  there's a there's a podcast that is like a kind of niche [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4359.32s)]
*  Jewish community podcast that I sometimes listen to to understand [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4363.599999999999s)]
*  what kind of idiocy people in my community are hearing. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4367.28s)]
*  And there was a conversation where their reflection on the Trump [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4370.599999999999s)]
*  the Trump announcement about ethnically cleansing the entire population of Gaza. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4375.4s)]
*  First of all, started out by the one of the commentators saying, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4380.88s)]
*  well, I mean, would it be nice if I could wake up one day [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4384.92s)]
*  and there were no Palestinians in Gaza? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4388.0s)]
*  I mean, sure. But, you know, that's horrible. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4389.6s)]
*  And then the other guy in the podcast was like, oh, that's the Israeli [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4392.96s)]
*  and you talking here is on the Hartman podcast. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4395.88s)]
*  Oh, I remember. I remember this. I remember this bad. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4398.16s)]
*  And it's like and then they went on to say, you know, that would be so terrible. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4401.0s)]
*  But again, they're still talking about it in the context of like, we support it. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4406.44s)]
*  We're not going to do anything to stop it. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4411.0s)]
*  Anybody who's calling for accountability, anyone who's calling for [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4412.36s)]
*  anyone who's calling for halting of weapons to Israel, the ICC, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4416.48s)]
*  like all of these international institutions calling all of them anti-Semitic. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4421.08s)]
*  And so then what does it leave you with? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4424.28s)]
*  Like you say you're against the thing, but you're all you're also against [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4426.24s)]
*  anybody who's going to do anything to try to stop it and to offer something different. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4429.599999999999s)]
*  But I don't think that that is any, you know, I think a lot of people in the [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4433.719999999999s)]
*  movement would say, I would just rather the honesty of someone who's saying [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4438.12s)]
*  they support the ethnic cleansing than somebody who says, well, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4441.88s)]
*  you know, maybe I'm against, but will like kind of waffle that hard [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4446.12s)]
*  and keep people confused and complacent. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4450.04s)]
*  Yeah. And and I do want to stress the importance of like [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4452.0s)]
*  the way that I think a lot of people do this in like relatively progressive circles [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4456.28s)]
*  or liberal circles is by always reshifting the attention back to October 7. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4460.5199999999995s)]
*  Not in the same way that like the, you know, oh, I hope your beeper is [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4466.44s)]
*  beeping enjoyers, but instead reshifting it back to like the trauma [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4470.88s)]
*  and the atrocities of October 7 over and over again and constantly [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4475.92s)]
*  re litigating that and also spreading misinformation in the process as well. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4480.44s)]
*  Like, you know, mass rapes that took place or any number of different things [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4485.92s)]
*  that they say that has not been substantiated thus far. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4491.84s)]
*  And and, you know, actively saying like you're a rape denier, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4496.92s)]
*  you're a rape denier over and over again and and hyper focusing on [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4500.0s)]
*  the the militancy aspect of those who are resisting against a settler, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4505.28s)]
*  colonial occupying force that has under international law, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4509.72s)]
*  no right to go into Gaza and bomb it into oblivion as a belligerent occupier. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4514.48s)]
*  And I don't know, I don't know how to bring people back from that position [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4520.56s)]
*  when they constantly turn around and and just go back to like, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4525.88s)]
*  well, the Ansar Allah movement is bad. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4530.68s)]
*  The Hamas is bad. Hezbollah is bad. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4533.0s)]
*  Like, how how dare you say that like these people have an understandable [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4534.68s)]
*  need for emancipation? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4539.72s)]
*  And of course, there is an inevitability to like, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4541.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, militancy happening as a direct consequence of like [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4545.28s)]
*  endless bombing campaigns that orphan hundreds of thousands of children. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4549.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that there is like embedded in all this [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4555.2s)]
*  and sort of like a like what is implied by acknowledging [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4559.4s)]
*  like the horrors of what's going on and that it's really bad. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4563.16s)]
*  But cannot but the thing that they can't like that is acknowledged [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4566.799999999999s)]
*  implicitly in that, but that they can't express is the idea that then like, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4569.5599999999995s)]
*  well, what reaction might this engender in the people that we do this to? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4574.0s)]
*  And then comes the fear and the overriding fear of like, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4579.799999999999s)]
*  well, what might they do to us if we were ever under the same roof, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4584.24s)]
*  roof in like one one community, one state, whatever the arrangement is. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4587.12s)]
*  And I think that there is a you know, I don't think I I think that this is [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4590.96s)]
*  an actively repressed sensation and thought for some people. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4594.8s)]
*  I think it's just something that others may just feel in their body, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4598.08s)]
*  the knowledge that like, well, if I do believe that this thing is really bad, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4600.88s)]
*  but I'm not really able to articulate anything, you know, against it, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4605.28s)]
*  then there is, you know, the knowledge like this, like sort of, you know, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4609.24s)]
*  this like sort of dangling over you that, you know, that like, well, one day, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4612.72s)]
*  like these people may deal to us the unkindnesses that we've dealt to them, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4617.08s)]
*  which is not what I believe, to be clear, like, I don't believe that there's like [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4621.72s)]
*  some Palestinian pain being welted, dealt back to the Jews or like, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4624.76s)]
*  it's not the line. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4628.12s)]
*  History has never that's never happened throughout history either. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4628.92s)]
*  With like, I guess the exception maybe of the well, even in the Haitian Revolution, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4633.2s)]
*  I would say there's a bunch of people love telling lies about saying, like, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4637.72s)]
*  oh, in Algeria, they went to murder all the different, but it's not how it works. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4640.64s)]
*  But like, the anxiety is part of what I think is there and that there is like this, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4644.320000000001s)]
*  you know, some people say, like, I'm afraid that like all the Jews are going to die [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4649.0s)]
*  or all the like, whatever, like that's what they're speaking to. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4651.56s)]
*  And I personally, I don't know how you unlearn that or unteach that in a [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4654.120000000001s)]
*  individual person. Yeah. But I know that like, you know, encouraging the human, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4657.72s)]
*  encouraging the humanity as a broad, encouraging humanity as a broad practice [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4661.68s)]
*  is like how you undermine it by showing that like, no, these are fucking normal [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4665.64s)]
*  people who want to live normal lives and they're not raring to go to like chop [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4669.2s)]
*  your head off. They want dignity. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4672.4s)]
*  Yeah. The the the reason why I dialed it back as soon as I said the Haitian [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4673.88s)]
*  Revolution is because like in the after during the Haitian Revolution, yes, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4677.5599999999995s)]
*  there was a lot of violence, but the retaliation for it from colonial power, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4681.08s)]
*  once again, tenfold back to Haiti and the current predicament that Haiti is in [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4684.72s)]
*  is a direct consequence of that. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4689.48s)]
*  So even in the Haitian Revolution, it still did not that did not take place. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4691.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I always draw parallels to the Nat Turner rebellion or the or the [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4696.2s)]
*  violence that took place during the resistance against the South African [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4701.04s)]
*  apartheid or the liberation struggle for Algerians or the Warsaw ghetto uprising, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4704.6s)]
*  which I think is a really is a really decent analog. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4711.6s)]
*  And yet I do think that it's just like impossible for people to penetrate. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4714.96s)]
*  It's impossible for me to penetrate the the security blanket that they create [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4719.16s)]
*  around these racist opinions that like, no, no matter what these guys are [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4723.52s)]
*  violent, they're rabid. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4729.400000000001s)]
*  I won't say it out loud that I feel that they're violent and rabid, but I am still [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4730.64s)]
*  scared that they are violent, rabid and anti-Semitic. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4734.8s)]
*  And it's just like impossible to shake through that, that like these are normal [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4738.76s)]
*  people who have been fucked over time and time again in incredibly meaningful ways [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4742.56s)]
*  in ways that have ruined their lives in ways that would break the soul of any [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4747.0s)]
*  person. And yet they've still demonstrated resilience. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4751.32s)]
*  And on top of that, have have throughout time reacted [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4754.599999999999s)]
*  to the extreme cruelty that Israel subjects them to and have increasingly [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4761.16s)]
*  become more militant as a consequence of that. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4767.12s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4769.92s)]
*  I just don't know how to like get that across to people, because the moment that [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4771.599999999999s)]
*  you open up this conversation, I think they they just go, no, you're a terrorist. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4774.88s)]
*  You're an Islamist fundamentalist. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4780.04s)]
*  You love ISIS. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4782.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's like a level of complexity that like, I mean, first of [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4783.8s)]
*  all, you know, we talk we talk a lot about how this is like the most the first [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4788.32s)]
*  live stream genocide in history. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4791.64s)]
*  I think sometimes I have moments where like the most kind of humble part of me is [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4793.08s)]
*  like, it is crazy to live through this and to be making sense of it in real time [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4796.84s)]
*  on the Internet. We're just like this much discourse about history happening in [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4801.52s)]
*  front of you is like something that's hard to do. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4805.68s)]
*  So like, honestly, respect that you are doing all of this right now. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4807.76s)]
*  I think that like, I mean, you know, I tweeted on October 7th something about [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4811.96s)]
*  how anybody who's been watching this situation could expect that it was going [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4818.12s)]
*  to explode and was warning that it was going to explode. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4822.4800000000005s)]
*  And people went crazy at me for saying that. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4825.12s)]
*  And I think that, again, it's it's a level of both like humility and complexity [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4827.68s)]
*  that you have to hold to be able to say like this situation, the Israeli [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4835.48s)]
*  apartheid, what Palestinians live under every day is something that no human [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4841.28s)]
*  being should ever be subjected to ever. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4844.599999999999s)]
*  And the the siege of Gaza, which has been happening for almost 20 years [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4847.24s)]
*  before this war, already you had reports of things like suicide rates among kids [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4852.639999999999s)]
*  being through the roof. Right. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4859.36s)]
*  The kind of the inhumanity that people are subjected to their not being able to [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4861.320000000001s)]
*  go see your family for a funeral or for a wedding, having to get the army's [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4866.8s)]
*  permit to go see your relatives who live in the West Bank. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4870.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, these were like these were the daily realities of, you know, not being [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4872.52s)]
*  able to get the materials that you need for the proper dental filling, like [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4876.360000000001s)]
*  not getting building permits in the West Bank, like having 98 percent of them [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4880.120000000001s)]
*  being denied now, 100 percent. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4882.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, all of this are like basic rights that human beings have to life [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4885.04s)]
*  and to family that Israel denies from Palestinians and has denied from [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4891.200000000001s)]
*  Palestinians every single day for decades. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4896.6s)]
*  This is like why it makes people crazy that the kind of reality depicted in [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4898.84s)]
*  Israel ism all happens before October 7th. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4902.360000000001s)]
*  And it's a really, I think, inconvenient argument to people who want the apartheid [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4905.160000000001s)]
*  to continue that when we say apartheid makes everybody who lives there less safe. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4911.5199999999995s)]
*  This whole situation endangers everybody who lives there and they don't like that. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4916.12s)]
*  And that's why they accuse us of just being, you know, they just kind of brush [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4920.4s)]
*  it all with like, you know, terrorist supporters, justifiers. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4924.28s)]
*  No, we're actually people who are trying to understand the situation so that we [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4926.679999999999s)]
*  can end it, so that we can envision a different reality in which all people [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4929.719999999999s)]
*  there would be safe with rights and freedom and all that. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4933.04s)]
*  And they they don't want that because they want the apartheid to continue. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4936.0s)]
*  Yeah, there is this from from Mohammed Al-Saffin on Chapo, where he said that [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4939.96s)]
*  an entire generation of Palestinians have never even set eyes on an Israeli and [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4948.599999999999s)]
*  knows them only by the bombs and sniper bullets they send by denials of requests [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4951.5599999999995s)]
*  to seek life saving medical care. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4955.16s)]
*  Israel's Israelis have dehumanized themselves. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4957.32s)]
*  And there is there is some truth to that. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4961.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, rest empowered to ref out Al-Raid, who also had said something similar [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4963.5599999999995s)]
*  the first time he ever met Jewish people who were anti-Zionist was was when he [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4968.6s)]
*  left Gaza and he came to the United States of America, I think, where he saw [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4974.160000000001s)]
*  that like that Jews in the way that he understood it from his own lived [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4981.64s)]
*  experiences wasn't about just like slapping a star of David on the side of a [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4987.360000000001s)]
*  tank or a fighter jet and then like sending bombs to his house or or killing [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=4993.36s)]
*  loved ones and that there were actually there were actually Jews out there who [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5001.2s)]
*  weren't a part of this like monolithic force in the way that they interpreted it. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5007.28s)]
*  And I think that Americans, especially have progressive Americans, especially [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5011.639999999999s)]
*  have this understanding that like radicalization only happens in like online [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5018.28s)]
*  forums when you don't have access to your favorite Twinkie for the weekend or [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5022.52s)]
*  I don't know, like when you can't eat burger and they don't realize that like [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5027.4800000000005s)]
*  this like what Americans or what the Western world perceives as anti-Semitism [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5032.6s)]
*  on that side of the fucking planet is not the same as like Nick Fuentes. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5038.96s)]
*  Nick Fuentes has invented some kind of a Jewish supremacist attitude that he [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5043.64s)]
*  has invented this perception of victimhood as Nazis had before him time [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5051.36s)]
*  and time again, especially in the Western world. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5057.04s)]
*  But for the Arab world, Israel packages its actions as Judaism, as doing so for [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5059.4s)]
*  at the behest of Judaism, falsely doing so, of course, and as a settler, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5069.16s)]
*  colonial enterprise, when it engages in these violent actions like, yeah, people [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5075.32s)]
*  don't hate people there, don't hate Jewish people. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5081.16s)]
*  They learn to hate Israel. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5084.92s)]
*  And Israel to them is just Judaism. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5087.08s)]
*  That's that's the only expression of Judaism that they see. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5090.04s)]
*  And I cannot explain that to Westerners in general, who just will see, will go [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5093.24s)]
*  and go Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5099.759999999999s)]
*  That's it. Like that's that's it's a thought terminating term that people, I think, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5101.5599999999995s)]
*  uses a mantra almost to basically say, no, Hamas, the terrorist group. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5107.12s)]
*  No, these people are these people are violent. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5112.6s)]
*  Like they just like tell that to themselves in order to justify [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5114.68s)]
*  not hearing the words that are coming out of my fucking mouth. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5118.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would just I was thinking there's this book called Our American Israel [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5121.28s)]
*  that actually is being re-released on paperback pretty soon. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5126.360000000001s)]
*  I would really recommend it for people who are interested in [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5130.56s)]
*  learning more about the kind of shared mythology between the US and Israel [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5133.639999999999s)]
*  and how like so much of how we think about Israel in the US is also about [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5137.679999999999s)]
*  how Americans want to perceive themselves and so much of the like [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5142.16s)]
*  the kind of racist war on terror language, like all of that. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5145.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like it's very much like a joint Israeli American project. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5148.759999999999s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, I think just yeah, the thing that you said, like that [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5153.44s)]
*  totally flipped my world upside down. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5157.5599999999995s)]
*  Also, the first time I met someone in the West Bank who was like [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5158.92s)]
*  the only Jews we ever see are soldiers and settlers like [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5161.04s)]
*  and I think for me, that's it's another. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5165.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's the book. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5167.16s)]
*  I it's it's a good read. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5167.92s)]
*  You read it? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5169.64s)]
*  I have not. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5170.8s)]
*  Our American Israel, the story of an entangled alliance by Amy Kaplan. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5171.76s)]
*  Slaps. Yeah, there it is. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5177.44s)]
*  I'm just reading it right now. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5179.56s)]
*  Terminator, another YouTuber, I like [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5181.32s)]
*  I like calls them everlasting thought stoppers. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5183.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's simply what it is. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5187.0s)]
*  It's just like, make sure you don't show your phone, by the way, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5188.84s)]
*  to the camera, but just keep it low. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5192.16s)]
*  Oh, nice. What happens if it's. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5194.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5197.28s)]
*  The the term thought terminating cliche was invented to explain cults. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5199.56s)]
*  No, it is. It is cultish thinking. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5203.12s)]
*  Zionism is Zionism creates cultish thinking. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5205.32s)]
*  It also it makes you not consider anything like context, like, you know, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5209.04s)]
*  for example, like, you know who South Africa, the state of South Africa, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5213.64s)]
*  also called terrorists in official state language for like the entirety [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5216.8s)]
*  of their existence, the ANC. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5220.24s)]
*  And, you know, the ANC committed acts of violence. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5222.28s)]
*  Yes. But that wasn't why South Africa called them terrorists. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5224.320000000001s)]
*  It wasn't why they called Swapo and maybe a terrorist. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5227.88s)]
*  They had a righteous cause. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5230.16s)]
*  Exactly. You know, it's again, it's because they had a cause at all. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5231.28s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's, you know, like, you know, you know, there probably are like [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5234.56s)]
*  there probably are people out there with a cause. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5239.04s)]
*  I don't disagree. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5240.6s)]
*  Point being, though, that like in this instance, it is evidently clear [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5241.4400000000005s)]
*  that if you have, you know, again, like if there is anything that resembles [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5244.68s)]
*  a context to those words, that if they've been said by other people [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5248.0s)]
*  in similar contexts before, you don't know that you just, you know, it's [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5251.52s)]
*  it's not like a that's [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5256.280000000001s)]
*  that would break the thought terminating function. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5260.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I think that's why it's important to whitewash [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5263.56s)]
*  former revolutionary figures that have now been appropriated into like [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5267.92s)]
*  the permissible structure of [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5272.12s)]
*  a liberal interpretation of history that fall into the good, bad dynamic. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5276.04s)]
*  That's why it's important to say that Nelson Mandela abhorred violence [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5279.88s)]
*  when it's literally a historic, the most a historical thing that you can say. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5284.2s)]
*  Nelson Mandela, who was, of course, famously in the in the terror watchlist [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5288.84s)]
*  until 2008, the American terrorist watchlist. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5293.6s)]
*  Nelson Mandela, who like neocons and right wing in this country, hated. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5297.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, for among other things, embracing Fidel Castro [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5301.24s)]
*  because of Cuba's role in ending apartheid. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5304.16s)]
*  But I mean, it is like I think the terrorism piece of it is also like, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5305.96s)]
*  you know, look at who gets called a terrorist in this country domestically [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5310.4800000000005s)]
*  these days. And I think increasingly, look, if somebody does have like a [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5313.72s)]
*  a notionally and nominally like liberal political consciousness, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5319.24s)]
*  like I do believe that in rhetoric, those kinds of similarities [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5322.84s)]
*  are only going to increasingly become more stark. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5326.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5330.08s)]
*  I mean, Luigi, also a terrorist, remember. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5331.04s)]
*  But in terms of things changing, let's talk about this. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5335.24s)]
*  Gallup poll shows US sympathies shifting in the Middle East among Democrats. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5340.04s)]
*  Fifty nine percent sympathize more with Palestinians compared to 21 with Israel. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5343.84s)]
*  Insane. That is a fucking insane change of attitude. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5348.88s)]
*  That's a general. That is a generational shift. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5352.92s)]
*  Look at this. Look at this. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5354.96s)]
*  Look at where it was. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5356.84s)]
*  It was in the high tens to low 20s, almost in perpetuity. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5358.68s)]
*  And then what happens? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5364.16s)]
*  What happens like around this this time frame? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5366.16s)]
*  I'll tell you what happens. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5369.4400000000005s)]
*  As much as I criticize these NGOs from time to time [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5371.4400000000005s)]
*  for playing a formative role in American imperialism, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5375.400000000001s)]
*  they actively say Israel is an apartheid. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5379.76s)]
*  OK, it's right around the same time where Israel [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5383.280000000001s)]
*  sieges Gaza and the Great Wall of Return, a great march of return as well. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5386.04s)]
*  So Great March of Return, Israel, Israel, siege on Gaza again. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5389.04s)]
*  The bombing of the Associated Press building, the assassination of Shirin [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5393.76s)]
*  Abu Akhlaq and and the occupation of Sheikh Jarrah. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5397.8s)]
*  All of that, along with. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5402.4s)]
*  These NGOs coming out and saying [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5405.92s)]
*  Israel is an apartheid state, it is like they correctly finally [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5409.48s)]
*  exhibited the bravery to say the truth. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5414.52s)]
*  And I think in that process, as also alternative media was growing as well. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5417.64s)]
*  And there was a more independent thought in this issue [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5422.8s)]
*  and that people could have access directly to the Palestinians [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5426.360000000001s)]
*  who could speak on their own personal plight. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5429.76s)]
*  We got to this point where 59 percent of Democrats [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5433.16s)]
*  are now more sympathetic to the Palestinians. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5437.72s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5441.76s)]
*  It also I will say, like if you look at that graph, like the trend line initiates [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5442.52s)]
*  downward, like in a meaningful sense, like before October 7th, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5446.72s)]
*  it accelerates way afterward to be clear. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5450.040000000001s)]
*  We see the big drop there. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5452.160000000001s)]
*  But I think it's worth emphasizing that it is like this was an acceleration [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5453.68s)]
*  of a trajectory that like I think Simone and I definitely would. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5458.040000000001s)]
*  I feel like we were we sensed and were conscious of when we were in college. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5460.72s)]
*  You know, it's it was you could sense that a dam was breaking [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5465.240000000001s)]
*  and that it was in a long generational lines, especially that it was [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5469.240000000001s)]
*  just increasingly difficult for people who didn't have like inherited dogmas [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5472.48s)]
*  around this if they're not Jewish and identifies Democrats to like [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5476.44s)]
*  justify any piece of what they were reading in the news. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5480.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, also like these numbers on American Jews are also moving like crazy. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5483.36s)]
*  Astonishingly. Yeah. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5487.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, less than half in the US now sympathetic towards Israelis. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5490.24s)]
*  Damn. I will say that's a crazy way to phrase that, just because it's like [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5494.839999999999s)]
*  not like a like a just a it's just kind of funny, like they're not sympathetic [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5500.2s)]
*  to Israelis. They see an Israeli down walking the street and they say, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5504.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't have much sympathy for him. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5507.36s)]
*  It just is a funny way of phrasing it to me. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5509.04s)]
*  Yeah. Also, that also has the underlying assumption of like secret anti-Semitism [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5511.16s)]
*  baked into it, baked in the collective conscience of people who are, you know, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5517.5599999999995s)]
*  liberal or progressive. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5521.24s)]
*  That's why, because if anybody fucking said that about like French people, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5522.639999999999s)]
*  no one would be like, oh, I don't give a shit. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5526.36s)]
*  Yeah, fuck the French. You know what I mean? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5528.32s)]
*  Or British people. But because it's Israel and Israel has packaged itself [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5529.88s)]
*  as the Jewish state over and over again in perpetuity as it as it [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5533.799999999999s)]
*  continues to do untold amounts of war crimes and and terror that, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5538.799999999999s)]
*  you know, this this simultaneously plays a role in people being like, well, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5545.24s)]
*  that's that's a little scary. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5549.32s)]
*  I you know, I don't see any relationship between the headline and the subhead [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5550.88s)]
*  there. I think those are [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5554.44s)]
*  independent Palestinian state remains at majority level. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5557.04s)]
*  What do those two things have to do with each other? [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5559.76s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5561.68s)]
*  But that is going back to the previous thing that I was saying, though, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5562.88s)]
*  is like there is this underlying fear of the of the [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5566.44s)]
*  the the same exact fear that like the historic oppressors have always felt [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5570.8s)]
*  and is an unjustifiable fear to have that like they will do to us [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5576.12s)]
*  what we've done to them. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5579.44s)]
*  And like you admitted or like you mentioned, sorry, there's an admission there [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5580.76s)]
*  of like we are doing to them something very bad, which I never say out loud, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5585.44s)]
*  but we are doing something bad to them. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5589.4s)]
*  And and while it's while it's never happened throughout history, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5592.16s)]
*  this is this is the fear. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5596.599999999999s)]
*  And that's why so many people who say that they're pro-Palestinians still try to [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5597.919999999999s)]
*  still try to to draw the conversation back to like, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5603.2s)]
*  oh, I do want a two state solution, knowing full welded that will never come [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5606.719999999999s)]
*  to fruition. And and and simultaneously claim that like [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5610.36s)]
*  anyone who's a one state or is actually demanding the the Holocaust [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5614.44s)]
*  to happen again to all the Jews in Israel. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5619.28s)]
*  It's a fucking psychotic thing to say. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5621.08s)]
*  And yet so many people maintain this position. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5624.4s)]
*  And I don't know how to, you know, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5626.839999999999s)]
*  I'm away from this like insane perspective that they maintain. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5628.919999999999s)]
*  And I mean, I think the big one is, I mean, I think like the facts [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5633.08s)]
*  are on your side and just that it's like it's not what oppressed people do. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5636.2s)]
*  It's not historically how it bears out in that, like, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5639.16s)]
*  you know, if anything, like a far worse and more dangerous and far more reckless [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5643.2s)]
*  of a situation would be to create two separate political national categories, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5647.48s)]
*  two different states, put them next to each other and thus make their interests [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5652.16s)]
*  divergent to like separate a common like reality for them. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5655.76s)]
*  Like is actually like it's it's not doing that at all. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5659.92s)]
*  That's an illusion. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5662.8s)]
*  It creates a new common reality in which like they remain pit against each other. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5663.72s)]
*  I just have never felt that like the idea like once the switch [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5667.599999999999s)]
*  flipped for me that like two states were both unworkable, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5671.84s)]
*  like the moral force of that of an argument for it also started to like seem [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5674.92s)]
*  like it also dissipated for me over the years. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5680.12s)]
*  And it's felt like a way of like a like a [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5682.360000000001s)]
*  yeah, like a like a cop out of just saying like we can't trust Palestinians [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5686.0s)]
*  to live peacefully. Yeah, that's embedded in it. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5689.28s)]
*  I mean, I think also when you're like, I don't know how we do this. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5691.68s)]
*  I mean, the polling shows that we are doing it right. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5694.12s)]
*  I mean, the these numbers have been shifting incrementally, like [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5696.6s)]
*  more and more people are waking up. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5700.84s)]
*  And I think the fact that we're like continuing to kind of like [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5702.36s)]
*  debunk the argument and put forth something different, like we're seeing that [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5706.719999999999s)]
*  it's resonating with more and more people. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5710.88s)]
*  And so like I think even the fact that we're like still having these conversations is [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5712.32s)]
*  it can feel really tiring and I mean, I will also say like [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5716.04s)]
*  because I did the Theo Vonn show this week and like the Theo Vonn interview [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5719.5199999999995s)]
*  with Gabor Maté, I don't know if you've seen it, but like the over is a Trump's [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5723.639999999999s)]
*  like inauguration and he does this interview with Gabor Maté [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5727.44s)]
*  where it's like it's like it breaks through on camera, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5731.719999999999s)]
*  like just like what the experience of a child in Gaza must be, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5735.639999999999s)]
*  like what his life must have been, like what his dreams must be [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5739.24s)]
*  and what they can't be and things like that. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5742.36s)]
*  And it's, you know, like like the truth breaks, you know, in the right context, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5744.599999999999s)]
*  in the right moment, in the right mechanism, like the truth can break through to anybody [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5748.16s)]
*  in that way because we are all human and we all do, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5751.2s)]
*  even in our worst capacity, possess the ability to imagine and visualize [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5755.12s)]
*  and feel what life might be like for other people. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5759.6s)]
*  And that naturally is a comparison you make for yourself. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5762.92s)]
*  And it's devastating. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5765.2s)]
*  And, you know, that's what a conscience is, at least to me. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5766.52s)]
*  Yeah. And unfortunately, the people who are actually in power [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5769.8s)]
*  and in this country and in Israel, like they just want to keep making things worse [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5773.44s)]
*  and make people more and more people feel unsafe. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5777.68s)]
*  And I think that you are hearing actually more and more admissions of like [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5779.56s)]
*  there is, if you listen closely to the discourse, there is the admission [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5783.240000000001s)]
*  that they know what what they've done to Palestinians. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5786.160000000001s)]
*  They say it even sometimes, right? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5788.68s)]
*  We did the Nakba never happened, but careful, we're going to do it again. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5791.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's that's a constant. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=5793.88s)]

*  a troubling sign of a deeply unwell society. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6177.36s)]
*  OK, like just imagine they're American. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6181.04s)]
*  OK, please. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6184.5599999999995s)]
*  If you have any I mean, this is the this is a community. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6186.08s)]
*  This is a community that gets it. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6189.839999999999s)]
*  I would say like one way to put it, though, is like, what is it that's like about coming [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6191.24s)]
*  apart? It's not that like, oh, it's just that like the police are beating these people [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6194.799999999999s)]
*  up because like we've obviously have plenty of videos of like American police beating [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6197.919999999999s)]
*  people up for doing nothing in a room or whatever. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6201.64s)]
*  But I think what what's kind of nuts about this is that like that these people are not [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6203.6s)]
*  given like the equivalent of like sitting in the gallery at the State of the Union, [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6208.160000000001s)]
*  anything October 7th related suggests that they have a political crisis and a social [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6211.84s)]
*  crisis that is tearing the country apart and turning these people into objects of hate [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6217.280000000001s)]
*  by the government itself. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6221.64s)]
*  That's like the you know, which leads to situations like this. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6223.200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6225.92s)]
*  And the reason why I always like bring this back to America is because a lot this is me [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6227.04s)]
*  talking to the liberal Zionists, basically the liberal Zionists that live in the United [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6235.4800000000005s)]
*  States of America that still have some progressive values they maintain and haven't turned [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6239.280000000001s)]
*  into Michael Rapoport. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6246.12s)]
*  And they look to, you know, they look to stuff like this and think this is simply a [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6248.12s)]
*  byproduct of Benjamin Netanyahu not recognizing that there is a much larger problem. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6252.76s)]
*  OK, this is identical to conditions worsening in the United States of America as the [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6258.08s)]
*  American police and the American military become more aggressive towards civilians who [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6265.04s)]
*  have an understandable gripe and a reason to demand an adequate investigation, an [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6269.64s)]
*  independent investigation into the actions that caused their family members to die. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6276.4400000000005s)]
*  OK, why would a government say, no, we're not going to do that? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6282.88s)]
*  OK, why would they do that if a 9-11 style situation occurred again in the United States [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6286.72s)]
*  of America and the family members are like, wait a minute, there's something really weird [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6293.280000000001s)]
*  about this. Can we look into it? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6296.400000000001s)]
*  And the American military and American police were beating the shit out of those families. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6298.4800000000005s)]
*  Let's be clear, like there were a bunch of those families in the US. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6302.0s)]
*  They just got ignored, which is like what at least in Israel's case, like, I mean, part [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6304.320000000001s)]
*  of the problem is that like a point to the schism in this is that there's a bunch of [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6309.08s)]
*  people in Israel who like maybe that, you know, like however they feel about the campaign [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6313.08s)]
*  in Gaza and all this other stuff, like what they meaning that they're probably for it. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6317.0s)]
*  But that like on the point of like they don't want to see violence against the hostages [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6320.5599999999995s)]
*  or whatever. But, you know, there's I mean, that to me is like what's what seems [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6324.6s)]
*  that like it's evidence of how this stuff just gets politicized. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6329.72s)]
*  It's like, oh, people do care about it. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6332.44s)]
*  They let them get hit. Yeah. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6334.16s)]
*  Like try and show that like you don't care that they have people that care about them [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6336.12s)]
*  or whatever. It's a dissent that doesn't matter. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6339.84s)]
*  Genuine, genuine, honest and a bit pessimistic question. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6342.64s)]
*  Do you genuinely or hardly believe anything good will come out regarding Palestine as a [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6344.96s)]
*  person with family and friends in the region? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6348.0s)]
*  This has been the case for decades. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6349.64s)]
*  Nothing new. Just another cycle with a one thousand to one kill ratio and no progress. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6350.92s)]
*  Yes, I do. I definitely do. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6355.32s)]
*  And I think part of that is because the contradiction is the contradictions worsen as you [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6358.44s)]
*  see stuff like this happen in Israel, as you see the Israeli economy crumble, as you [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6362.16s)]
*  see the benefits go away, the benefits of being a [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6366.68s)]
*  Western adjacent nation go away for the average Israeli citizens slowly but surely, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6371.8s)]
*  they will leave Israel. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6378.28s)]
*  This is why I regularly maintain the position that the greatest threat to Israel is not [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6379.84s)]
*  Hamas or Iran. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6384.4s)]
*  The greatest threat to Israel is Sherman Oaks. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6386.12s)]
*  The greatest threat to Israel is Beverly Hills. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6388.2s)]
*  The greatest threat to Israel is Boca Raton. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6389.68s)]
*  OK, because if a lot of the people that live in Israel go, why the fuck am I still here? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6391.68s)]
*  I don't get any to listen to the worst psytrance music anyone has ever heard and wear my [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6397.92s)]
*  capri pants in Boca Raton. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6402.200000000001s)]
*  They're just going to go to Boca Raton. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6404.52s)]
*  OK, and you're also you're also going to lose like you're going to inevitably lose like [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6406.64s)]
*  a lot of the a lot of the academic resources that you have, like you're going to have [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6414.28s)]
*  intellectual you're going to have intellectuals and academics leave Israel as well, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6421.2s)]
*  especially with like the academic boycotts that take place to like you're you're basically [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6426.16s)]
*  shutting off your next generation by behaving in this like incredibly violent way. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6431.36s)]
*  You're going to have brain drain. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6436.92s)]
*  I mean, just yesterday it was reported that there's a professor of computer science have [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6438.4s)]
*  been Garian who posted under like the pseudonym John Brown on Twitter. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6444.0s)]
*  I've seen I've seen his content. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6447.76s)]
*  It's probably you've probably looked at bits of his at some point or another. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6448.96s)]
*  Yeah, but he like was suspended from his job and he was like this. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6451.24s)]
*  He was not publicly known that he was tied to this account. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6456.4s)]
*  And it was because he said that Israeli soldiers had committed war crimes. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6459.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's a computer science. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6462.64s)]
*  You know, this is like the more the more shit like that happens, the more shit like that [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6464.32s)]
*  happens, the more you hear about like half a million Israelis leaving Israel. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6467.64s)]
*  OK, the more the Israeli economy becomes unsustainable. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6473.16s)]
*  That's why I said that's why I kept repeating over and over again that like this is going [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6478.2s)]
*  to turn into it like Israel eventually if if they follow this trajectory is going to [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6485.36s)]
*  turn into a nation filled to the brim with just like rabid, uneducated settlers. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6491.72s)]
*  OK, like ultra, ultra fundamentalist, ultra Zionists that simply, you know, are [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6498.76s)]
*  having differences in an opinion, a difference in agreement in the Knesset over like [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6507.96s)]
*  whether women can read or not with with nuclear arms. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6511.88s)]
*  Like it's just that's unsustainable. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6516.0s)]
*  OK, it's it's going to turn into a pure hog state, which it kind of already is turning [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6519.08s)]
*  into a pure hog state to begin with. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6523.88s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's dependent on also like it's, you know, like similar. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6526.76s)]
*  I mean, I would argue like people want to people want like they think everybody wants [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6531.76s)]
*  to be like a U.S. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6537.04s)]
*  vassal, right, because they think that they could get to be like Israel favored military [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6537.72s)]
*  treatment. They could develop like, you know, broad base, you know, like industrialized [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6540.72s)]
*  society with a middle class and all these different things. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6545.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's like it just projects this illusion of stability, all those things taken [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6548.2s)]
*  together over the last few years when like the context in which that state exists [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6553.6s)]
*  is pretty rapidly shifted and like the context in which that leadership operates, like [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6558.68s)]
*  what they believe. I mean, for example, like Kahana, Mayor Kahana, a guy who was [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6563.0s)]
*  illegal to support in Israel 30 years ago because they thought that his his version [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6567.6s)]
*  of extreme Zionism was so dangerous and so self destabilizing. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6573.4400000000005s)]
*  That's now a norm. And even in the diaspora, like, you know, Tablet magazine is running [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6577.240000000001s)]
*  Kahana was right article. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6580.84s)]
*  Yeah, you have like like they what were previously understood as effective boundaries [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6582.36s)]
*  for containing the ideology from like running too far a muck or whatever. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6587.88s)]
*  It's all been removed. And, you know, it's not because like they made a choice and it [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6591.72s)]
*  could have been undone at some point. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6596.12s)]
*  Like this was always how it was bound to go. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6597.32s)]
*  You see, you see liberals, you see liberal Zionists unironically touting the Kahana [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6599.4s)]
*  line, the Kahanas line of never again just means for Jews. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6605.12s)]
*  Like, that's insane. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6609.76s)]
*  That's an insane thing to say. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6612.0s)]
*  Like the notion that like, no, never again wasn't about anybody else. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6613.88s)]
*  It was just about us. Like, what the fuck are you guys talking about? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6617.24s)]
*  It's supposed to be about like Jewish militancy. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6619.12s)]
*  And and, you know, when you see when you see people who are otherwise supposed to be [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6623.44s)]
*  like progressive accounts on Twitter saying stuff like that, that is a that is a [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6627.76s)]
*  turning point, I think, for for, you know, average Israeli society and their and their [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6632.72s)]
*  attitude on these issues. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6637.92s)]
*  What? Why not repurpose the idea of into a reconstruction force these soldiers real [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6640.4s)]
*  life skills? I mean, this is something that I've personally advocated for with the [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6643.6s)]
*  American military as well, but kick out the settles and replace them with displaced [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6646.96s)]
*  Palestinians during the reconstruction process. Why sentence an entire generation of [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6650.4s)]
*  young Jews and Palestinians to end the trauma? I just don't get it. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6652.88s)]
*  Okay. Well, yeah, it's a very pie in the sky. Let's let's stop the let's stop the [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6655.04s)]
*  j**t side first. You know, after October 7, I noticed that they were bringing fake [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6660.4s)]
*  refugees and fake Islam claims here as crime tourism, coined the term crime tourism. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6664.24s)]
*  What are you talking about? Why am I reading this? All right. Edging into Radlib [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6667.36s)]
*  territory. I mean, I think that the American military is a jobs program. And I think that [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6672.5599999999995s)]
*  it would be nice if the American military's output wasn't, you know, the, the complete [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6678.719999999999s)]
*  wholesale murder of Brown children overseas, but instead was to like build bridges and [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6682.639999999999s)]
*  s**t. That would be cool. But, you know, it's not going to happen in America and it's [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6686.4s)]
*  certainly not going to happen in Israel right now. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6691.92s)]
*  Well, and also like in Israel's case, like they're struggling with the fact that like [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6695.12s)]
*  the more that they invest in their military, like that's also like one of the things killing [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6699.76s)]
*  the country and that like is producing like this sort of like what's becoming like a [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6703.36s)]
*  if however long they go with this will become a feature of it that like the heightened [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6707.5199999999995s)]
*  draw on reserves. That is a cost on it is borne by the rest of the country. And like [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6710.72s)]
*  even if they're not about to like fall into immediate financial calamity, right? Like [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6715.92s)]
*  it's not a sign that they're able to like allocate investments in society and all that [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6719.76s)]
*  healthy of a way. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6724.08s)]
*  Yeah. And before some, Simone Zimmerman gets here, who is one of the documentary makers of [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6725.52s)]
*  Israelism, which we've watched on this broadcast before, I want to talk a little bit about the [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6732.08s)]
*  American collapse because America and Israel are, you know, one nation under God indivisible. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6736.72s)]
*  If we're being real, it's a favorite client state. And I understand that, but I think that [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6742.320000000001s)]
*  due to the pervasive influence, the outside influence of the Israeli lobby and due to [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6746.88s)]
*  the dedicated brainwashing social conditioning operation that Zionism engages with on a regular [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6757.36s)]
*  basis. I don't think it's necessarily a favorite client, but one that is just directly [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6766.96s)]
*  a part of the United States and so valuable to the United States that like, even when they [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6776.64s)]
*  fuck over the United States, even when they do counter espionage against the CIA, for example, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6781.84s)]
*  it's still considered appropriate because what are you going to do? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6787.4400000000005s)]
*  Because it's that valuable to us. And also there is that level of influence. This is, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6790.400000000001s)]
*  I would say this is like one of the things that people somewhat disagree with me on. This is like [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6796.320000000001s)]
*  a, an attitude of my design is where they're like, they say like, Oh, this is not something [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6803.6s)]
*  that you can describe purely on material grounds. I disagree with them on this issue. I think that [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6809.52s)]
*  it's like, I disagree with them on this issue because I think that yes, the, the influence of [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6814.96s)]
*  the Israel lobby is, is certainly significant. I still think that the initial reasons as to why [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6823.6s)]
*  this allegiance was developed is because of Israel's position as a, Israel's position as a, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6830.88s)]
*  as a unsinkable aircraft carrier in a resource rich region. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6837.4400000000005s)]
*  And also that like, I mean, again, like Israel, it's part of why also it's important not to lose, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6840.88s)]
*  lose sight of the idea of like Israel as a settler colonial project. Like part of the [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6845.76s)]
*  basis for that was that it was meant so that Israelis and the Zionist leaders as they courted [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6850.4800000000005s)]
*  and sought to court Western governments and even collaborated with them on things like, you know, [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6855.68s)]
*  in the Suez crisis with France and the United Kingdom in the mid 1950s and 56. I mean, I think [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6859.92s)]
*  what you can use, you know, what we can sort of suss out from that is that Israel viewed that [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6866.64s)]
*  settler colonial affinity, not just as a like, we're white, you're white, even though we're not [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6872.64s)]
*  really white, but you get the idea. It was also about how they could be instrumentalized as like [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6876.8s)]
*  a fellow white nation in this, like, you know, grand strategic game against again, like Arab [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6882.0s)]
*  States, which were largely at that time, particularly in the nationalist era aligned with [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6888.16s)]
*  the Soviet union. And the, you know, that, that, that can't do, you can't do pan-Arabic nationalism [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6892.24s)]
*  and link up with the Soviets. That's terrifying, you know, but there's also white supremacy. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6897.68s)]
*  There's also an element of white supremacy involved in this. You can't trust the Arabs [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6903.44s)]
*  no matter what. Okay. You can't trust the Arabs no matter what they're Muslim, they're Christian, [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6908.5599999999995s)]
*  doesn't matter. They're still Arab. Okay. Whereas the way that I think a lot of dumb Americans, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6912.8s)]
*  a lot of Western leaders view Israel is like, well, those are our guys, you know, those are [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6920.320000000001s)]
*  our neighbors. And to a certain degree they are, you know what I mean? Like that's a, you, that's [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6926.08s)]
*  the reason why, like a lot of people, I think initially were, were claiming that like, you know, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6933.360000000001s)]
*  Israel is a, is a white nation, a white supremacy nation. And there is aspects of white supremacy [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6939.2s)]
*  in Israel as well with respect to Ashkenazi Jews, for example. But Israel is, is, Israel has a [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6943.44s)]
*  shit ton of Arab Jews as well, you know, even though they're still because, because of the, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6952.48s)]
*  the ethno-religious supremacist nature of Zionism, the Arab Jews have a specific classification. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6960.4s)]
*  They're still Jewish and therefore of a higher class than what they consider to be in Israeli [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6968.16s)]
*  demographics, Arab. Arab implies someone from an Arab nation or someone from even that area, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6973.92s)]
*  even from Palestine, that is either Muslim or Christian. Yeah. You have, you have Jews that [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6982.72s)]
*  come from the entirety of Levant and the Mena region in general that are sub-categorized under [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6988.48s)]
*  the banner of Judaism. Be careful Arabs are also white and Arab supremacy is just as real [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=6996.96s)]
*  and Afro-Arab. This cannot be denied as an Afro-Arab. This cannot be denied. Okay. We're [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7001.36s)]
*  talking about the, some Arabs are white. Some Arabs are not white. It doesn't matter. This is [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7005.12s)]
*  not the point that I'm trying to make here. Lock in. Okay. Also it depends on where you're, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7010.96s)]
*  it depends on which country you're looking at. Yeah. Go tell American that Arabs are white. Okay. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7016.64s)]
*  I think Simone Zimmerman is here. We're going to be talking about the brain rotting operation [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7022.88s)]
*  of Zionism and the pervasive nature of it and how it, it basically breaks the minds of many [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7027.76s)]
*  otherwise progressive Jewish Americans. But yeah, well, let me, let me pull up a chair. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7036.8s)]
*  You got one. Okay. And then I'm going to fix the microphone as well. One second. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7044.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7052.0s)]
*  All right. Here. Let's just fix this. All right. All right. Yeah. One second. I'm going to fix the [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7060.32s)]
*  noise gate and then we're going to be good. Okay. I did it. I did it. I did it. All right. Did you [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7068.64s)]
*  watch either Matthew Hassan versus Joe Walsh clip or the Sam Seder, Benny Johnson clip, both very [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7075.44s)]
*  satisfying. No, I have not. I have not done either of those things, but yeah, we, okay. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7079.28s)]
*  And what else is I'm going to do? What else is I going to talk about here? Oh, we will of course [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7087.04s)]
*  be featuring, we will of course be covering this part of the conversation, which I think is very [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7092.8s)]
*  interesting. Sympathy stores, Israelis regarding the Middle East situation has hit the lowest in [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7097.12s)]
*  25 years of Gallup's annual tracking support for Israel amongst Democrats has tanked drastically. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7101.12s)]
*  59% of Democrats sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis in this conflict. That is a crazy [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7107.6s)]
*  number that has never occurred. That has never ever occurred in the United States of America. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7112.88s)]
*  Okay. That is crazy. I think this is the peak. This is the peak of, of sympathies for the [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7120.160000000001s)]
*  Palestinians. And it's incredible. That's why I always say, no matter what, when I analyze the [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7126.4800000000005s)]
*  situation by looking at what things used to look like in the past, when Israel was being violent, [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7133.28s)]
*  Israel was doing sieges, or was doing the mowing of the lawn operations that it never got to this [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7138.16s)]
*  point. Never, ever, ever. Okay. And also remember, remember all of this, like all of these sympathies, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7145.04s)]
*  all of these sympathies from the public are coming at a point where there is unfettered, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7156.16s)]
*  unrestricted, unlimited propaganda, unlimited. Think about that. That to me is also insane. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7162.32s)]
*  This is unprecedented. And I will not, I'm not, I'm never going to, I'm never going to discount this. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7172.16s)]
*  And it also does give me some semblance of hope. Okay. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7180.16s)]
*  Okay. We won the info wars. No, we haven't, we haven't won shit. Okay. This is entirely [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7185.04s)]
*  in the hands of Israel. The only reason why 59% of Democrats sympathize more with Palestinians [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7193.84s)]
*  than Israelis in this conflict is directly, is directly due to the unrestricted, unlimited [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7197.68s)]
*  violence that Israel has done. So much so that it is virtually impossible to, to deny. It's [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7206.32s)]
*  virtually impossible to justify. That's it. That's it. It's all in the hands of the U S not Israel. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7213.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's because Israel for many, many years, I think has greatly benefited from the cycle of [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7219.44s)]
*  dehumanization of Palestinians and had to continue doing that in an effort to create [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7225.84s)]
*  in an effort to create your discounting the work of Palestinian journals. Don't do this to me right [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7234.48s)]
*  now. Don't do this woke shit. Of course it's entirely in the hands of brave Palestinians [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7239.28s)]
*  across the board who have filmed their own genocide. Okay. Virtually every single day. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7244.4s)]
*  Don't fucking do this radlib shit. Okay. That much is obvious. I'm talking about [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7250.32s)]
*  Israel's cruelty on top of everything else. God damn it isn't as quiet anymore. And those liberals [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7255.44s)]
*  are doing their survival tactics now. Hence the remorse. Yeah. How did Americans feel about [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7262.4s)]
*  Palestine and Palestinians during nine 11, the Gulf war era? No, people just didn't even know [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7266.08s)]
*  anything. And they only thought about it on tour in the terms of like, Israel's our ally. There are [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7269.6s)]
*  neighbors. It is what it is. You know, they're good guys. They're the good guys. Like people didn't [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7274.0s)]
*  put much thought into it at all. Yes. I know bad empanada made a video criticizing my take saying [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7279.76s)]
*  that I'm a liberal Zionist or something. I don't care guys. Yes, we can have disagreements, even if [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7285.28s)]
*  we almost entirely agree on everything. And every now and then bad empanada freaks out over some [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7293.4400000000005s)]
*  minor shit. Okay. I don't care. This is, I don't know why everyone is like, no, you have to watch [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7300.0s)]
*  this. Especially considering that like, if you're a leftist and you understand the take isn't that [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7305.68s)]
*  fucking big as minor. I know even, even if, even if the disagreements are minor and you consider [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7312.24s)]
*  yourself to be a progressive, you consider yourself to be a leftist. Why the fuck are you [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7319.44s)]
*  trying to make drama between two commentators who are anti Zionist? Like, I just don't get it. I [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7322.96s)]
*  don't care that he did it. Okay. If he wants to use mentioning me or doing a call out post on me [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7328.5599999999995s)]
*  as an opportunity to educate people on his perspective, then that's fine. You know, that's [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7334.799999999999s)]
*  great. More power to them, but I'm not going to sit here and respond to it. And then you're going [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7339.36s)]
*  to clip it out of context and like send it to them and then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It doesn't [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7342.96s)]
*  matter. My thoughts on this are known. Okay. I recognize, I recognize that Zionism is a fascist [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7346.24s)]
*  ideology that revolves around Jewish ethnic religious supremacy. I recognize that Israel is [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7355.679999999999s)]
*  a rabid settler colonial enterprise that has always maintained an apartheid that started off with a [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7362.0s)]
*  ethnic cleansing operation that was planned by early Zionist militias. These are historically [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7370.16s)]

*  all of that, my goal is to pull people from them. And if, and if that is my goal, then I will always, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7404.96s)]
*  I will never discount people that are, that I have disagreements with that might even be engaging in [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7413.12s)]

*  because I get how social conditioning works. Okay. I understand how social conditioning works. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7425.4400000000005s)]
*  I understand how that can change people's minds. Okay. At the end of the day, we are, [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7431.84s)]
*  what is on with the fuck saying, dude, firstly, Turks, same with support white supremacy for [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7438.4800000000005s)]
*  like support pan-Asianism version so well, anti-Israeli Arabs, no problem. Same with differently. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7442.16s)]
*  Bro, no, you need to learn how to write. Okay. Give, I'm giving you an hour, go back to the [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7446.24s)]

*  that every person, every person plays a role in this. Okay. And as long as, as long as someone is [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7464.96s)]
*  anti-occupation, as long as someone demonstrates empathy for the plate of the Palestinians and, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7471.68s)]
*  and they play a role in this, even if I have disagreements with them, even if I feel like [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7478.16s)]
*  they're doing white saviorism or whatever, okay. It still doesn't matter because it moves the [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7482.8s)]
*  needle in the appropriate direction. These things take time. It doesn't happen overnight. Okay. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7487.92s)]
*  The notion that everyone is magically going to rewrite decades of fucking brainwashing, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7494.88s)]
*  decades of brainwashing overnight because of the historic atrocities that there that are unfolding [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7503.2s)]
*  when they are literally trained to believing that these are not real human beings and, and [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7510.08s)]
*  parasitic forces that must be purged. Like I recognize that it takes a long ass time, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7518.24s)]
*  but they play a very, they play a very important role. People in Israel play an important role. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7524.88s)]
*  Even the hostage families who literally want the entirety of Gaza to be wiped out in the [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7532.32s)]
*  period of time when they are demonstrating against the Israeli government, that is creating [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7538.96s)]
*  political pressure for the Israeli government. Do I agree with their opinions? Fuck no. Okay. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7545.6s)]
*  So many of the, the, the hostage family protesters, unironically were like, we want to [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7552.320000000001s)]
*  pummel Gaza too dog. Just get our family members out first. That creates, that creates a point of [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7557.52s)]
*  pressure internally in Israel, even if they don't listen to it. Okay. The Rhodesian voices play an [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7564.56s)]
*  important role. I mean, South African apartheid is a great example of this because yes, economic [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7570.4s)]
*  pressure and boycotts are important because it causes the population to forcibly reckon [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7577.28s)]
*  with the realities and the damages incurred by conducting a fucking genocide by maintaining [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7586.08s)]
*  an apartheid. That's how it works. So yes, that is how this works. You know, I'm not, I'm not a, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7592.4s)]
*  a, I'm not in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. So I see no reason to LARP as such, but from my position, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7599.92s)]
*  I will understandably contextualize how violent or militant movements begin, why they exist, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7609.52s)]
*  how their methods have evolved over time. That is my job. Okay. And for that crime, people call me [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7619.2s)]
*  a terrorist supporter all the time or a terrorist or an anti-Semite all the time. Okay. To a, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7626.24s)]

*  against me. They demand that I get deplatformed. That's it. The Black Panther movement and Malcolm [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7639.76s)]
*  X played an incredibly important role in the civil rights struggle, but so did Martin Luther King. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7645.84s)]
*  Despite both of these leaders and despite both of these movements being deeply unpopular at the [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7652.56s)]
*  time by broader society. Okay. It's very important to understand that the struggle is always going [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7662.320000000001s)]
*  to be multifaceted and I'll take pressure from every aspect that I can get. And before people say, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7671.52s)]
*  you're claiming that you're MLK. No, I'm not saying that I'm just explaining to you how [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7677.759999999999s)]
*  social struggle, social struggle and social progress has taken place in this country. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7685.12s)]
*  I don't disagree with you at all, but I believe that you can also push the needle towards always [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7691.839999999999s)]
*  bringing up what is also part of the Israeli provisions and Jewish exceptions. And when you [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7694.719999999999s)]
*  can already do that, shut the up. I already do that. I do that all the time. Anyone who says [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7697.5199999999995s)]
*  that I don't do that is a fucking delusional. Okay. Shut up. You're now, you're now demanding [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7703.12s)]
*  that I do something that I do all the time. Now you're now you're getting clipped into me [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7709.84s)]
*  in the more woke, more radical direction, I guess. Anyway, are you guys coming? Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7714.0s)]
*  ready. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBJiB-0D2hs&t=7721.44s)]
