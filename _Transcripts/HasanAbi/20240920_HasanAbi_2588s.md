# Hosts Baffled By Boring Oprah Event With VP Harris | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4)
*  Kamala Harris having a very normal and very correct position, which is that you have to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=0.0s)]
*  maintain if you are owner, you have to make sure that it's safe. Like, how is this a negative dude? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=7.12s)]
*  It's like literally it is the same principle behind saying Kamala Harris wants to give you [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  health care. Like how is that a bad thing, bro? Or even their their Senate races and their races [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=18.72s)]
*  in their districts and that race for the white house and overnight, vice president Harris, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=29.84s)]
*  it's pretty normal for the Senate race to divest about five points from the top of the ticket [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=34.88s)]
*  until October. When they closed the gap, both sides tended to go to the middle. That being said, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=37.92s)]
*  this North Carolina situation is very unique and might cause up slash down ballot issues. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=42.4s)]
*  If North Carolina, in North Carolina, if Republicans stay home. Yeah. So I, but like I said, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=46.72s)]
*  the governor race is almost always removed from like other ballot considerations. That's why you [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  have, like I said, even on the same ballot where there's like a presidential race happening, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=61.36s)]
*  you might have a governor that is objectively popular in a red state that happens to be blue, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=66.24s)]
*  for example. All right. With Oprah fielding questions from voters while former president [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=70.88s)]
*  Trump spoke at an anti-Semitism event in Washington, D.C. Chief White House correspondent [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=76.88s)]
*  Mary Bruce is in Detroit for us with the latest. Good morning, Mary. Hey Michael, good morning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=81.76s)]
*  Well, this event here overnight in Michigan was signature Oprah Winfrey from the celebrity [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  appearances to the deeply personal and emotional stories of voters, Harris and Oprah. While aware [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=89.76s)]
*  this race is extremely close and trying to reach out. I hated this event. Oh my God. It was so [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=95.04s)]
*  ass. This is what I was watching when I had to like rage quit basically, even though I had to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=100.4s)]
*  like end the broadcast at that point. It was, it was so 2016 Hillary Clinton. I'm with her style. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  It lasered my brain. It zapped me. And yet a lot of chatters were totally lived up. A lot of chatters [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=111.2s)]
*  were totally lived up. Georgia will take weeks to count. Oh, nice. Those key voters that will make [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=118.56s)]
*  all the difference. You night for America overnight, the queen of talk lending her star power to boost [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=123.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris and get out the vote. Hoping to reach the critical sliver of voters that will [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=129.6s)]
*  determine this race. Please welcome Kamala Harris. God, I hate this shit. In a highly produced virtual [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=134.88s)]
*  rally, Oprah trying to harness enthusiasm for Harris and keep her momentum going, urging Americans [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=141.28s)]
*  to vote their values. Let me tell you, it is about character and it's about decency and respect and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  all the things that we were raised to believe about what it means to be an American citizen [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  and pursue the American dream. Harris doing something she rarely does, fielding questions [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=158.64s)]
*  directly from voters about the issues top of mind for them from immigration to the cost of living, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=163.68s)]
*  to reproductive rights. The former president chose three members of the United States Supreme Court [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=169.36s)]
*  with the intention that they would overdo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=175.28s)]
*  intended. Speaking out for the first time, the family of Amber Thurman, the 28 year old mother, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=180.32s)]
*  who was reportedly the first publicly known woman to lose her life as a result of Georgia's abortion [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=186.08s)]
*  ban. You're looking at a mother that is broken, the worst pain ever that a mother, that a parent [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=192.16s)]
*  could ever feel. According to ProPublica, after a medical abortion, Amber suffered from a grave [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=202.0s)]
*  infection, but doctors waited 20 hours to operate. By then it was too late. I'm just so sorry. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=208.0s)]
*  The word over and over again in her mind is preventable. Yeah. So is she on dad's door [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  before you actually decide to give her help? That's the gun. Is that what we're saying? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=222.48s)]
*  And on the issue of gun violence, Oprah noting Harris herself is a gun owner. I'm a gun owner, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=227.6s)]
*  Tim, I do not know that. If somebody breaks into my house, they're getting shot. Yes, yes, I hear that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=232.64s)]
*  Probably should not have said that, but my staff will deal with that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=240.16s)]
*  Like that was an insane thing to say, bro. I'd be murky. They showed up on my doorstep is a wild [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  thing to say when you're talking about gun control. Like I don't necessarily hate it all that much, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=248.88s)]
*  but like, I don't know how Democrats will view that. I guess they won't hate it because it's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  Kamala saying it and they like anything that she says. She's like, if somebody's breaking in, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=258.88s)]
*  I'm strapped. Like I will blast them. Did we cover this actually coup type groups working to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=263.28s)]
*  intentionally block votes? Yeah. Network of Georgia election officials strategizing to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=268.8s)]
*  undermine the 2024 result emails, real Georgia election integrity coalition, a group of us, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  a group of officials in election denies coordinating in the swing state. Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=277.36s)]
*  Why would they stop bro? They're going to always do this. First of all, remember I say the same. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=281.36s)]
*  Yeah, I know, but I'm not running for president and I'm not trying to captivate the broader [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  marketplace of voters. Okay. And I'm not saying that in the midst of like, you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=291.6s)]
*  gun control conversation immediately after like a school shooting victim talked. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=298.88s)]
*  I think people probably like it though. It is very objectively American. So that's one thing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=305.44s)]
*  What was I going to say? Wait, hold on. I'm trying to figure out what to do. Coordination wise. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=312.96s)]
*  You got to set up [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  back in Washington, former president Donald Trump joining one of his top donors, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  Miriam Adelson at an event aimed at fighting anti-Semitism. If we don't win this election, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=327.2s)]
*  Israel, in my opinion, within a period of two to three years will cease to exist. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=333.84s)]
*  It's going to be wiped out. The former president has said Harris quote doesn't like Jewish people [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  and repeatedly attacked Jews who support Democrats and Harris. Any Jewish person that votes for [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  her, especially now her or the Democrat party should have their head examined. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=350.88s)]
*  Harris's husband, second gentleman, Doug Emhoff himself Jewish responding in an interview with [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=357.76s)]
*  our Michael Strahan. He said this quote, she doesn't like Jewish people and you were like, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=363.28s)]
*  man, Jewish American. So what was your reaction when you heard that in real time? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=369.6s)]
*  So it's typical Donald Trump gaslighting. He is somebody who has had dinner with known anti-Semites. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=375.6s)]
*  He is somebody who during, after the horrific events of Charlottesville where people were [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=383.6s)]
*  actually marching with Tiki torches saying, Jews shall not replace us. And he said there were fine [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=388.72s)]
*  people on both sides of that. Tell him Doug says a guy who has had a record of saying incredibly [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=394.24s)]
*  vile anti-Semitic things. So for him to say that, I just almost laugh at how the chutzpah, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=402.0s)]
*  as we would say, and it's gaslighting. I just, I can't, I'm sorry, dude. Doug is so lame. Like, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=411.76s)]
*  he's so goddamn lame, dude. It is crazy. I mean, he's cooking Trump here and he's saying the right [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=419.28s)]
*  things. But even when he's saying the right things, I'm like, God damn, what a goof this guy is. He is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=425.44s)]
*  such a goddamn cornball goober. Okay. He's just Doug, even his name Doug. Sorry. Harris now heads [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=430.48s)]
*  to Georgia today for a big abortion speech in Atlanta. She'll again be highlighting Amber's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=440.16s)]
*  story and the very real consequences of what she calls Trump's abortion bans. She then finishes [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=444.32s)]
*  the day in battleground, Wisconsin. Trump is off the trail today, but back out in North Carolina [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=449.04s)]
*  tomorrow. Michael. All right, Mary, thank you so much. So last night we heard all about this town [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=453.44s)]
*  hall that Oprah was going to have. She wanted to bring out Kamala Harris and she wanted to introduce [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=459.04s)]
*  her to a town hall and take some questions from the people. I had this little bet with Bill Hemmer, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  who joined me on radio and Bill says she grew up a journalist before she was a talk show host. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=469.04s)]
*  She's going to ask real questions. Bill, you owe me money because there were no real questions. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=473.92s)]
*  There were just saves. She was a lifeguard. She could have been on Baywatch. She could have been [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=479.6s)]
*  on Baywatch saving people from one person from a political death because she kept trying to get [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=484.08s)]
*  her to answer a question. But she also opened it by setting the tone by saying this, by going out [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=490.32s)]
*  of her way, saying something changed with you. The minute Joe Biden stepped out, what was it? Well, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=495.84s)]
*  I'm just the veil dropped. Yeah, the veil dropped. Really? I haven't seen the veil drop. And she said, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=500.56s)]
*  suddenly she felt a certain responsibility. And that's the kind of the way it went. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, Oprah Winfrey is perhaps one of the preeminent talk show hosts of American television [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=511.68s)]
*  history. And so, you know, keep in mind she has been an independent politically. The only time [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=519.2s)]
*  she really got behind any candidate was in 2007 with Barack Obama. No one thinks he's independent. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=525.92s)]
*  She really pushed him at that point. And she stayed to the side. We never really see, we never saw her [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=530.8s)]
*  at a convention endorse anybody until this summer when she put everything she's got behind [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=536.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris. Yeah, I don't know how you host a town hall type format for two hours after you [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=542.72s)]
*  essentially gave a political endorsement of a candidate. Well, we know whose side she's on. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=547.84s)]
*  On the stage. She used to work, represent that working class woman appealing to the issues that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=552.72s)]
*  mattered to them. So she had an opportunity, a question was asked to press her on this question [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=558.96s)]
*  right here. Watch. We really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=564.56s)]
*  Yeah, I got a Hassan Abed delivering the food up to my room. Definitely at the hotel. He got so excited [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=570.64s)]
*  and he was like, thank you, Hassan. One hundred OP. Are you stocked up on zines? Hell yeah, baby. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=578.0s)]
*  What are you crazy? There's nothing funnier than talking about doing a town hall. Well, Oprah, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=582.56s)]
*  when Donald Trump does town halls with like Sarah fuckabee Sanders and like Sean Hannity, and I [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=586.8s)]
*  guess they're just jealous that, you know, they got pulled like that. First of all, thank you both [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=591.6s)]
*  for being here. And yours is a story I hear around the country as I travel. And in terms of both [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=596.72s)]
*  rightly having the right to have aspirations and dreams and ambitions for your family and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=605.76s)]
*  working hard and finding that the American dream is for this generation and so many recently [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=615.44s)]
*  far more elusive than it's been. Oh, God. We need to deal with that. And there are a number of ways. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=623.28s)]
*  One is bringing down the cost of everyday necessities, including groceries. So that's [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=629.04s)]
*  why I'm taking on, for example, price gouging, which is when, you know, most companies and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=634.08s)]
*  corporations are good, but for those bad ones, they take advantage of people, especially during [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=640.64s)]
*  a pandemic or extreme weather, and they end up jacking up prices. You know what I realize? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=645.28s)]
*  The truth doesn't matter because the truth is inflation is high. That's why prices are up [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=650.8s)]
*  under Barack, I mean, under Barack, under Biden and under Kamala Harris's presidency. And interest [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=656.88s)]
*  rates are high. They did go down, you know, 50 basis points, but not as low as they were under [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=664.56s)]
*  Donald Trump when they were 2.44 percent. People can't have the American dream like they used to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=669.68s)]
*  under President Trump. But if they they hate Donald Trump so much that they put on these shows, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=675.3599999999999s)]
*  they bring in all these celebrities, which I don't think helps. I think actually it hurts. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=681.3599999999999s)]
*  Julia Roberts, she zoomed in, Bryan Cranston, Chris Rock, Meryl Streep and others as well. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=685.76s)]
*  And those are the coastal elites. Those are the celebrities that no one can relate to. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=693.28s)]
*  Oprah's a billionaire. You know, people in that audience behind her are struggling because of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=697.12s)]
*  these high prices. It's all smoke and mirrors, though. This is all propaganda to make you think [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=701.92s)]
*  that Kamala Harris is going to be a great candidate. Meanwhile, if you look at her voting record, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=706.48s)]
*  she is so progressive. She wants to take money from hardworking Americans so that everyone's [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=710.32s)]
*  equal. Everyone makes the same amount of money. But look at her response, though. I mean, every [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=715.6s)]
*  time she speaks, I leave dizzy. She just speaks. I mean, like it's one thing I cannot say. Make [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=720.72s)]
*  your point and get out of it. Just one to move. And she just does that. I don't think progressive [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=729.2s)]
*  has the same level of stink that they think it has. I'm serious. I don't think Americans like [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=736.24s)]
*  view the term progressive as a bad thing, nor do they think like Kamala Harris is going to give you [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=741.6s)]
*  all healthcare as a necessarily bad thing. A much better substitute in terms of like market [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=747.2s)]
*  reception would be radical left or even liberal, radical liberal, too liberal. That was dumb of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=753.0400000000001s)]
*  them to just let us know point a point B, this one going to make your life better and move on. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=759.2s)]
*  Speaker 3rd-Gilbert-Klatschke Keep in mind, she has the job already. If she knew how to bring prices [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=766.08s)]
*  down, she would have done it. I'm pretty sure number two is the price gouging. She's shown no [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=769.2800000000001s)]
*  proof of any price gouging. And she took at least a minute and a half to get to price gouging. I [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=773.36s)]
*  understand. Acknowledge the question and answer the question. But you're acknowledging the question. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=779.2s)]
*  Good. Everybody, this is something that you need to understand. This right there. This right here [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=783.44s)]
*  is a perfect demonstration of Republicans showing their hand because they're locked into [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=788.48s)]
*  the automatic posture of defending corporations. When Democrats do something that is anti-capitalist [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=795.36s)]
*  inherently, or even remotely threatens the bottom line of corporations, no matter which one it is, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=800.96s)]
*  Republicans have to instinctively defend it. Okay. And that is precisely what's happening here. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=808.0s)]
*  Tackling grocery corporations doing price gouging, whether you agree with the policy or not, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=813.2800000000001s)]
*  is objectively popular. It polls at 83%. 83%. So now when you say you are going to tackle price [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  gouging, you are getting Republican mouthpieces to personally defend the interests of mega [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=829.44s)]
*  corporations that you have already identified as villains in your mind. This is why I always say [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=835.5200000000001s)]
*  you have to, this is why I always say you have to defend these positions, man. You have to give [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=843.12s)]
*  Republicans something to fight against. That's it. I have no answer to the question. That was it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=848.48s)]
*  She's oh, it was so tedious to watch. And then you think when the celebrities came on, they would [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=854.0s)]
*  say something, I know it's crazy, they would say something of substance. Oh, they says I feel joy, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=858.72s)]
*  I feel happy now. You know what that is more of a hit on? Joe Biden. I'm so glad Joe Biden is not [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=864.32s)]
*  going to be president. And Chris Rock said, I want to be able to take my little girls to the White [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=870.4s)]
*  House to a black president. And I'm like, well, you're a celebrity, you have that opportunity to [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=873.0400000000001s)]
*  go to the White House and take your little girls. Yeah, meanwhile, the other black kids are struggling, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=877.6800000000001s)]
*  can't read and write in many of our communities, have to deal with the legals that's taking over [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=881.6s)]
*  the communities, the rec centers and all that. So all these people have the luxury to have joy [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=885.52s)]
*  because the economy is not impacting them on the same level. Well, the whole idea behind this is [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=890.16s)]
*  because Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are only going to do the one debate. She's not really going [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=896.3199999999999s)]
*  to do any interviews, you know, with real news people. Wait, what? Then make Trump do another [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=901.84s)]
*  debate. Brian, you made the point with Bill Hemmer. She used to be a reporter. She was a reporter [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=906.56s)]
*  in Baltimore. But she was there as an activist to try to prop her up. Because what the campaign [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=911.52s)]
*  is trying to do is they're trying to get the people who are persuadable right now, according [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=918.8s)]
*  to the new Fox News poll, the people who support Trump and Kamala Harris, only 1% of them are [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=922.56s)]
*  movable. But there are there's a tiny little sliver in the middle that are undecided. And that's why [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=928.64s)]
*  they're trying to do this. It's unconventional, because this was all streaming. So it's they're [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=934.72s)]
*  obviously going after kids who watch everything on the phone. The New York Times just dropped a [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=940.08s)]
*  story that says and this goes to the point about how important your phone is. And the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=945.2s)]
*  Yeah, kids love Oprah Winfrey and $50,000 in in tax cuts for startup businesses. Kids, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=950.24s)]
*  famously high propensity voters. Let's say when he says kids, he's talking about 18 plus, but even [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=958.32s)]
*  beyond that, not only are people under the age of 35, low propensity voters for a multitude of [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=964.88s)]
*  different reasons. They also quite literally do not give a single shred of about Oprah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=970.48s)]
*  The online stuff, the week of the debate, the Kamala Harris campaign outspent Trump 20 to one, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=975.92s)]
*  buying ads on Facebook and Instagram. The whole idea was to say essentially, we've got a lot of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=984.24s)]
*  money, and we're going to try to get the message out. She's this and so they're presenting a certain [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=990.32s)]
*  image. And there's a lot of feelings, but not a lot of facts. So she also talked about something [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=995.6s)]
*  else. Yeah, she talked about the we know she hasn't she said that when she was asked about the mandatory [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1002.08s)]
*  buyback thing at the debate, you want to buy back everyone's you're going to make everyone turn over [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1007.5200000000001s)]
*  their their and she said no, no, no, Tim has her vice president and I have a so we learned more [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1012.32s)]
*  about that and what she plans to do with her if someone breaks in her house. I hate that they're [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1019.36s)]
*  like, you can be an owner and still push for a man like push for a buyback dude. It doesn't have [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1023.76s)]
*  to be mandatory. Listen, I'm an owner Tim. I didn't know that. And somebody breaks in my house. Yes, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1029.2s)]
*  yes, I hear that. I hear that probably should not have said that, but my staff will deal with that [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1036.24s)]
*  later. They deal with everything. They always clean up the mess. This whole campaign has been [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1041.68s)]
*  run by staff, but even over who's being genuine, genuine. She goes, I did not know that no one [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1046.8s)]
*  knows that you've been district attorney. You've been attorney general and you've been sent. There [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1053.52s)]
*  has been no ads ever cut of common common here saying that she has talked in the past about [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1057.36s)]
*  and talked about the need to keep it in. I don't understand. Does it break your mind? Well, one, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1065.04s)]
*  she's such a goddamn cop, but even her answer is so cop adjacent where she's like, if someone [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1071.04s)]
*  brings in my house, I'm blasting. Right? Like that was a genuine moment. I think it'll probably [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1076.16s)]
*  play well for a broader audience of America, broader audience of Americans, because like [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1081.1200000000001s)]
*  Americans are all John Rambo in the way that they see themselves. But like these guys are so [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1086.8000000000002s)]
*  brainbroken where they're like, Oh wow. Like she never announced that she had like, what do you [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1092.4s)]
*  mean, dude? She's not at a traffic stop. She doesn't have to tell the cops. She has a, okay. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1097.52s)]
*  I mean, she is a cop, but beyond that, like it's such a perfect demonstration that like ownership [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1102.08s)]
*  for them is not like a thing that happens, a thing that exists. Like it has to be performative. It [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1108.08s)]
*  has to be the most important aspect of your personality. But well, she's never mentioned [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1116.08s)]
*  that she has a before it's like, so what do you have to always mention it? It's not the top of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1119.76s)]
*  the hour ad break, or I have to tell you ahead of time that the top of the hour comes with a three [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1125.04s)]
*  minute ad break. You know, very stupid. Anyway, here's a three minute break. Now it's just very [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1129.76s)]
*  revealing how they view. And by the way, those guys, none of those guys are probably owners [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1135.92s)]
*  anyway, because they're all libtards living in New York. Most Fox news commentators are literally [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1139.76s)]
*  libtards living in New York. So they probably don't have it anyway. And don't even like that's [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1146.24s)]
*  the other thing that you have to remember to them is just purely an aesthetic that like the dumb hogs [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1150.24s)]
*  love. So that's why they're like, Oh, don't get it. She never talked about it before. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1156.08s)]
*  This place let's listen to the DA Kamala Harris, talk about what happens, what police should be [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1158.96s)]
*  doing for donors. Watch. We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1166.88s)]
*  community. And just because you legally possess in the sanctity of your block. Wow. I can't believe [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1172.8s)]
*  it. This one P video in 2007, has Kamala Harris saying the correct things about ownership. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1179.6s)]
*  Home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1186.8s)]
*  responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affair. Okay, so that was the house is [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1191.28s)]
*  barging in. And this is now so last night, she talked about how she and the vice presidential [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  candidate, Tim Walz both have interesting tidbit. Apparently, Tim Walz is doing debate prep. And do [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1201.68s)]
*  you know who is preparing dog? I don't know if like we are so brain broken as a nation. I think [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1208.64s)]
*  we probably are, but what they did there was to showcase Kamala Harris having a very normal and [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1214.4s)]
*  very correct position, which is that you have to maintain. If you are owner, you have to make sure [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1222.64s)]
*  that it's safe. Like how was this a negative dude? It's like literally it is the same principle behind [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1229.0400000000002s)]
*  saying Kamala Harris wants to give you healthcare. Like how was that a bad thing, bro? That's not a [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1236.32s)]
*  bad thing. It's like saying Kamala Harris wants to destroy Israel. No plain Buddha, Buddha judge, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1241.12s)]
*  exactly. And who did Buddha judge work up before worked with Kamala Harris when it was time to [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1247.6s)]
*  debate Mike Pence. I think her flip flops just show she knows she has to be more of a moderate. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1253.84s)]
*  She has to paint herself more as a moderate. We know she's not, we know she's progressive. Bernie [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1259.12s)]
*  Sanders says she's progressive. She's just being pragmatic so that she can win this election. She [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1262.88s)]
*  is not a moderate. Look at her voting record. I think now she's saying tax on no tax on tips [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1267.2800000000002s)]
*  because she stole that from Donald Trump. She knows that that was a winning message, especially [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1272.4s)]
*  for Nevada and people that work in the industry, food industry and beverage industry. Then she also [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1276.0800000000002s)]
*  said mandatory buyback on your, then she flip flopped on that to sound more like president Trump. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1281.0400000000002s)]
*  You can keep your in fact I have a and then she said no fracking. Now she's saying I need to [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1285.68s)]
*  explain something to you. These people, much like the Democratic Party, legitimately believe [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1290.56s)]
*  that being moderate, being perceived as moderate is a good thing. Okay. That it's like an automatic [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1296.32s)]
*  lock for victory. That's why they're saying Kamala Harris is not a moderate. She's a radical [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1301.76s)]
*  progressive. Now the problem here is they do actually believe that like they believe that, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1305.84s)]
*  but it's false. And the example I will show you is currently the most popular person on this campaign. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1309.9199999999998s)]
*  His name is Tim waltz. Remember early on when they revealed that Tim waltz was going to be the VP [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1318.0s)]
*  pick and Trump and all the Republicans on Fox news celebrated, they were like, Oh, what a stupid [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1323.28s)]
*  person. I can't believe she didn't go with Josh Shapiro. What an idiot. And I told you back then [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1329.28s)]
*  part of that is just cope. And the other part is because they truly are believers. Everyone is a [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1334.2399999999998s)]
*  goddamn liberal in the United States of America at the end of the day. Okay. I'm not saying what [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1338.9599999999998s)]
*  she's presenting herself as chatter. Don't misunderstand me. I'm saying that presenting [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1344.16s)]
*  yourself as a progressive isn't a bad thing. Just stick to the issues. And that's it. Stick to the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1348.3200000000002s)]
*  issues and have Republicans defend the inverse of said issues and have them explain why, you know, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1353.76s)]
*  giving people healthcare, giving children healthcare or, or, or paying for their meals is a, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1362.72s)]
*  radical position in this country. That's it. That's all you need to do, baby. Explain to them [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1370.0s)]
*  on the policy front that Republicans nefariously try to make it seem as though progressive policy [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1375.68s)]
*  positions are just bad without ever being called out for it. Tim waltz is the most progressive person. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1382.0800000000002s)]
*  It obviously showed, um, it, or sorry, Tim was the most progressive person and, and the Republican [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1388.0s)]
*  party celebrating the Tim waltz pig is like a massive L for Kamala Harris. In my opinion, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1395.28s)]
*  showed once again, that they do honestly believe that like running on a progressive message is bad, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1402.48s)]
*  but they are out of touch and they are wrong. It is not bad. Problem is liberals also believe it. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1408.8799999999999s)]
*  That's the issue. And you frack sounding like Donald Trump. And then here she's saying, if [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1414.0s)]
*  you break in my house, I'll shoot you like a lot of Americans would do, but it's also such a secret [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1419.12s)]
*  service. Okay. All right. They're going to be the people that don't pretend to the American [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1423.84s)]
*  people. You think people at home really think that Kamala Harris is going to be the person [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1428.48s)]
*  wielding the or if someone breaks in, hopefully they do a better job than they've been doing with [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1432.3999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump though. And they stopped the person for even going to the perimeter. Right. So I just [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1436.48s)]
*  don't believe her. Right. I like to know that how long she's trained with it because you've got to [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1441.76s)]
*  learn to train with it. You can't just have it. I thought the responsible thing to do a couple of [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1445.6s)]
*  things. Well, there's a story in political today that says that she does not talk about [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1449.52s)]
*  manufacturing in those blue States in Michigan and Ohio and in Pennsylvania. And that could be [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1453.92s)]
*  a huge detriment. The other problem she's having is, you know, those uncommitted that showed up [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1458.6399999999999s)]
*  not to vote for Joe Biden, to vote uncommitted. They have not committed to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1463.2s)]
*  They said they have not gotten the answers that they want. And that could affect in area in [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1468.96s)]
*  Michigan, in Arizona, in North Carolina and Wisconsin. Now you have no uncommitted line. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1473.52s)]
*  You could just leave it blank, but there is an uncommitted line in Nevada. So if you know, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1479.2s)]
*  if you're going to say, if you're angry about the Israeli Gaza situation and are not happy with her [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1484.88s)]
*  agreeing to an embargo, you are staying with uncommitted. That is a huge boon for president [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1490.88s)]
*  Trump. Well, actually uncommitted national said we still oppose Donald Trump and we don't encourage [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1496.32s)]
*  anybody to vote third party. So it sounds like they're just saying, don't vote. So it'll be [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1502.24s)]
*  interesting to see what happens. There's an option to vote uncommitted. They're being urged to vote [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1507.84s)]
*  uncommitted at this time. Our movement cannot. And I hate, I hate these guys. Did he also say angry [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1511.4399999999998s)]
*  about the embargo? Like, does he just think that that's what liberals are mad about? Like as in [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1519.36s)]
*  like, they want no embargo. That's how little they've thought about this. They just don't give up. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1525.28s)]
*  They're like, yeah, yeah. Don't vote for Kamala Harris Gaza. Right? All you silly ass libtards. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1530.32s)]
*  All you give it about is like exploded children, exploded Brown children who deserve it. Like, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1534.96s)]
*  yeah, don't vote. Don't vote for Kamala Harris. Of course, vice president Harris. That's, that's [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1540.48s)]
*  huge. And I think too, they, a lot of people are going to say, we should not give them the answers, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1545.92s)]
*  but I tell you what, you're going to hate Trump's answer because he was yesterday speaking to a [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1549.76s)]
*  Jewish American group and he was letting everybody know I've been the best friend to Israel. I don't [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1554.8s)]
*  even think Trump's critics would say that I have. And I can't believe that if you're an American [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1559.44s)]
*  and you have Jewish faith that you would not vote for me. He says right now he's only got 40% of the [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1564.88s)]
*  Jewish vote because how could I not have a hundred? I'm Steve Deucy. I'm Brian Lee. And I'm Ainsley [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  Earhart. And click here. I mean, I don't know. That's a good, that's a good question. Hi. Perhaps [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1574.4s)]
*  it's one that warrants a further examination. It warrants an interrogation. You know, great question. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1580.4s)]
*  Why is it that 100% of Jews are not in support of Donald Trump? Maybe, just maybe the universal [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1587.5200000000002s)]
*  cynical application that marries the concepts of Judaism and Zionism is just built around a falsehood. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1596.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't know. I'm no big city lawyer chat, but it kind of feels like at least all the data that I've [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1604.5600000000002s)]
*  seen, it doesn't seem to be the most significant thing, the most consequential thing for American [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1610.72s)]
*  Jews. Why the would they care about Israel that much? You literally are a big city lawyer. I am [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1616.24s)]
*  not a big city lawyer. How dare you? Kamala Harris. And this is the Wired Autocomplete interview. What [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1621.36s)]
*  do you want me to do with each one? It's not going to be in the camera shot? Because I don't believe [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1628.72s)]
*  in littering. Okay. How to pronounce Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. My baby nieces, you can go on [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1634.64s)]
*  YouTube and they did a really great tutorial on how to pronounce my name. So look it up. What did [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris's mother tell her? She told us that we should never let anyone tell us who we are. You [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1651.28s)]
*  tell them who you are. She said to me many times, Kamala, you may be the first to do many things. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1658.8s)]
*  Make sure you're not the last. She made even one vote earning decision after naming Tomas. It's [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1663.52s)]
*  been misfire after misfire ever since. Yes, I agree with you. 100 P it's ass. She has been [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1668.16s)]
*  utter hot ass since the Tim Walz pick. Well, I guess like did the price gouging thing came, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1676.16s)]
*  did the price gouging thing come before or after? That was the only other thing. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1683.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. Just straight. I think I, with the exception of like, I'm going to tackle price gouger. It has [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1687.2s)]
*  just been awful. The debate wasn't all hot ass. No, we're talking about like earning votes beyond [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1693.28s)]
*  the aesthetics chatter beyond the aesthetics. If you are already committed to going out to vote [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1700.96s)]
*  and you care about civility in politics, then yes, she, she did a fantastic job earning your vote by [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  showcasing the fact that she is an adult woman and someone who's a responsible adult. It's [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1716.8s)]
*  especially when matched against Donald Trump. The problem is outside of that, if we're talking [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1723.2s)]
*  about like any kind of real momentum, any kind of real progressive policies that she would be [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1729.3600000000001s)]
*  responsible for, if elected, she'd been hot ass. She keeps saying how she's middle-class and loves [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1737.8400000000001s)]
*  the middle-class and loves small businesses over and over and over and over and over again. It's [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1744.0800000000002s)]
*  like, who is this for dog? Who is this for? So as two years old, my mother told me to look out for [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1750.24s)]
*  my little sister. These are all instructions that she gave me that I have carried throughout my life. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1756.72s)]
*  What does Kamala Harris stand for? I am a daughter of parents who are active in civil rights movement. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1762.48s)]
*  Oh God, here we go. What does she stand for? She's the middle class. She's middle class. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1769.04s)]
*  That's what she stands for. She's middle class. And also, have I told you guys that I'm middle [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1774.48s)]
*  class? I want to mention, I want to mention once again, I'm middle-class and I love small business [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1780.0s)]
*  opportunity, economy, opportunity, economy. Why is that a bad thing? Cause his fake is it's [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1785.36s)]
*  phony dude. Think about Tim Walz. Think about the way Tim Walz communicates his background. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1789.36s)]
*  He was a teacher. He was a veteran. Okay. When you listen to him speak, whether it's because [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1795.2s)]
*  whether what he did as a coach, whether what, whether it's about what he did as a teacher, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1800.64s)]
*  like there is a level of authenticity to it. Okay. Kamala Harris simply just goes, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1804.72s)]
*  I'm middle-class. I'm middle-class. I love small businesses. I love small business. She laughed. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1809.52s)]
*  She laughed when she says she loves small businesses. She did that. I love small [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1814.16s)]
*  businesses. Ain't nobody feels that way. Okay. That's not a real thing, man. I was worried about [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1817.84s)]
*  the genocide, but she says she will give 50 K to small businesses. Yeah. Like I asked you this [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1822.48s)]
*  question when the first plan was unveiled that she was going to do $50,000 in tax cuts for small [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1826.72s)]
*  businesses, startups, startup economy, opportunity economy, yada, yada, yada. It's like classic [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1830.8s)]
*  liberal elite speak, by the way, that is like truly repulsive, utterly repulsive to like the [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1836.8s)]
*  broadest sub-sex of American society. Those that live both in places like New York and California, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1842.3999999999999s)]
*  but certainly outside of places like New York and California where people feel left behind. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1848.1599999999999s)]
*  Okay. They hate that language and I get it. Like I get why they hate that language. That language [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1852.96s)]
*  is repulsive. It sucks. And all I will say is this, Tim walls is locked in to defending Kamala Harris's [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1858.3999999999999s)]
*  positions, no matter how they are, because he's a VP. He's a loyal soldier. So just listen to the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1865.92s)]
*  way he talks about these issues and what he seeks to omit when talking about these issues and what [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1870.72s)]
*  he seeks to focus when talking about even the policies that Kamala Harris is advancing. And [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1877.2s)]
*  you will understand why the way Kamala Harris presents a lot of this stuff is just as okay. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1883.28s)]
*  If you live in one of these flyover States, if you live in the rust belt, if you live in a town [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1890.48s)]
*  that has been like absolutely gutted by capitalism as like the industry has left because they shipped [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1894.56s)]
*  manufacturing jobs, either Mexico with NAFTA, or they ship manufacturing jobs to China and, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1900.1599999999999s)]
*  and left nothing but rubble behind. And you hear someone from California go, I love the [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1907.2s)]
*  opportunity economy. I'm middle-class. I love small businesses. I love my small businesses. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  You're gonna be like, what the are you talking about? Do give me money. Give me fucking money. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1919.28s)]
*  That's why her, her, her statements on price gouging, going after price gougers is the most [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1923.36s)]
*  popular policy position that she has right now. That's her most popular policy position. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1930.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay. In spite of the regular attacks against said policy from Republicans, Republican media [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1937.6799999999998s)]
*  saying it's VUVU Zilla saying it's Venezuela saying it's Kami Harris. It doesn't matter. People are [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1945.1999999999998s)]
*  like, well, I don't give a it's too expensive. Do the same for rent. Okay. Do the same for rent. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1950.88s)]
*  Do the same for rent. Just say it. Yolo. We are going to, we're going to drive rent down. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1957.3600000000001s)]
*  Even if they, even if you don't have a good idea about how you're going to do it, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1963.2s)]
*  you should just say it regardless. Okay. Just say it. It's a real problem that people experience, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1966.0800000000002s)]
*  a real problem that people are, people are living through address that issue. Child tax credit is [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1972.3200000000002s)]
*  good. I'm a small business owner. I couldn't get in the less of a, about the small business [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1980.32s)]
*  tax credit. Nobody cares. No, the child tax credit is good. And it's also objectively very popular. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1982.8799999999999s)]
*  I still hate the delivery mechanism of the child tax credit because obviously it's a tax credit [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1989.4399999999998s)]
*  and it seems like we have nothing. We only have like, what's good. March is here. It seems like [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1994.56s)]
*  we only like Democrats will only solve a problem by like gutting revenue streams and, and trying [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=1998.96s)]
*  to arrive at a backward solution. Like the better alternative is subsidies, but obviously tax cuts. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2008.24s)]
*  We have primed the American population to believing that tax cuts are good and tax hikes are bad, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2013.92s)]
*  which is why no Democrat will ever demonstrate courage and be like, no, we're just going to [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2021.04s)]
*  give you money. You know, I think I got to disagree as a dude that works in a warehouse. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2025.2s)]
*  Most people aren't thinking about this kind of thing. Honestly, God think Trump is better on [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2029.1200000000001s)]
*  the economy off. Nothing other than vibes. No dude. They think Trump is better on the economy [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2031.68s)]
*  because that's like a thing that the Republicans in a, in an, in a media marketplace that is [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2036.48s)]
*  slanted towards hyper capitalism. Of course, the side that is more pro deregulation is always going [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2042.64s)]
*  to come across like they are better for business. Okay. The media will present this false narrative [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2048.64s)]
*  thoroughly. But beyond that, Trump also does regularly say, I'm going to cut prices. He just [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2054.96s)]
*  doesn't tell you how and it's, but he says it. So people hear it just like he also lied routinely [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2061.36s)]
*  in 2016 about how he was going to bring manufacturing jobs back. Okay. That's it. Like [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2068.2400000000002s)]
*  people like to hear that from their politicians. I promise you, if you are hurting, okay, this is [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2073.6000000000004s)]
*  the worst audience to communicate this to, because a lot of you are nerds. Okay. You're the most [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2079.52s)]
*  annoying goddamn nerds on the planet. And therefore you have no capacity to look at a situation and [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2084.88s)]
*  be like, maybe people do believe the politician when the politician says, I'm going to cut your [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2092.2400000000002s)]
*  prices, even if the politician is lying. Okay. That's the problem. A lot of you are goddamn nerds. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2097.92s)]
*  So you go, but Trump is lying. It's like, yeah, I know dumb ass. It doesn't matter. People believe [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2104.56s)]
*  him. If you're looking at an election, that's good marketing. Okay. That's it. Yeah. You don't have [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2109.44s)]
*  to use any of that. I don't know what that is. What do you have to give a vendor pass? Damn bro. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2114.16s)]
*  Flex March is a vendor pass. He's staying in a much nicer hotel. Yeah. He's a little bro-ing me. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2119.6s)]
*  Okay. I'm gonna shit. Hold up. No, no, I'm going with it. Well, you don't like my fit asking me [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2128.7999999999997s)]
*  if I'm changing. What the hell doors open. Oh, I'm not there to sign it. Can you just drop it off? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2134.72s)]
*  I can't sign it. I'm not there right now. Sure. A piker. Thank you. All right. This is ridiculous. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2140.08s)]
*  It's on the bros and fellow Kamala door knockers have found me and keep using me for their talking [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2146.0s)]
*  point. Paychex law. What are you? You are saying the vibes are showing Trump up, but polling has [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2151.12s)]
*  him near one to two lead only down from what it was. No, no, no. Kamala Harris has been able to [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  catch up to Donald Trump on the economy because he just, he doesn't even, he, he focuses entirely [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2160.96s)]
*  too much on immigration right now. His strong suit is the economy and he's completely dropped [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2166.96s)]
*  the ball on it because he literally almost exclusively talks about immigrants. That is [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2172.16s)]
*  the real reason why Trump is actually down on the economy in comparison to where he was on the [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2177.92s)]
*  economy because he just has no interest in talking about anything. He said he had concepts of a plan [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2182.7200000000003s)]
*  that was bad. Okay. But you also have to understand he literally can't shut the up about [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2190.48s)]
*  migrants, bro. He was at the antisemitism conference yesterday and he said, migrants are responsible [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2196.96s)]
*  for the rise in antisemitism. That's when I knew this man has lost his sauce. Okay. I feel like [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2206.56s)]
*  old Trump also despised immigrants, but would never say such an idiotic thing. Okay. Like [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2214.48s)]
*  antisemitism is being caused by the migrants is such a funny thing to say when like the people [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2221.36s)]
*  repeating his anti-migrant sentiment are straight up blood and soil. Jews will not replace us Nazis, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2227.52s)]
*  which he historically sided with and said, we're very fine people. So like that's like that, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2234.88s)]
*  that to me spells that he's just got, he's so one note. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2241.04s)]
*  Ashley took me when I was in a stroller to civil rights marches where they were fighting for [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2243.84s)]
*  freedom, for justice, for equality. I believe for example, right now that one of the biggest things [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2250.96s)]
*  that we must fight for is good on economies. Also effectively a dog was before will deport [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2256.24s)]
*  immigrants who are taking your job. Nah, nah, I don't think, I don't think so. I think some [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2261.36s)]
*  people do believe that, but I think most people, most people now have moved on to like migrants are [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2265.84s)]
*  a problem for national security rather than like migrants are a problem for the economy. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2271.6000000000004s)]
*  I think most Americans, most America, like a lot of the Americans who think migrants are bad for [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2277.76s)]
*  national security, literally higher undocumented migrants. So are we talking about every single [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2282.6400000000003s)]
*  person, every single nose or maybe is like oblivious to this reality, but there is a person out there [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2287.36s)]
*  in one of the businesses that you have hired or in one of the businesses that you encounter, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2294.24s)]
*  whether they be like the HVAC specialist or whether it be, you know, I don't know, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2299.52s)]
*  landscapers or something like that, or the guy that your landlord hires to fix your HVAC. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2304.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like someone that you, someone that you interact with on a daily basis [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  that is a business owner that is right wing absolutely is sitting there and hiring [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2318.0s)]
*  undocumented migrants. Okay. 1000% restaurants that you frequent, the owner might be right wing, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2324.16s)]
*  but they are absolutely hiring undocumented migrants. That's it. Every kitchen in every [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2331.12s)]
*  restaurant. So these guys that yet people that are taking care of the elderly, your grandparents, like [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2337.04s)]
*  they still hate them, but it don't matter. They also kind of recognize that these guys are do, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2343.36s)]
*  Oh, sorry. These guys are just doing jobs that you don't want to do for the price point that [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2348.8s)]
*  you will never take. I was watching and I happen to agree completely with what you just said, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2353.44s)]
*  but the thought that the only thing you have eaten for dinner in the past six years was chicken. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2357.52s)]
*  Did I just watch you eat something else? Yeah. I had a shawarma. I just had a show. Are you [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2361.6000000000004s)]
*  good? I chatter Kelly Osborne take. What do you mean? Kelly Osborne take is just the truth of the [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2366.4s)]
*  matter. Like there is not a single crop that's picked in this country that doesn't touch migrant [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2371.84s)]
*  hands. Okay. They are used and abused. My solution to this problem is not necessarily to keep them [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2376.88s)]
*  undocumented and hyper exploited. It is to document them. I know this isn't what we want to hear here, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2384.96s)]
*  but the older suburb generation, almost everything she's done has slapped. It's all I get child tax [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2391.44s)]
*  credit, lower prices, housing plans, all fired these people up. They love her calm delivery is [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2396.32s)]
*  what they want. Yeah. I don't care, dude. There are a ton of people out there. Okay. Those people [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2400.56s)]
*  already voted for Joe Biden. Joe Biden already defeated Donald Trump. Those people are either [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2405.68s)]
*  going to come out and vote regardless. They always vote. They love voting. Older people [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2411.04s)]
*  in the suburbs love voting and she already has them on the civility front. The problem is [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2414.56s)]
*  those people are already invested. Those people are already going to go out and vote. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2420.16s)]
*  You're talking about people who are going to go out and vote and they're going to vote for [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2423.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris, just like they were going to vote for Joseph Robinette branded. We're not talking [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2426.64s)]
*  about those people. This is what's very frustrating about this story is like, yes, I know upper [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2430.72s)]
*  middle-class suburbians love neoliberal policies. I get that, but there is a massive amount of people [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2435.44s)]
*  that you're just like leaving your casting aside. There's a massive amount of people that you could [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2440.56s)]
*  potentially, if you made a convincing argument, move over to your side as well. I just don't like, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2444.96s)]
*  I don't know. I hate this, like tailoring your policy, hyper specific policy. That's not going [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2450.64s)]
*  to really help a lot of Americans. Exclusively to the whims of like, you know, the upper middle [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2456.16s)]
*  class, suburban white people with a college education. There's a ton of people that don't [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2463.68s)]
*  have that college education that are just like looking for something different. One of the most [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2468.3999999999996s)]
*  important aspects of this election has been 60% of voters demanding change, like needing change [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2473.2799999999997s)]
*  from the prior administration. Okay. A second point on that is that the majority, the overwhelming [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2480.56s)]
*  majority, not overwhelming, but majority of voters also say Trump does represent a change. Now that [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2486.48s)]
*  could be good. That could be bad. 28% say Kamala Harris represents that change. That should be a [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2491.36s)]
*  clear cut indication that there's a lot of people out there that want change and are not seeing it [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2497.28s)]
*  in Kamala Harris. The goal should not be to get those people to reluctantly go out and vote for [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2501.44s)]
*  you. The goal should be to at least say a couple things. Like I'm begging just a couple things. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2506.48s)]
*  I'm like reducing the needs and the interests from the democratic campaign every day at this [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2511.92s)]
*  point. It's just like, like, it's not bad. It is good. It is good for the election. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2519.12s)]
*  Freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2523.68s)]
*  do. An important moment that I had was back in 2004, when I was one of the first elected people [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2528.32s)]
*  in the country to perform same-sex marriages. Because I believe very strongly that the law [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2535.76s)]
*  should not treat people differently when it comes to being able to love who they love and the freedom [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2541.44s)]
*  to love who you love openly and with pride. Does Kamala Harris have kids? Yes, I have two. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2547.28s)]
*  Cole and Ella became my cherished children. Doug, my husband, I was very clear with him that when [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2553.76s)]
*  we started dating, I wanted to see how this thing was going to go before I would meet Cole and Ella. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2560.16s)]
*  You know, I'm a kid of divorced parents. It was important to make sure that when I developed a [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2567.2799999999997s)]
*  relationship with the kids that it would be lasting. I love those kids to pieces. They are my children [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2573.6s)]
*  and I'm very proud of them. How was Kamala Harris's wife as a child? I had the blessing of having a [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2580.08s)]
*  great childhood. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TABlwSojOU4&t=2586.32s)]
