# The Best Show You’re Not Watching | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc)
*  The facial expressions and the, the voice acting together remind me of like, maybe not even the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=0.0s)]
*  facial expressions because the facial expressions are even better than the example I'm going to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  give you. But the voice acting reminds me of like the free flow style that Rick and Marty early [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  seasons had. That was really good. And it was really human by the way, in freaking credible, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=15.6s)]
*  absolute banger. Let's see if someone can figure it out. It is an adult swim show that is on max. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=27.36s)]
*  And honestly, it has very little coverage, very, very little coverage on it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=36.56s)]
*  And I don't know why there is no talk around the show because it's a banger. Yes, everybody got it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  It's common side effects. Yeah, please. Okay. Just go with me for a minute. What if there were [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  medicine that could heal like almost anything. The artwork is amazing. The comedy is amazing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=57.2s)]
*  The voice acting is amazing. The caviar, the ghost orchid of mushrooms. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=66.0s)]
*  We spend more money than ever on healthcare and everyone's still sick. Think about all the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=71.36s)]
*  people who make tons of money just to keep us sick by keeping us unwell. This company, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=76.16s)]
*  you to Cal pharmaceuticals. Yeah. Mike is like, he's not even smart enough to be evil. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=82.72s)]
*  He's like the devil's butler. You know how bad my life is right now. You hear that? You hear that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=89.36s)]
*  voice. Yeah. Great. Now my room service is here. What is it about? It's about a guy who's like, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=95.84s)]
*  he's like a crazy mycologist, like an amateur mycologist. He's like kind of a brilliant guy, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=104.56s)]
*  misunderstood, who finds a mushroom that literally saves people's lives. Just like straight up any, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=109.44s)]
*  any kind of, any kind of issue you have, it saves your life. You can like evade death basically. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=118.24s)]
*  And it's, it's about him going up against the DEA and big pharma, like pharmaceuticals, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=124.88s)]
*  big pharmaceuticals and how much control they have over the government. It's like, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=133.2s)]
*  it's certainly conspiratorial, but it's really, really, really good. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=137.28s)]
*  What would happen if I brought this company like a new product? You mean like a drug? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. Kind of get me something by the end of Q3 and you can have my beach house. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=147.44s)]
*  Should we need up? It's kind of urgent. There's a lot of drama in it. There's a lot of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=152.8s)]
*  some people are following my tortoise. Yeah. Mike judge is the executive producer and it's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=158.16s)]
*  amazing. It is so amazing. I loved it. Highly, highly, highly recommended. And as you guys know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm a big advocate for like, this is not a, this is not a secret. I am a major, major advocate for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=173.52s)]
*  you know, healthcare and, and modern medicine in general. And this show is, is not just about like [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=183.84s)]
*  holistic medicine or whatever, but it is, it is actually more so about capitalism. It's a show [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=193.68s)]
*  that is anti-capitalist. It's a show that talks about how the profit motive should be nowhere near [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=198.24s)]
*  the field of healthcare and why it sucks. And I suspect that because it's such a good show, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  it'll probably get canceled. Like the other show that was a really artistic one was a scavengers [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=212.88s)]
*  rain or whatever. No, not scavengers rain. What was the other max show that, that was like aliens [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  in space and it was dark and scary and Netflix picked it up and I watched it and I didn't even [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=223.52s)]
*  know it was awesome. And I'm pretty sure that no, no wait, scavengers rain. No, no, no, no. Oh, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=229.52s)]
*  scavengers rain. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, that got confirmed for season two or no season two confirmed [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=236.4s)]
*  for a common side effects. Okay. That's good. That's good. Scavengers rain was the show that I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=241.52s)]
*  also loved that unfortunately got canceled, not raised by wolves. I watched raised by wolves as [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=247.52s)]
*  well, but this is, this is amazing. This is really, really, really good. Does this look healthy to you? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=254.24s)]
*  We have a chance here to change the world. Common side effects, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=263.76s)]
*  serious premieres with back to back episodes. Anyway, fantastic. Amazing. Was it made by the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  same team? Cause it kind of makes sense that it has like very similar movement. I don't know how [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=274.24s)]
*  else to describe it because it has a very, very similar movement in the animation. Obviously the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=281.2s)]
*  art style is different, but the movement that you can see out to there, there's little things that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=289.36s)]
*  I guess like I still have that, that artist dog in me a little bit. Right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  And so when I see, when I see certain things, like certain frames, I'm like, wow, like what [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  an incredible way to tell the story. Like I'll tell you, there's a, I'll give you a little example. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  Why this is, this is a fantastic version of what I'm talking about. This is definitely an incredible [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  cut scene that went viral. I remember watching this, not realizing that this was the show and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=324.88s)]
*  thinking, Oh, I would watch this show for sure. And a heartbeat, but here, right. I have one free [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=329.52s)]
*  team. I love their faces. I love the art style. It's like, it's, it's, it's weird. It's supposed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=335.2s)]
*  to be weird. And I like how weird it is. It's not pretty. It's on purpose. Harrington. Great. Are [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=343.04s)]
*  they any good? Look at the, the also, also, also, also, one other thing I'm going to say, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=348.72s)]
*  the, the, the, what do you call it? The facial expressions and the, the voice acting together [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  remind me of like, maybe not even the facial expressions, because the facial expressions [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=364.88000000000005s)]
*  are even better than the example I'm going to give you. But the voice acting reminds me of like the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=369.44000000000005s)]
*  free flow style that Rick and Morty early seasons had that was really good. And it was really human [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=373.52s)]
*  almost some animated shows don't achieve that. This does. It's so good. It's like very free flow, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=379.44s)]
*  real actual conversational. I don't know how the they do that. I haven't seen any of the latest [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  Rick and Morty episodes, but I'm just saying like initially before it became like this explosive [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  phenomena, Rick and Morty was actually pretty solid in terms of like voice acting. And it feels, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=398.48s)]
*  yeah. Waking life is a, is another great example of this as well. Like where it's like obviously [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=403.76s)]
*  conversational. Yeah. Capano. Yeah. Capano and Harrington. Yeah. Yeah. They're good. They're good. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  Come on, man. Jesus Christ. Look, I'm going to as they slammed onto it. This scene alone sold me on [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  the show initially. Yeah. This I watched it. I loved this and I never actually went back to find [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  out what it was. Yes. I'm not missing out on Lazarus. I know there was a stumble mention on [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=426.56s)]
*  Lazarus. Okay. Did you stop? I know. I know I've been watching Lazarus as well. Let me glaze one [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=430.8s)]
*  other show that I'm watching that I think deserves a lot of praise before you slam in Lazarus. Shit. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=436.8s)]
*  Anyway, common side effects is the name of the show. It's amazing. It's really fun. It's very [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=443.36s)]
*  funny. It gets dark at times. It's very thoughtful. Big, big, big recommend. Big time recommend. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=450.56s)]
*  It's like the opposite of devil may cry. This chatter says watch devil may cry on Netflix. Yeah. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=460.48s)]
*  The guy who made devil may cry loves Asmongold. That's all I needed to know about the politics [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=464.72s)]
*  and the worldview of the, of the show. Like we're over here. We're over here talking about, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=470.8s)]
*  about like actual fire shows that have an artistic vision that is elevated in its commentary. And [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=477.2s)]
*  you're like, here, watch this slop. I mean, devil may cry is fantastically drawn as well. Incredible [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=483.76s)]
*  animation, incredible movement. I'm not going to shit on that for sure. It's great. It's, I've been [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=489.44s)]
*  watching it as well, but it's just like, it's certainly like, this is a, this is a different, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=494.56s)]
*  this is closer to art house in comparison to devil may cry. Devil may cry is great. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=501.44s)]
*  It is not well drawn. You're wrong. I think devil may cry is well drawn. Common side effect [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=505.68s)]
*  is peak rebellion television and or to DMC has asked CGI. They get really lazy. Okay. Midnight [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  gospel genuinely gave me a new appreciation for life. You got to watch. What is this Chinese [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=517.12s)]
*  ministry? Chinese. I'm a face spokesperson Hassan on me. Thank you for the 10 gifted subs. I thought [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=521.28s)]
*  I got some military sentiment from DMC, but definitely not to the level of common side effects. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know. I haven't finished DMC. I can't speak on it, but it's good. I mean, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=535.28s)]
*  DMC is good too. Don't get me wrong. I just think that it doesn't hold a candle to what I'm showing [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=539.84s)]
*  you with common side effects. Common side effects is a must see I'm elevating into a must see status. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=544.96s)]
*  Where was I? What was I talking about? Incredible. And it was great. That's fine. I woke up early [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=553.2s)]
*  this morning, play some basketball, got my ass beat. Then I had to do a long ass interview [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=559.44s)]
*  with another newspaper. So I, you know, I had to end my ball session without even winning the game. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=566.32s)]
*  So I'm a little bummed out for that reason, but it is what it is. You got to do what you got to do. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's the reason why I'm late though, but I'm here. I'm live. I'm alive. Let's get it twisted. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  Don't get it twisted. Let's pop off. Have you played expedition 33? No, I have not because I [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=585.36s)]
*  found out that it's a turn-based and for something for me to, for, for me to enjoy a turn-based game, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  it has to be like Yakuza or something. Like I have to be captivated fully by the lore and stuff like [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=599.04s)]
*  that. And I don't know enough about what's going on in the world of expedition. And I heard that [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=604.88s)]
*  it's like great, but in any case, all right, let's, let's, let's pop off. Let's pop off. All right. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m-yFYjQJc&t=608.8000000000001s)]
