# What’s Going On With ContraPoints? | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ)
*  If it's not a topic touching domestic social issues or something that personally affects Contra, she doesn't give a shit about it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But it does. It does touch domestic issues. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  As I've said over and over again, the 60,000 comment was taken out of context and made sense in the context of what it was replying to, if I recall correctly. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Is that what happened? Is this why this whole event unfolded? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=18.2s)]
*  Because he made a YouTube video about this? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=22.0s)]
*  The death of BreadTube creator responsibility in Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=24.2s)]
*  From one of the OG BreadTube cra- [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=27.0s)]
*  Damn dude, this video- [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=29.4s)]
*  So how did ContraPoints go from one of the OG BreadTube cra- [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=30.4s)]
*  What is happening here? And there we have the heart of it all, drama slop. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=34.8s)]
*  I don't think Kavernicle is drama slop. What is happening here? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=39.5s)]
*  Just, you know, have other things in your mind you want to talk about and- [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=42.4s)]
*  YouTube is blocking ad blockers? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=45.8s)]
*  So how did ContraPoints go from one of the OG BreadTube cra- [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=47.8s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  I have the big Joel that I want to talk about as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=53.7s)]
*  To the subreddit discussing if they should- [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=57.0s)]
*  Completely ban her content from being posted there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=61.2s)]
*  That is something I want to talk about today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=65.4s)]
*  And this video has actually been in my head for like the longest time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=67.4s)]
*  But I made a decision a couple weeks ago, like not to make it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=74.0s)]
*  And I just thought it wouldn't be helpful. And sometimes- [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=78.2s)]
*  Holy fuck, that was crazy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=82.0s)]
*  That was the longest piss of my life. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=84.6s)]
*  You've got to use Firefox for YouTube? Chrome is trash now? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=87.5s)]
*  No, I think it's because the internet Wi-Fi is ass. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=91.1s)]
*  Ad block still works flawlessly on YouTube if you use Firefox. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=94.2s)]
*  Okay. Get braver, Vivaldi. I'm not going to do any of those things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=96.7s)]
*  We can hear you pissing by the way. Wait, really? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=99.8s)]
*  I was yelling from the bathroom. That was the longest piss of my life, dude. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=102.2s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=105.6s)]
*  He criticized their silence on the matter, but he also recognized that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=107.5s)]
*  they shouldn't feel compelled to do so, more like he feels they should have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=109.7s)]
*  said something a long time ago, but not now after months of being harassed [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=111.9s)]
*  by their followers. He was disappointed, but not surprised. Sounds like you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=115.4s)]
*  were frying chicken. I was moaning. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  I was moaning and frying chicken at the same time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  Oh, also my goat, Big Joel, had this to say as well, which by the way, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=124.5s)]
*  Big Joel is a great example of a content creator who also rarely posed, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=130.1s)]
*  like doesn't post that frequently, but as a, hold on, wait, hold on. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=137.1s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=144.9s)]
*  Cause sorry. Big Joel is the big Joel is the goat on this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=148.2s)]
*  I mean, he's been super, super fucking vocal about this stuff. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=152.6s)]
*  I mean, he's Jewish and he has never shied away from letting his opinion [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=156.0s)]
*  be known. He's the man. I have a lot of, I have a lot of respect for him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=160.7s)]
*  Also, wait, hold on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=165.6s)]
*  We got people in the building. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=168.4s)]
*  How about the things in your mind you want to talk about and other things [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=169.5s)]
*  were in my head, like how the UK is going full fascist because of it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=172.1s)]
*  It's war on free speech to protect Israel, things like that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=177.6s)]
*  But I've come back to it because I saw that Contrapoints was beef. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=180.5s)]
*  What is this fucking video, dude? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=185.1s)]
*  Why is the video just not playing? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=187.0s)]
*  Like I thought it would have buffered at this point to give me like a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=189.8s)]
*  At least a little bit of fucking at least give me like a little bit of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=193.6s)]
*  fucking range, you know, a little bit of check task manager. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=197.8s)]
*  Change the quality to 1080p. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=202.0s)]
*  It's on auto at fucking 480p right now and it's still not loading. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=203.7s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz on Twitter and it was, I think it's gotta be that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=209.4s)]
*  he sent it to them and this is something that seems to be only [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=213.0s)]
*  discussed right now by people who don't really talk much about Gaza [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=216.3s)]
*  and also exist in leftist video essay circles. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  Now I've actually called out people before not by name, but there [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=224.9s)]
*  seems to be some sort of correlation between leftists who are on [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=228.3s)]
*  nebula and leftists who have chosen to talk about leftist antisemitism [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=232.3s)]
*  while Israel are doing the worst crime against humanity of this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  century and one of the worst crimes in the post-war era. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=241.3s)]
*  I just find it really interesting that that is the case. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  But this video isn't me trying to pressure anyone to talk about [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=247.5s)]
*  Gaza because to me right now if you haven't spoke about it, I [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  don't give a shit if you speak about it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=254.1s)]
*  You've clearly made a choice not to talk about it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=255.5s)]
*  So I'm not pressuring anyone. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't want anyone to go to other creators comment section and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=259.2s)]
*  say why haven't you spoken about Gaza? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=261.9s)]
*  Why haven't you done this? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=264.2s)]
*  Why haven't you done that? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=265.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter by October. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  It would have been two years and they've had absolutely loads [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=268.3s)]
*  of time to do it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=271.3s)]
*  This video isn't some sort of pressure campaign against very [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=272.4s)]
*  prominent creators to do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=275.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think at this point the pragmatic thing is to just not [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  get in the way of people who speak out on this stuff. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=280.8s)]
*  So I think Contra points saying that doing this was like ridiculous [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  and it's going to breed enmity towards her. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  It's going to breed animosity. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=292.6s)]
*  I mean that's that's it's so crazy like you've already been so [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  quiet noticeably absent from this conversation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  I don't know why you thought that you would be able to like [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=302.2s)]
*  logically arrive at this like middle of the road position [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=305.2s)]
*  where you're like, well, here's why I was silent about it [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  because it's utterly unproductive and you guys cause [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=311.5s)]
*  Donald Trump to win like that is going to that is going to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=314.3s)]
*  shift attention away back to you in a very negative fashion. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=317.8s)]
*  It's it's so silly. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this was this was the initial thing that she [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=325.7s)]
*  tweeted killing 60,000 people is probably the worst atrocity [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=328.2s)]
*  of the last two years but in the scope of modern history [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=331.6s)]
*  is unfortunately far from unique. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=333.5s)]
*  It's obvious Hillary Clinton made the call. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=336.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, Hillary Clinton made the boss call to fucking a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=337.5s)]
*  breadtuber that makes one video a year. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, come on dude Contra points recently made a statement [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=345.0s)]
*  on Palestine and I did find this point the most interesting [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=348.0s)]
*  that was really the only outcome of the outrage over Palestine [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=350.5s)]
*  over the last few years. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=352.6s)]
*  Nothing plus slightly hurting Kamala's chances Americans [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=353.3s)]
*  have profoundly changed their perspective on Israel. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=356.1s)]
*  The average Democrat is more inclined towards Palestine [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=358.3s)]
*  than Israel. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=360.3s)]
*  Now, is that not is that nothing is our relationship with [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=360.8s)]
*  our greatest ally going to disappear in a day. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  It just seems like she's applying an overly narrow measure [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=366.7s)]
*  of success. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  I guess I just don't understand what activism is even it [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  exists to do or more broadly what human anger at injustice [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=374.2s)]
*  exists to do under such a cynical account of things. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=377.3s)]
*  I truly don't have an axe to grind with Natalie. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  I just keep thinking like I just keep thinking like Zora [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  Mamdani is a front-runner to be mayor of New York says [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=384.6s)]
*  he'd arrest Netanyahu was his victory was his a victory [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=387.0s)]
*  the online left at least kind of right more relevant there [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=390.2s)]
*  than with Kamala at least. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=394.0s)]
*  I don't know why I turned into Big Jules voice as well. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=396.8s)]
*  I tuned Big Jules voice when I was reading this I think [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=399.3s)]
*  being mad is completely understandable in this process, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  but you should be mad at the right people. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=407.0s)]
*  You should be mad at those who actually were responsible [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=408.9s)]
*  for Kamala Harris's electoral defeat and that's not the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=411.8s)]

*  It's Kamala Harris herself that refused to say something [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=417.5s)]
*  different than Joe Biden on this issue when it wasn't just [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=421.6s)]
*  the people that were fucking going out and protesting. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=425.3s)]
*  It was literally so many Americans that also were looking [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=428.6s)]
*  for something different from Kamala Harris. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=432.4s)]
*  They were demanding something different and she never did [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=434.2s)]
*  that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=436.9s)]

*  I want to say first and foremost that I respect you, but [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=445.5s)]
*  I have some pretty deep criticisms of anti-Zionist Jew. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=447.2s)]
*  I mean, this is a effort post from someone in her community [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=449.8s)]
*  on the subreddit. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=453.4s)]
*  I think if it's not a topic touching domestic social issues [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=454.4s)]
*  or something that personally affects contrast, she doesn't [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=457.0s)]
*  give a shit about it, but it does it does touch domestic [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=458.6s)]
*  issues as I've said over and over again, the 60,000 comment [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=461.7s)]
*  was taken out of context and made sense in the context of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=464.7s)]
*  what it was replying to if I recall correctly and [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=466.6s)]
*  unfortunately, she's right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=468.2s)]
*  It's not unique. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=469.0s)]
*  We've had technically larger genocides a dozen times in [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=469.5s)]
*  the last few decades, but that doesn't distract from the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=471.4s)]
*  urgency of this one. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=473.1s)]
*  If anything, it makes it more urgent to prevent it from [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=473.8s)]
*  going even further. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=475.4s)]
*  Also, it's not even 60,000. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=476.4s)]
*  It's certainly more than that the 60,000 the 60,000 numbers [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=478.4s)]
*  is a severe underestimate that everybody understands a severe [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=482.0s)]
*  underestimate at this point. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=485.0s)]
*  She said that in June. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=486.5s)]
*  And no the the there there are different there are other [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  conflicts that have taken place that are just as violent [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=496.29999999999995s)]
*  if not if not even more violent. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=498.7s)]
*  Okay, the point is we couldn't stop that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=501.09999999999997s)]
*  It's like saying well the indigenous genocide happened [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=504.3s)]
*  and we let that happen. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=506.6s)]
*  It's like well, we didn't you know what I mean when when [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=507.5s)]
*  people talk about other atrocities it feels or it's not [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=510.0s)]
*  even it feels you are when you talk about other atrocities [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=514.5s)]
*  that have taken place historically or even in contemporary [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=517.3000000000001s)]

*  a shit about any of that and I would have fucking stood [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=523.5s)]
*  in opposition to those who wanted to put an end to it back [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=526.1s)]
*  then and I'm doing it now. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=529.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=531.2s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=532.0s)]
*  Is it anti-Semitic or am I wrong to believe that the only [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=532.5s)]
*  people who can apply effective pressure are Jews who don't [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=534.4s)]
*  live in Israel? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=536.2s)]
*  No, no, not even it wouldn't it wouldn't hurt if anti-Zionist [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=536.8s)]
*  Jews were even more vocal or if more prominent Jews were [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=542.8s)]
*  anti-Zionist openly but there are plenty of prominent anti-Zionist [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=545.7s)]
*  Jews right now. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=549.2s)]
*  You know, they are some of the leaders in this movement. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=551.5s)]
*  Okay, but no this this relationship is not built around [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=553.9s)]
*  Jews with money that are or Jews in powerful positions that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=559.0s)]
*  are just like holding it together. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=563.3s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=565.1s)]
*  Did none of you listen to the rest of my comment or lose [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=566.6999999999999s)]
*  that other genocide being larger doesn't make this one less [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  urgent. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=570.0s)]
*  It makes it more urgent because we don't want this to get [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=570.3s)]
*  as large as others have been. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=572.6s)]
*  Yes, but also we have a direct involvement like there is no [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=573.6s)]
*  other country that we have such a direct involvement with. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=577.3s)]
*  Okay, Sudan people talk about Sudan. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=580.6s)]
*  I've talked about Sudan as well. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=584.1s)]
*  The rapid support forces are backed by the UAE. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=585.7s)]
*  Okay, who gives them the weapons and money and training and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=589.4s)]
*  logistics? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=593.3s)]
*  The RSF is doing ethnic cleansing in Sudan. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=594.3s)]
*  Okay, it's the UAE who gives the UAE backing we do but that [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=597.4s)]
*  is one step removed. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=602.0s)]
*  Okay, it is an indirect way of contributing to this ethnic [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=604.6s)]
*  cleansing campaign Israel is direct Israel is basically or [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=607.8s)]
*  the genocide in Yemen. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=613.5s)]
*  Saudi and the UAE, of course again, where are proxies there? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=615.5s)]
*  They were the reasons they were the responsible parties. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=619.7s)]
*  Okay, they took an ongoing civil war and and turned it [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=622.2s)]
*  into a machine of death and destruction. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=626.5s)]
*  We gave them the laser guided munitions packages. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=628.5s)]
*  We gave them the munitions in general to deploy it to on top [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=633.6s)]
*  of Yemen on the civilian population on the children that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=636.5s)]
*  they killed but it is not the same as Israel and the reason [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=639.8s)]
*  why it's not the same as Israel is because it is Israel is [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=643.8s)]
*  is directly involved in the domestic affairs of the United [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=647.8s)]
*  States of America in a much more meaningful capacity than [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=652.6999999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia ever could be and the same goes for the UAE. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=655.3s)]
*  Okay, this is the reason why people hyper focus on it not [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=659.0s)]
*  because it's you know, Jews and it's the Jewish state or [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=662.8s)]
*  something like that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=666.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure there are plenty of people who do feel that way [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=667.3s)]
*  because they're you know, maybe a little anti-semitic or very [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=669.5s)]
*  anti-semitic. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=673.0s)]
*  Okay, but the direct involvement that we have in the complicity [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=673.8s)]
*  that we have in the genocide in Gaza is incomprehensible. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=677.3s)]
*  It's not comparable to the Saudi Arabian activities in the region [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=684.9s)]
*  or the UAE activities in the region. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=689.5s)]
*  Okay, people at least up until now have not been threatened [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=691.8s)]
*  with deportation for speaking out against like Saudi Arabia [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=696.7s)]
*  or demanding an arms embargo to Saudi Arabia when they were [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=701.6s)]
*  doing a fucking genocide in Yemen. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=704.4s)]
*  People don't get fucking fired from their job. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=706.0s)]
*  You could say Saudi Arabia did 9-11. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=708.7s)]
*  You're not getting fucking fired from your job for saying [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=713.7s)]
*  Okay, but you say Israel's doing a genocide you're going to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=714.4s)]
*  get fired. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=717.1s)]
*  Well at least in the past and even to this day, there's still [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=718.1s)]
*  a tremendous amount of social pressure. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=720.9s)]
*  There's it's in the legislation. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=722.3000000000001s)]
*  What is this thinking about this again? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=724.2s)]
*  We will never be fully human beings. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=726.5s)]
*  Oh every time every day become more and more third-worlders. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=727.9s)]
*  We will never be fully human beings to these people just objects [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=730.5s)]

*  worldview fairly well. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=935.6s)]
*  I think it's not in any way shape or form all that different [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9wPX82VVQ&t=937.6s)]
