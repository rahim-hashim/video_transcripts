# The Truth About MLK’s Protest Tactics | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094)
*  white moderates were like, no, we're not on board with that at all. Now, of course also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=0.0s)]
*  MLK does not work single-handedly with like on his own without Malcolm X, the black Panther [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=5.3s)]
*  movement, right? Without the black Panther party. And those guys were definitely not [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=12.08s)]
*  nonviolent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=18.18s)]
*  They understood that there was a necessity. Oh yeah. Zoran also cross endorsing with Michael [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=20.94s)]
*  Blake. Michael Blake probably had the strongest showing. And if I lived in New York, I would [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=32.900000000000006s)]
*  definitely rank Michael Blake. He was spectacular in the debate. Didn't know too much about [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=37.86s)]
*  him, but he absolutely cooked. When are you joining blue sky? I don't know. Do you think [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=45.06s)]
*  the war with Iran is affecting how people will vote in New York is such a blatant display [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=50.86s)]
*  of its recklessness at the front of the news cycle that it feels like people are less likely [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=53.3s)]
*  to buy into the mum Donnie fear-mongering, but who knows? Maybe I'm too hopeful. If anything, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=56.36s)]
*  it's the opposite 77 K likes though. The CIA hasn't, it doesn't have to do anything. No [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=60.74s)]
*  Twitter left this death to America is not a convincing message to Americans. What? I [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=65.98s)]
*  mean, they're not wrong. Like, yeah, it's not, but it's not supposed to. It's not supposed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  to convince you. I saw something. I saw something on tick-tock that I thought was like actually [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  pretty interesting about MLK's tactics, MLK's protest techniques. And, and, and, and I think, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=80.36s)]
*  I think it's really interesting. It was, let me see if I can dig it up, but I'll talk about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=89.16s)]
*  this in a second. Like in terms of optics, this guy was arguing that MLK wasn't trying [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=94.28s)]
*  to get white people on board by having what the, this is the first thing that come up [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=98.84s)]
*  on my take-off. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=103.92s)]
*  God damn, look at this. This is as soon as I opened this up here, we'll start off there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=104.92s)]
*  We'll start off on the optics front on the protest. Obviously protests have been happening [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=110.44s)]
*  all around the country. There's a lot of back and forth in terms of like, there's a lot [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=113.08s)]
*  of back and forth in terms of like what the best possible way to protest is and yada, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  yada, yada, and what the bad parts of protesting look like, or what bad kinds of brothers look [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=121.24s)]
*  like I am in favor of protests and demonstrations. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=125.24s)]
*  Regardless, you guys, as you probably know, I don't mind if it's like a, like a lived [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=129.76s)]
*  up protest at the end of the day, I still think it's good. But here, this is a very [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=136.36s)]
*  short piece about MLK and what he was doing and what he was utilizing in terms of like [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=142.24s)]
*  optics. That it's, it's a, it's a type of, it's an attitude that I never really considered [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  as well here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=155.24s)]
*  Favorite tools to use was right. Like he never once led a nonviolent protest. People getting [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=156.24s)]
*  beat within an inch of a life ordering food is a violent, right? But he was a mastermind [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  in manipulating the visuals. He understood that watching black people get beat up on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=164.96s)]
*  live television is not an effective strategy at making racist people any less racist. But [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=168.6s)]
*  you as a black person having to watch your defenseless mother and aunties get hosed down [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=172.68s)]
*  is actually extremely effective tactic and raging both you and your local community to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=176.96s)]
*  right. There's a reason why after every major MLK city and peaceful protests got televised, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=181.12s)]
*  there would be widespread violent uprisings, both large and small all around the country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=186.6s)]
*  And this threat of widespread is what caused change. And there has been a lot of historical [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=190.2s)]
*  propaganda that goes into portraying the civil rights era as being the product of white [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=194.14s)]
*  empathy and not fear the dominant group in America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=198.7s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't those protests and like black people getting their asses beat at the civil [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=202.61999999999998s)]
*  rights sit-ins and whatnot that were inherently nonviolent on the protestors side, but there [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=208.42s)]
*  was tremendous against them on the police side, the, the, the, in that regard and the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=214.82s)]
*  imagery in that regard was not for white people to feel sympathetic to black people. They [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=221.94s)]
*  didn't give a shit at all, which of course, as you guys know, MLK also openly talked about [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=225.1s)]
*  in terms of like white empathy and how white moderates were, were a significant hurdle [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=231.02s)]
*  to, to, to developing a, a coherent successful civil rights struggle that, that had, that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=237.06s)]
*  had some kind of motion. Yeah. White moderates were like, no, we're not on board with that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=244.18s)]
*  at all. Now, of course also MLK does not work single-handedly with like on his own without [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=252.66s)]
*  Malcolm X, without the black Panther movement, right? Without the black Panther party. And [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=260.26s)]
*  those guys were definitely not nonviolent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=264.38s)]
*  They understood that there was a necessity in certain instances for a little bit of militancy [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=270.58s)]
*  recognizing perfectly that no matter how much militancy they applied, it would never reach [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=278.97999999999996s)]
*  the standard of the state, which is true. Like what they did, even if they were to get [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=286.58s)]
*  into like every now and then, or engage in the act of self-defense against the state [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=293.74s)]
*  that was like brutalizing black people, ultimately, none of that would reach the standard of systematize [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=299.3s)]
*  that the state was enacting with regular frequency under the auspices of, of lawfare. State has [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=308.86s)]
*  obviously a monopoly on, but in any case, point is it wasn't about garnering attention [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  from it wasn't about garnering attention and sympathy from white people, even though that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=323.46000000000004s)]
*  is how people talk about it. Like that's literally like the most famous way of approaching [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=328.3s)]
*  it, which is to, to whitewash the things that took place during the civil rights struggle [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=337.14s)]
*  and then making it seem as though it was like white people's sympathies that finally gave [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=342.74s)]
*  black people some, some legal parody that wasn't the case obviously. And this, this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=347.72s)]
*  perfectly demonstrates that too. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=354.38s)]
*  We're never overwhelmingly in favor of any of MLK's protest tactics, right? He forced [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=357.14000000000004s)]
*  their hand. You can either accept the nonviolent terms I'm offering, or you're going to be [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=361.26000000000005s)]
*  forced into a violent reality. It's not an appeal to empathy, it's extortion. And I think [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=365.02000000000004s)]
*  particularly towards the back end of his life, he started to make certain realizations, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=370.18s)]
*  That you cannot argue with somebody in a language they do not speak. You wouldn't argue to an [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  Italian man in French, you wouldn't speak to a German man in Spanish. So why are you [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=376.62s)]
*  trying to speak to a country that was built on the back of slavery and violent revolutions [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=380.5s)]
*  with peace? And I mean, we kind of seen how that ended, right? I don't know, y'all. I [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=384.3s)]
*  just think if you're a press or agrees with your method of protesting, you're not protesting [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  your loitering. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=393.7s)]
*  Yeah, there is a there is. This is why I always say like, there is a place for everyone in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=395.58s)]
*  this. Okay. Like even even the liberals, the barbers and the devas coming out and showcasing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=402.78s)]
*  their discontent with the current administration. That's good. That's good. Okay, so you won't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=407.65999999999997s)]
*  see me shitting on those guys. Like I'll make some jokes every now and then. But obviously, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=414.18s)]
*  like I'm in favor of that. I'm in support of that. I've talked about how I'm in support [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=419.26s)]
*  of all of that. But also, you won't see me poopooing other methods of protesting and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=423.1s)]
*  trying to dismantle or become dismantle certain pieces of the state or maybe become undeniable, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=433.7s)]
*  become a real nuisance, muck up the works, gum up the works to the best of your ability. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=442.7s)]
*  Like these are these are things that people have done throughout history throughout successful [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  protests movements throughout successful revolutionary movements. You know, you can you can play [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=452.82s)]
*  a role in this. Just don't stand in opposition towards people that have similar goals that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=458.98s)]
*  you have. Right? That's it. Did the lib lay down and take him on the police charge of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=465.86s)]
*  them? Not the ones that were around by the time I got there, they were eating it, but [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=470.74s)]
*  there's not really much you can do other than eat it when you're in that situation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=477.46000000000004s)]
*  Cause the cops are just like indiscriminately firing directly into the crowd aiming at heads [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=481.22s)]
*  in that crowd. So it don't even matter. Peaceful processing is good for getting attention for [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=486.74s)]
*  stuff, but it doesn't enact actual change. Historically, it doesn't work like that. And [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=491.3s)]
*  the other methods feel impossible now because the state is militarized rapidly against us. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=494.22s)]
*  You got a lot of numbers, dude. That's all I'm saying. Anyway, yes, I'm going to talk [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  about I'm gonna talk about the whole situation with the Iranian news broadcasters, state [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=503.34000000000003s)]
*  news broadcast being. Don't worry. One important note. He was operating an anonymous account [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=510.86s)]
*  in the Saudi government paid to Saudi Twitter employees to leak his information as well [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=515.22s)]
*  as other activists. Also, both employees escaped to the U S and they have active FBI wanted [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=518.78s)]
*  warrant. Will you be talking about Mike Lee? Yes, I am going to be talking about the Mike [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=522.5s)]
*  Lee situation based Mike Lee situation. When I'm talking about the Minnesota shooter who [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=526.02s)]
*  were, who was caught recently, that was one of the most insane things I've ever seen. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=532.46s)]
*  There was a lot of insane things I saw this morning. Okay. A lot. One of the funniest [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  ones I saw. Let's start with this one. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=542.62s)]
*  Danny Dunham, everyone's favorite anti child drawing UN ambassador to Israel. He said, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=545.94s)]
*  I am appalled by the outrageous and anti thematic incident that at the international exhibition [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  in Paris, where the boot of Israeli companies were concealed behind black walls. This discriminatory [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=564.42s)]
*  act singled out against Israel while representatives of other countries were freely allowed to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=573.78s)]
*  showcase their technological innovation. Yes, he does have a list by the way, for the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=582.14s)]
*  record, for the, for the real knowers, for the real Danny Dunham on heads out there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=589.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay. This is, this is as close as you can get to his accent. I'm not even bro. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  that in the shower. Israel stands at the forefront of global technology. And it is clear that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=603.82s)]
*  some nations feel threatened by our exceptional capabilities. This is especially absurd considering [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=613.58s)]
*  that Israel's actions are aimed at protecting the free world, including France and Europe [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=622.02s)]
*  from Iranian terror. Instead of isolate isolating Israel, the world should fend with us and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evpI8j2U094&t=629.58s)]
