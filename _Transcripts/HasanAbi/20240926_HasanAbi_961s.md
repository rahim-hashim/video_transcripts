**HasanAbi:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE)
*  that display. This is why Homeland Security must be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=0.0s)]
*  squared away. Yes. Yes. That Come on. Come on. Come on. Come [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  on. Come on. Come on. Come on, dude. He's dude, dude, dude. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=8.94s)]
*  The bobbins like that. This is why Homeland Security must be [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=14.86s)]
*  squared away. That's Keno. You can't make this up. Okay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=18.06s)]
*  And I'm excited. Yeah, Clay Higgins went full C earlier. He [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=22.1s)]
*  said, Hold on. Hold on. He said, lol. These Haitians are wild [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=31.5s)]
*  eating pants. Vodou. Nastiest country in the Western [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=39.78s)]
*  hemisphere. Colts. Flapstick gangsters. But damned if they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=45.86s)]
*  don't feel all sophisticated now. Filing charges against our [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=52.14s)]
*  president and VP. All these thugs better get their mind [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  right and their ass out of our country before January 20th. By [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  the way, that is literally how he sounds. If you guys didn't [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=68.1s)]
*  know. Unsurprising that Representative Clay Higgins is a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=71.54s)]
*  unrestricted, unhinged, unimaginable. Who could have [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=77.9s)]
*  foreseen this? Who could have thought that this was the case? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=81.98s)]
*  Well, I don't know. Maybe this kind of street gang is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=86.78s)]
*  responsible. Right? Except for this one's at a railroad [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=91.14000000000001s)]
*  anywhere. Right? Except for this one's at Auschwitz. Birkenau. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=93.9s)]
*  The expansion of Auschwitz. Where four more large were built. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=97.7s)]
*  Making 2000 people at a time. On these rails rode those poor [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  souls hauled in from all over Europe. It says many as 20-25% [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=106.86s)]
*  of them died on the train. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=111.34s)]
*  It's just like, how do you go? Why are you glazing this guy? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=113.82s)]
*  He's not a good person. You think I'm glazing this guy? Are [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=117.38s)]
*  you stupid? I'm making fun of him. Okay. He went to the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=120.78s)]
*  Auschwitz and was like, time to bust out my phone camera and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=127.34s)]
*  make a really compelling video about the horrors of the. Now, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=131.02s)]
*  now, this is like, it's just so like, this is why I always say [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=136.74s)]
*  this is why I always say, half of these problems will be [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=142.5s)]
*  solved if there was like half of these psychopaths would live [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=146.46s)]
*  way happier lives if there was an arts program funded at the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=151.82s)]
*  national level if there was like a federal arts program that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=156.34s)]
*  went in to the deep south went into places like Louisiana and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=160.06s)]
*  just basically told these guys that they could be the theater [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=164.9s)]
*  kids that they want to be. Okay, they straight out this guy [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=168.06s)]
*  would have never become a cop. He would have just been living [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=171.46s)]
*  with this living in his polycule. Okay, we'd be living [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=174.18s)]
*  in an objectively different world. He's just if I didn't [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=177.86s)]
*  know better, I would think this is a parody. It's funny because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=181.06s)]
*  he had to retract his Auschwitz video and apologize after [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=183.74s)]
*  criticism. Okay, this is when he went with I think Trump, where [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  he recorded a five minute video. And on Wednesday afternoon, he [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=193.5s)]
*  apologized for it. And he said, I filmed the Auschwitz when [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=198.66s)]
*  message with great humility, my intent was to offer a reverent [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=202.86s)]
*  homage to those who were in Auschwitz, and to remember the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=207.22s)]
*  world that evil exists, that free nations must remember and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=211.62s)]
*  stand strong. However, my messages cause pain to some whom [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  I love and respect for that my own heart feels sorrow out of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=220.38s)]
*  respect to any who may feel that my video posting was wrong or [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=225.58s)]
*  cause pain. I have retracted my video. Now let me tell you [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  something. Okay. You think he's gonna have a statement like that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=233.22s)]
*  about the Haitians? No, no. Anyway, the that happened in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=235.74s)]
*  Auschwitz were truly despicable. And we must never let history [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=238.98s)]
*  repeat itself in such a way. I have always stood with Israel and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=243.06s)]
*  all Jewish people. And I always will. We live in a dangerous [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  world. And massive forces of evil do indeed yet exist. We [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=253.38s)]
*  must all stand united against those evils. Anyway, he like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  deleted the video, but he literally got yelled at by the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=263.38s)]
*  Auschwitz Memorial Auschwitz Museum. Because chat this video [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=268.1s)]
*  gets so much worse. Let's take a look. Time to trip was seven, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=272.82000000000005s)]
*  eight, 10 days and a pool of water. Eventually, those who [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=275.54s)]
*  survived the trip ended up on this room. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=278.86s)]
*  Great sense of dread comes over you. Imagine being like, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  imagine being like a like a Jewish dude who's going to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=291.1s)]
*  Auschwitz. Okay, on a trip to Auschwitz to just like, look at [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=294.98s)]
*  the horrifying nature of the okay, and you're over there and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=299.66s)]
*  you're trying to like, really just take it all in about like [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=303.66s)]
*  the, the horrifying nature of these okay, and how serialized [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  this was. And you got this potato head. Okay, walking [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=312.74s)]
*  through the the shoe pile being like that's right. Because of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=318.18s)]
*  we must actually beef up our national security, you know. And [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=324.22s)]
*  yes, he did do that. He went into the ovens. He went into the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=330.38s)]
*  gas chamber. And that's where he actually delivers the riveting [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=334.82s)]
*  commentary that I just made, which is that the reminded him [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  of why we have to beef up the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=348.14000000000004s)]
*  In this place. Imagine Jonathan Glaser is filming the museum [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=354.18s)]
*  scene and this was just like, man, I was bad. No, he would be [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=357.98s)]
*  like, the serialized death and destruction, the mortality of it [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=361.38s)]
*  all. It made me think about tax cuts that we must give to the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=365.66s)]
*  wealthy that this cut is perfect to where like the video maker [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  Windows movie maker, but right there, cyclone, the actual cans [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  used 1.1 million innocent civilians here in Auschwitz said [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=382.26s)]
*  it was squeezed 700 people in here, bro is filming. And I [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=388.02s)]
*  repeat inside of the he is blogging inside of the bro. This [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=391.98s)]
*  is, you know, this is a Hassan Abiy like favorite. This is one [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=399.14s)]
*  of my favorite videos that any Republican has ever filmed of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=403.26s)]
*  Okay, it is so insane. But it is so incredible that he put this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=408.26s)]
*  together and he edited it. And I know while he was editing his [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=415.34000000000003s)]
*  tongue was sticking out of his mouth. He was like, like, he was [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=418.82s)]
*  really trying to put this together with his potato ass [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=422.82s)]
*  thumbs. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=425.3s)]
*  The guards would drop cyclone five from above two hatches, this [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=425.94s)]
*  cyanide pellets activated when they hit oxygen after about 20 [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=432.42s)]
*  minutes, everyone was dead. And then we'd go into the room and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=436.98s)]
*  drag us the bodies of those poor souls out and bring them and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  them in these ovens. There were three sets of ovens like that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=446.66s)]
*  No, I'm not adding this music, bro. I don't know if he added it [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=450.02000000000004s)]
*  or if it plays automatically when you go to that display. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  This is why Homeland Security must be squared away. Yes. Yes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=457.14000000000004s)]
*  That Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=462.66s)]
*  on, dude. He's dude, dude, dude. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=465.58s)]
*  The ovens like that. This is why Homeland Security must be [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=470.26s)]
*  squared away. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=473.46s)]
*  That's Keno. You can't make this up. Okay, you got this potato [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=474.3s)]
*  headed inside of the ovens, like inside of the goddamn gas [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=480.02s)]
*  chamber at Auschwitz. Being like I'm filming this entire thing. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=484.74s)]
*  And right now in this very moment, the one thing on my mind [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=489.82s)]
*  is that we must give more money to the Department of Homeland [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  Security. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  Why military must be invincible. This is the cell for [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=498.18s)]
*  prisoners in building 11 in Auschwitz. They would they would [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=504.74s)]
*  squeeze as many as 40 at a time men in here standing up to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=508.86s)]
*  squeeze them in to small room and it closes the door a heavy [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=513.26s)]
*  solid door. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=516.86s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, he's a Louisiana sheriff, you know, his [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=517.78s)]
*  ass doesn't give a fuck about and actually loves slave labor [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=520.02s)]
*  for the record. Let's let's be real for a second. Okay, Mr. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=523.14s)]
*  odd I did until they ran out of it and suffocated in that man. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=527.06s)]
*  Sometimes it take two or three days. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=531.18s)]
*  It also is hilarious is so close to his face here too. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=533.62s)]
*  This is why we must remember these things. Man's in humanity [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=538.02s)]
*  to man. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  I just wanted you to know that answer Cooper just said you're [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=542.34s)]
*  talking point about how migras commit proportionalism citizens [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=544.3s)]
*  of America regarding represent representative Higgins [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=546.74s)]
*  deplorable comments and I hope you know your impact. Now I [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=549.54s)]
*  don't think it's my impact. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=552.14s)]
*  Be quite shocking. The world's a smaller place now than it was in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=553.3s)]
*  World War Two. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=557.1s)]
*  Final thoughts on this day. Come on, dude. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=557.98s)]
*  United States is more accessible to terror like this. Horror like [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=562.26s)]
*  this. It's hard to walk away from ovens without a very sober [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paMEMDoLqlE&t=567.06s)]
