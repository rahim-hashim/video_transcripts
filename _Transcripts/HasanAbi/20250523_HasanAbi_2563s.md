# Israel Is Debating How Much To Starve Gaza | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc)
*  For the record, if you want a peaceable solution to the Israeli occupation and the end to the Israeli, this is something that needs to happen. This is something that needs to happen. This is how it happened in South Africa as well. People that recognized that South Africa had become a pariah state due to the endless amounts of legal pressure, the endless amount of civil disobedience and protests that took place. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=0.0s)]
*  In the Gaza Strip that are being slaughtered ruthlessly and being starved out by the state of Israel is. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=30.56s)]
*  Playing a playing into Israel's goals here. That is precisely the reason why yesterday Benjamin Netanyahu instantly came out and said saying free Palestine is akin to saying heil Hitler and not only that, but also. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=39.28s)]
*  Not only that, but also that you know the the leadership of the French government, the British government and the Spanish government were actually the ones who pulled the trigger. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=57.68s)]
*  By doing what by offering the most marginal of condemnations to the state of Israel for its mass starvation campaign. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  What a ridiculous thing to claim and the Canadian government as well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=82.96s)]
*  Stop them from getting to the Gaza crossing at Karam Shalom. So they held their protests at the side of the road. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=88.4s)]
*  All the pictures of the children here of Gaza and children that have been killed by our army. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=94.88s)]
*  And how does that make you feel? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=101.84s)]
*  I'm furious. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=103.28s)]
*  We are here to say no more. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=107.28s)]
*  There have been many demonstrations in Israel about the hostages still being held in Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=111.28s)]
*  One thing I will say about the changing of the attitude overall in Israeli society is that standing together is like somewhat comprised is probably the most is probably the largest group of protesters against the Israeli. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=117.28s)]
*  State that are comprised of some anti Zionist, but mostly liberal Zionist and post October 7 there were plenty of people that were a part of this group on been Bay of hard also known as standing together that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=133.28s)]
*  Actually took a very different tone. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=150.32s)]
*  On the occupation, not one that was of course in support of Palestinians at all. Having said that while the initial. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=154.0s)]
*  The initial protest that took place by standing together was one tiny and two comprised almost entirely of people that were waving Israeli flags. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Take note of the fact that one these protests are much larger now and two directly focus on Palestinian victimhood and three do not have any Israeli flags. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  Now this is still far, far away from the truth of the matter. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  They I don't think still consider it to be a genocide, but they are now entertaining the notion that they're taking place, which again is, you know, I mean, yeah, of course. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  Having said that, it does show a market shift in even Israeli society and popular discourse. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=200.0s)]
*  But it's quite unusual to see people holding up pictures of Palestinian children. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=210.0s)]
*  Of course, these people are on the left, but still there is a growing concern about what is being done in Israel's name. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=216.0s)]
*  Some on the Israeli left thought the war was initially justified because of the October 7th Hamas attacks, but now they see nothing but cruelty. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=224.48s)]
*  Although we are not the majority, we the reality is still the same reality of famine, transfer and expulsion plans. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=236.48s)]
*  The reality is still the same reality of famine, transfer and expulsion plans. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  Amongst the speakers, reserve is Captain Ron Finer who faces. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is pretty crazy, by the way. I really hate you had a take on this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=260.96s)]
*  In a Facebook post, head of standing together, Alan Lee Green praises Ron Finer as a hero and a wonderful person. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=264.96s)]
*  Finer served 270 days in the current annihilation war and just now decided to refuse and go to anti-war demonstrations. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=268.96s)]
*  He's also a member of ST's leadership. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=275.44s)]
*  Like I'm in favor of rehabilitation for sure, but goddamn, that's quite the expeditious change, you know. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=277.44s)]
*  He's 20 days in prison starting on Monday for disobeying orders by refusing to serve in Gaza. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=285.44s)]
*  Those orders are not moral. They are not serving the security interests of Israel. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=295.44s)]
*  The only thing they will bring is death of more soldiers, more Gaza civilians. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=301.92s)]
*  For the record, if you want a peaceable solution to the Israeli occupation and the end to the Israeli, this is something that needs to happen. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=309.92s)]
*  This is something that needs to happen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=319.92s)]
*  This is how it happened in South Africa as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=321.92s)]
*  People that recognized that South Africa had become a pariah state due to the endless amounts of legal pressure, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=323.92s)]
*  the endless amount of civil disobedience and protests that took place against South Africa and the Western world, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  and the condemnations that came from governments like the United States of America, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  who even Joe Biden famously was like railing against South Africa by the end of that process, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  led to South Africans themselves, like white South Africans that are beneficiaries of the structure themselves, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  changing their attitude in an effort to basically continue existing as a nation state. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=356.88s)]
*  That pressure internally certainly played a major role in the government also finally coming to that conclusion. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=362.88s)]
*  So the more people jump ship, even if it's too little too late, the better. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=370.88s)]
*  There are obviously better methods that I think Israelis could use in their own inside of their own government, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=376.88s)]
*  considering that almost every single person here is trained by the Israeli military at a certain point, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=383.36s)]
*  just saying, you know, but having said that, these things take time. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=389.36s)]
*  Change takes time, you know. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=395.36s)]
*  And our hostages. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=399.36s)]
*  I would prefer to not get punished, but if this is the price I have to pay for making my moral decisions and choices, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=401.36s)]
*  a counter protestor arise asking why they're holding up pictures. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  Chad, a stupid Israelis like me exist. Yes, there are many of us, but we do exist. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  So not all these leftists are fake. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  But you guys are right that most of them are sadly. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I mean, it's just for the record, for the record, for the record, for the record. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  Like I have obviously promoted much more radical groups within Israel in the past and interviewed refuseniks in the past. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  As you know, like Mezar Vot, which is a great organization, it is an actual anti-Zionist organization. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=440.32s)]
*  But the very fact that even like Ombim Bayakad now is entertaining refuseniks, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=446.32s)]
*  even if they have even if they were reserves for 270 days in the campaign means that like there is a tide shift that is taking place even within Israeli society. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=452.32s)]
*  And there needs to be a time shift that takes place within Israeli society for this to come to a peaceable solution. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=462.32s)]
*  Because in the absence of military intervention from a coalition of the willing, Israel is seemingly not going to stop. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=468.8s)]
*  And without America actually coming out and stopping Israel, there will be no military intervention anyway. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=474.8s)]
*  Palestinian children, when Israeli children have also died, we mourn both, she's told, before the police move her away. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=480.8s)]
*  Across the road, a small group who say that Israel must continue to attack Gaza were praying and cursing their enemies. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  The wicked will perish. Those who hate you will be destroyed. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  How does this contrast the polls we were looking at yesterday seems like diametrically opposite? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, that's why you must understand that this is literally a marginal movement. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=513.28s)]
*  It is a marginal movement that was already in the margins. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=519.76s)]
*  It went from like, you know, eight to ten people with with with no, no ultimate interest in like ending the bloodshed to maybe a couple hundred people with a real demonstration against the bloodshed. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=523.76s)]
*  Some were ready for an argument with any left-wing protester who ventured over. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=544.24s)]
*  We are not. You are taking babies under the ground and taking babies in your basement. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=548.24s)]
*  And you are a terrorist. Don't think we will not shoot you. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=555.24s)]
*  OK, this is very, very specific orders. The Arabs make terror and terror is a lie. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=558.24s)]
*  This literally doesn't make sense. Like these guys are basically promoting an alternative reality that doesn't exist. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=566.24s)]
*  Like the the internal debate in the fucking war conference and in the governing coalition is literally how much starvation is appropriate. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=572.72s)]
*  We're not even talking about like, you know, what the the rules of engagement are. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=585.72s)]
*  We're not talking about like what kind of what percentage of civilian to enemy combatant targeting capabilities are beyond the pale. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=591.72s)]
*  All of that stuff is gone. That's not a real conversation that's taking place. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=602.2s)]
*  The real debate that's taking place currently is are we allowed to give Palestinian civilians a drop of food or no food whatsoever and complete the starvation campaign? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=606.2s)]
*  The real argument that's taking place is between the Itamar Ben-Ghivir wing and the even the Bezalel Smotrich wing, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=618.2s)]
*  Bezalel Smotrich is now aligning with Benjamin Netanyahu and saying, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  no, we have to give them a little bit of food because the only hurdle in front of us from completing our main objective of complete ethnic cleansing is international organs of justice and the Hague. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  This is literally what the argument was. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=642.6800000000001s)]
*  This is the argument that that took place with Bezalel Smotrich statements that I talked about a couple of days ago. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, who is a fucking rabid settler terrorist radical himself, is in contest with Itamar Ben-Ghivir right now because Itamar Ben-Ghivir and his even further more radical wing claims that what must be done is the permanent starvation campaign of all Palestinians so they all die. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=655.16s)]
*  Whereas Bezalel Smotrich says we have we want to finish the job. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=682.14s)]
*  We want to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=686.14s)]
*  We want to do and they always say Trump's plan of permanent ethnic displacement of all Palestinians. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=688.14s)]
*  But while we are doing this, we also are running into problems with the Hague running into problems with Western organs of justice that are creating hurdles for us. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=694.14s)]
*  And therefore we have to offer at least a crumb of aid, albeit in a symbolic manner. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=707.12s)]
*  As Jeremy Scahill writes, Netanyahu Gaza aid scheme offers Israel symbolic cover to finish the genocide. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=713.12s)]
*  And they're saying it openly. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=719.12s)]
*  They are saying it openly. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=721.12s)]
*  When are you leaving Twitch? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=723.12s)]
*  I never in my life would have thought that there would be this many Israel dick writers in my chat, by the way. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=725.12s)]
*  Like I genuinely don't I genuinely don't understand because like this kind of this kind of like debate or this kind of conversation in the real world is not even taking place amongst like like Zionist groups. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=731.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=747.1s)]
*  Christian Zionism is bigger than you think. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=749.1s)]
*  I mean, no, I know Christian Zionism is your Zionism is massive. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=751.1s)]
*  It is legitimately shocking how many people come in here and and go, I hope you get banned. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=755.08s)]
*  I hope you get killed. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=760.08s)]
*  You fucking terrorists. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=762.08s)]
*  While I'm talking about the the insane things that the Israeli government is doing and admitting to like I don't know a single person that is this pro Israel in the fucking real world. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=764.08s)]
*  Here's Bezalot Smotish. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=776.08s)]
*  I succeeded. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=778.08s)]
*  The idea is finally conducting. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=780.08s)]
*  The idea I succeeded. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=783.0600000000001s)]
*  The idea of is finally conducting a campaign against the civilian rule of Hamas and not just focusing on the military infrastructure. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=785.0600000000001s)]
*  We are eliminating ministers, officials, money changers and elements of the economic and governmental system of Hamas. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=791.0600000000001s)]
*  In a few days, the American company will, with God's help, start working. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=799.0600000000001s)]
*  This is a direct war crime. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  OK, this is like a war crime on top of a war crime. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=806.0600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, it's a fucking genocide. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=809.0600000000001s)]
*  For all of you guys, this is not a surprising. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=812.04s)]
*  This is not a surprising moment at all. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=816.04s)]
*  But it's crazy that this isn't like a gotcha. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=818.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=820.04s)]
*  Which is why at this stage, when prominent members of the war cabinet are openly explaining their desires in the backdrop of a live stream child Holocaust, it is still shocking to me that there are still people who have the audacity to openly defend this. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=822.04s)]
*  I guess I expect people to have some sense of shame in all of this in an effort to, I don't know, not pollute their social media footprint and maybe create some sense of plausible deniability for themselves later down the line so they can act like they were always against this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=839.04s)]
*  But nope. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=856.04s)]
*  Turns out a lot of people are so high on, I don't know, whatever their own fucking agenda is, whatever their idiotic agenda is. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=858.04s)]
*  And for many, I guess it's just like simply saying I'm in the wrong and that I must be killed or that I'm a fucking terrorist, that they have no shame. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=866.04s)]
*  They look at the images of starving children. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=875.04s)]
*  They look at the images of Israeli politicians openly defying international law, openly stating that like they are they themselves are shocked at how little the international organs of justice or Western nations have reigned them in. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=877.04s)]
*  And these fucking dumb fucks turn around and say, no, it's good. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=895.04s)]
*  Fuck you for calling out against this. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=899.04s)]
*  Actually defending liberalism discourse is October 7th allowed itself allowed in itself a great moment for liberal intellectuals to finally reject the corrosive influence of Zionism from its ranks in favor of internationalism. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=901.04s)]
*  But they declined to naively because they thought liberal Zionism would win them any favors. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=913.04s)]
*  It's more liberal than all the things in the region is not more liberal than Lebanon or Jordan, even true. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=926.04s)]
*  Literally, it's not the notion that Israel is a liberal democratic state is so funny because like even beyond the apartheid, which is again something that you can't just like easily cast aside or the genocide that has taken place over the course of the past 19, 19 months, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=932.04s)]
*  Israel in and of itself has become an increasingly more reactionary society as a direct consequence of refusing to address the inherent contradictions of sitting on top of a fucking apartheid. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=950.04s)]
*  OK, it is crazy. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=960.04s)]
*  All it took for so many people to subscribe to this notion was one paired up with like an endless sea of Islamophobic propaganda. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=965.04s)]
*  All these Muslims are barbaric backwards rapists, yada yada yada. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=974.04s)]
*  And also Israel to just basically slap on a fucking gay rainbow flag, you know. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=978.04s)]
*  Like we're talking about we're talking about a society that that doesn't fucking allow interfaith marriages. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=983.04s)]
*  OK, and if you suspiciously if you're gay, you just have to go to Cyprus to get married. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=991.04s)]
*  Who knows why? Who knows why? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=996.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=998.04s)]
*  And and goddamn libtards fucking run around like it's a it's a safe haven, dude. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1000.04s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1005.04s)]
*  Even the pink washing is built on top of a fucking lie. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1009.04s)]
*  It is literally a religious fundamentalist state. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1012.04s)]
*  It's a religious ethnostate. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1014.04s)]
*  Why the fuck would it not be backwards? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1016.04s)]
*  And you disagree? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1019.04s)]
*  Of course I disagree because in Egypt we did an agreement with the same Muslim. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1020.04s)]
*  There is peace in Jordan. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1024.04s)]
*  We have peace agreements make security not military. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1026.04s)]
*  And when you say they they the children, the women, they are bombing us. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1029.04s)]
*  I think isn't pink washing inherently a lie, though? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1033.04s)]
*  No, because pink washing is like like saying America is like pro LGBT pink washing would be like showing the gay officers in the Navy. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1036.04s)]
*  It's not a lie that there is gay officers in the Navy. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1045.04s)]
*  The Navy's gay as fuck. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1048.04s)]
*  OK, but you're basically saying look at these homosexuals. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1050.04s)]
*  And don't look at what those homosexuals are doing when they're controlling a fucking F-18 fighter jet. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1054.04s)]
*  That's pink washing. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1061.04s)]
*  But in Israel, the pink washing beyond it is like is just like built on top of additional lies is what I mean. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1062.04s)]
*  It's not as like it's not even as like as pro gay as like the American government is. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1068.04s)]
*  It's a long war and somebody will give up. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1074.04s)]
*  OK, we are not going to give up because this is the land of the Jewish people. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1078.04s)]
*  I think the land is the land is off. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1082.04s)]
*  I'm going to leave you to to carry on your argument. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1086.04s)]
*  A few miles away in Gaza, they gathered not to protest, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1097.04s)]
*  but to dig out the dead and injured from the wreckage of a house in Jabalia destroyed by an overnight Israeli airstrike. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1101.04s)]
*  About 50 people had been sheltering there. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1109.04s)]
*  A baby and a child were amongst the dead. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1112.04s)]
*  Neither protests within Israel nor censure from European countries is stopping the Israeli government from continuing their onslaught. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1117.04s)]
*  The people of Gaza do not have the luxury of argument, just the reality of trying to survive. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1128.04s)]
*  Well, joining me now live from Tel Aviv, the former Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1136.04s)]
*  it had almost who was once in the same party as Benjamin Netanyahu, but is now one of his biggest critics. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1139.04s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1146.04s)]
*  When we see Israelis accusing their government of war crimes, of genocide, it's a remarkable thing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1147.04s)]
*  Do you agree with those people that that's what's going on? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1155.04s)]
*  Well, I may not use necessarily the same terminology of genocide. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1158.04s)]
*  I'll be very hesitant. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1164.04s)]
*  But I mean, who don't say they're war crimes today means that that people are going to start saying genocide tomorrow. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1167.04s)]
*  When you got fucking former prime minister saying there's war crimes about it's over. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1176.04s)]
*  It's in the fucking last stage. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1181.04s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1183.04s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1184.04s)]
*  It's the same principle behind the guy who started the Human Rights Watch, who is a Zionist himself, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1185.04s)]
*  who is a Holocaust survivor himself, if I'm not mistaken, coming out and initially saying, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1192.04s)]
*  give him hell, Israel. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1200.04s)]
*  You have every responsibility to fucking kill as many people as possible post October 7, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1202.04s)]
*  only to very quickly turn around and say, holy fuck, this is a genocide. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1206.04s)]
*  It's over. I'm so sorry. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1211.04s)]
*  I'm so sorry. I said this. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1212.04s)]
*  The reason why he said that is because the reason why he openly admitted that he thought what Israel's campaign, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1213.04s)]
*  he thought Israel's campaign of war post October 7 was just and it wasn't a genocide. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1221.04s)]
*  He said it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1226.04s)]
*  This was literally a year and a half ago, by the way, the Human Rights Watch guy. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1227.04s)]
*  The reason why he changed his attitude was because of the fucking starvation campaign. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1231.04s)]
*  As soon as that happened, that is like the most definable war crime out there. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1236.04s)]
*  There is nothing more aggressively a war crime than that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1243.04s)]
*  OK, because weirdly enough in the in the field, in the theater of battle, OK, you can still try to use legal limiters to say, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1247.04s)]
*  well, we have well-defined rules of engagement. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1258.04s)]
*  Sometimes people, you know, get outside of the confines of those bombing campaigns. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1260.04s)]
*  It's not really a killing field. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1265.04s)]
*  We just simply decided that you can kill 20 Palestinian civilians for one person that we have falsely declared an enemy combatant or whatever. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1267.04s)]
*  Like these are ways in which you can try to find defenses for your military. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1275.04s)]
*  You're cutting food, water, electricity to the civilian population that you are holding captive. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1279.04s)]
*  That's it. I'm not talking about Omar being a Holocaust survivor, dude. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1284.04s)]
*  No, I'm not talking about this guy. I'm not talking about him. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1289.04s)]
*  Sounds like you're reaching all the time, Hassan. You're reaching. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1292.04s)]
*  I'm reaching. I think being this stupid and having the having the right to speak should be illegal. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1295.04s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you. If you're this fucking dumb, just shut up. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1303.04s)]
*  Maybe you'll learn a thing or two, you know, I'm reaching motherfucker. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1306.04s)]
*  The former Israeli prime minister is like they're doing war crimes. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1311.04s)]
*  What more do you want to fucking hear? Like there is no counter argument to Israel's genocide. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1314.04s)]
*  OK, there is none. They have openly admitted it. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1319.04s)]
*  Leadership has openly admitted it. They demand more. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1322.04s)]
*  Reach for a fucking book. Jesus Christ. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1324.04s)]
*  One thing is obvious. What is done now in Gaza is totally unacceptable, intolerable and unforgivable. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1328.04s)]
*  We have to stop the war immediately. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1338.04s)]
*  There is nothing that we can achieve by expanding the military operation [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1341.04s)]
*  that can be of any value on the contrary. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1346.04s)]
*  We are likely to use the hostages to lose the hostages and to lose soldiers. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1350.04s)]
*  It will fall in battle and to kill many uninvolved Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1357.04s)]
*  none of which is something that worse this military operation. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1363.04s)]
*  We have to stop it and we have to try and come to some kind of an accommodation that will bring back all the hostages. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1369.04s)]
*  We've seen Nassim Yahu and his ministers attacking the British prime minister, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1376.04s)]
*  the French president, effectively blaming them, accusing them of anti-Semitism [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1381.04s)]
*  and of feeding anti-Semitism with their language. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1386.04s)]
*  I mean, what is happening to Israel's international relationships? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1389.04s)]
*  Look, we certainly disagree completely with this language, which is absolutely obnoxious and outrageous. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1392.04s)]
*  Great Britain prime ministers, Mr. Sturma, President Macron, Prime Minister Cardinal of Canada, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1402.04s)]
*  all are friends of the Jewish people and the state of Israel. There is no question about it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1410.04s)]
*  They may not be friends of the Israeli government. I'm not a friend of the Israeli government. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1415.04s)]
*  And the majority of Israelis, I believe today, are not friends of the Israeli government. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1419.04s)]
*  So, yeah, we are all victims of this very, very aggressive government. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1424.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is a captive of these messianic groups of extreme right-wingers, fundamentalists, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1437.04s)]
*  Ben Vier and Smotrich and their supporters. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1445.04s)]
*  And I think it is going to cost Israel a great deal in the international relations. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1448.04s)]
*  However, I can't criticize... [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1454.04s)]
*  This is the liberal Zionist position, which is so crazy to hear from fucking Ehud Omer. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1458.04s)]
*  Like, you got war criminals, you got former war criminals being like, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1463.04s)]
*  Yeah, the amount of the sheer volume of war crimes that Israel is committing is actually harming Israel's [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1469.04s)]
*  the harming Israel's clout in the fucking global stage is becoming a pariah state, which is true. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1476.04s)]
*  This motherfucker is not a moderating voice, Chad, please. This is not. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1483.04s)]
*  This is not a moderating voice. The very fact that a guy like him is the very fact that a guy like him is coming to this fucking conclusion [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1487.04s)]
*  is because the situation is that bad, cats out of the bag, you know, that's it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1497.04s)]
*  He's trying to present an alternative reality saying like, oh, Israelis themselves are victims. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1503.04s)]
*  Israelis themselves hate the situation when obviously polls show Israelis don't necessarily hate the full tilt bloodshed that's taking place. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1508.04s)]
*  They don't hate it at all for him. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1518.04s)]
*  He's even going so far as to say that Netanyahu's prosecution of this genocide, continuation of this genocide, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1520.04s)]
*  is also coming from his unique position of being captive to the interests of the right wing, the far right. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1529.04s)]
*  Netanyahu is the far right. So is Ehud Omer, by the way. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1538.04s)]
*  President Macron, Prime Minister Sterma or Prime Minister Kani or Prime Minister Meloni or the prime ministers of other European countries, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1544.04s)]
*  because I also criticize the Israeli government for more or less the same things. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1554.04s)]
*  So and I think that most of the Israelis feel like me. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1559.04s)]
*  They think that the war should end today and that we should bring all the hostages and there is no reason and no wisdom [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1564.04s)]
*  and no moral foundation for killing so many innocent, noninvolved people in Gaza. It has to stop. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1574.04s)]
*  The opinion polls keep suggesting, as you say, that a majority are against this going on. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1581.04s)]
*  But the Israeli political process does not deliver that right now and doesn't look like it will in the foreseeable future. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1587.04s)]
*  What opinion polls? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1593.04s)]
*  You know, you are a democracy in great detail. You know that sometimes government has a majority [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1595.04s)]
*  when everyone knows that the majority of votes in the parliament does not necessarily reflect. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1603.04s)]
*  The only opinion poll that gets like a serious majority of, or not even a serious majority, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1610.04s)]
*  but any simple majority of Israelis is factoring in one, the Palestinian citizens of Israel, the Israeli Arabs, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1617.04s)]
*  and two, it's not even about like what Israel has done in Gaza, but more so about releasing the hostages. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1626.04s)]
*  Because Israeli society by and large, the Israeli Jewish society, recognizes that of course hostages are not going to be fucking released [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1635.04s)]
*  unless they stop the bloodshed. So that's why many of the protests that you see about releasing the hostages, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1644.04s)]
*  the largest protests that you see, are not about ending the bloodshed. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1650.04s)]
*  They're simply about ending the bloodshed now so you can have a release of the hostages, at least now. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1654.04s)]
*  Then you can continue. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1660.04s)]
*  Reflect the attitude of most of the people. You were in a similar situation in Great Britain last year. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1662.04s)]
*  For most of the year, 2024, there was a government and everyone knew that labor is going to win the elections big time. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1669.04s)]
*  But as long as there was a majority in parliament, they could do certain things. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1678.04s)]
*  So, in the streets, hundreds of thousands of Israelis, day in, day out, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1683.04s)]
*  and we are taking all kinds of protest actions against this government, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1688.04s)]
*  trying to overthrow the government in a democratic manner, of course, by adding actions against this government [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1693.04s)]
*  and maybe also the international pressure and the attitude of countries which are known to be traditionally very friendship to the state of Israel. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1705.04s)]
*  British people, French people, the Canadian people, their leaderships, they never were against the state of Israel. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1714.04s)]
*  They are against the government and if they will carry on in expressing their attitudes, it may be very helpful to the public opinion of Israel. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1722.04s)]
*  Well, should they go beyond that? There are calls for sanctions against members of the Israeli government. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1733.04s)]
*  Do you think that kind of pressure would be a good idea by countries like Britain and those in the European Union? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1738.04s)]
*  I was going to say no. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1744.04s)]
*  I'm tempted to say something which might sound cynical. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1747.04s)]
*  If Britain will put sanctions on Benfiel and Smotrich, they will not be allowed to go to Britain. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1753.04s)]
*  And some people would say in Israel that better go to Britain and not come back. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1760.04s)]
*  So, I don't know whether these sanctions... [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1764.04s)]
*  I think that I'd not like that the state of Israel and the people of Israel will suffer from, for instance, economic sanctions as the Europeans are threatening to take. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1770.04s)]
*  And then Great Britain talking about the trade agreements with Israel, which may be cancelled, which will... [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1784.04s)]
*  Wow. Remember when I told you that this could be ended without any bloodshed whatsoever? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1790.04s)]
*  Remember what I told you about economic pressure? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1798.04s)]
*  Remember what I told you about how sanctions work on your allies? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1801.04s)]
*  They don't work on your fucking enemies because your enemies have designed trade to withstand sanctions. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1806.04s)]
*  I said that on October 8th, 2023, by the way. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1814.04s)]
*  It took 19 months for them to even begin to entertain. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1817.04s)]
*  In fact, the Israeli people, I very much hope that we will not come to that point. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1821.04s)]
*  But if we will come to that point, I think it will be clear that the guilt for this lies entirely on the shoulders of the Israeli government. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1826.04s)]
*  And if you're right that Israel may change its government one day in the future, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1839.04s)]
*  would you want to see that government delivering international law to effectively hand over Netanyahu to face criminal charges? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1845.04s)]
*  Well, my desire, and I think the desire of many Israelis, is that Netanyahu will disappear forever from the landscape of our political and public lives. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1855.04s)]
*  OK, so I think at this time, what we are interested in is making a political change that will bring back down this government [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1867.04s)]
*  and will allow more decent, more responsible and more humane people to take over. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1876.04s)]
*  And that they will be dedicated to what I think is the main objective of Israel to conclude once and for all the historic conflict between us and the Palestinians. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1883.04s)]
*  To proceed rapidly into a two-state solution negotiations between us and the Palestinians, which is the only possible way. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1893.04s)]
*  This is what I was trying to do. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1902.04s)]
*  He's saying to go back to business as usual when he was prime minister, because obviously you could continue dispossessing the indigenous Palestinians from their land of the West Bank, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1904.04s)]
*  while every now and then doing shit like Operation Cast Lead, which he did. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1915.04s)]
*  Remember, it's not Benjamin Netanyahu alone who said how much Israel benefits from propping up Hamas as the only legally recognizable entity in defense of the Palestinians. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1920.04s)]
*  This has always been the Israeli government's occupational goals. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1931.04s)]
*  You prop up Hamas as the only recognizable entity in the region in defense of Palestinians. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1937.04s)]
*  Hamas is a very difficult time getting international support or any kind of sympathy, especially due to the unlimited amounts of Islamophobia from the fucking Western world. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1943.04s)]
*  And then you pressure in the West Bank to further erode any chance of Palestinian sovereignty. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1953.04s)]
*  You take up more and more space. You keep oppressing Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1962.04s)]
*  Hamas being the only entity that actually fights back against Israel retaliates. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1967.04s)]
*  And then when Hamas retaliates, you control how high the fires get. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1971.04s)]
*  You control how you curb stomp the Palestinian civilian population once again. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1976.04s)]
*  Anyway, trying to do when I was prime minister. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1983.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, at that time, Palestinian leadership was to come along on this path. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1986.04s)]
*  But the moment Hassam came to control, full control, the region got even more screwed because the government itself was terrorists. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1992.04s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=1998.04s)]
*  No. What do you mean? Oh, the government itself was there is okay. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2000.04s)]
*  The Israeli government is a far bigger fucking terrorist than Hassam. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2003.04s)]
*  You mean Hamas? Is there any group that has ever been able to resist against imperialist occupation or colonial occupation that has not been branded fucking barbaric savages, rapists, monsters and terrorists alike? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2008.04s)]
*  The PLO was considered a fucking terrorist organization too. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2020.04s)]
*  It was actually the first practical application of the term terrorist ever used in ever used in official government documents by in the United States of America. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2022.04s)]
*  Far before the war on terror, far before ISIS, far before Al Qaeda, far before the Taliban, it was the PLO. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2031.04s)]
*  I wonder why. Anyway, remember, it's important to understand what the likes of Ehud al-Mir are saying. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2038.04s)]
*  Because this is how this is the exit ramp for Israel. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2045.04s)]
*  They will try to whitewash and launder, try to re launder the reputation of Israel as aggressively as they possibly can. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2050.04s)]
*  But that means that the genocide seemingly is coming to an end. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2057.04s)]
*  How many Palestinian children die in the process? That I do not know. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2062.04s)]
*  This is what the new Israeli government will have to do. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2066.04s)]
*  And I hope that the Palestinian leadership at that time will be compatible in terms of its openness to take part in this effort. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2069.04s)]
*  And what will be the personal fate of Netanyahu is less important in as long as he will disappear completely from the landscape of our political and public life. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2078.04s)]
*  Ehud al-Mir, thank you very much indeed. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2089.04s)]
*  Let's turn to the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza now. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2091.04s)]
*  And limited aid deliveries resume this week. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2095.04s)]
*  But the United Nations has warned that it's too little, too late. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2098.04s)]
*  Speaking this afternoon, the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, said the amount of aid being allowed into Gaza by Israel is nowhere near enough. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2101.04s)]
*  Hospitals in Gaza are struggling to cope with new mothers unable to feed them themselves or their babies. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2110.04s)]
*  A warning that this report from our Middle East correspondent, Alice de Bunkle, contains babies and children which you may find distressing. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2118.04s)]
*  What is to prevent an institution like Hamas from intentionally increasing the level of violence, especially in the face of widely accepted rhetoric that virtually excuse any misbehavior they may commit? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2126.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2133.04s)]
*  Openly admitted genocide, Hamas haven't committed war crimes. Did anyone say Hamas has never committed a war crime? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2135.04s)]
*  Hamas's war crimes are marginal in the face of Israeli violence, Israeli occupation that has been 77 fucking years long. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2140.04s)]
*  That far predates Hamas. Hamas's existence as a militant organization against the state of Israel and its tactics actually switching over from only military and police to targeting civilians in acts of what you consider to be terror. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2146.04s)]
*  That is literally all a direct consequence of Israel's own violence. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2161.04s)]
*  Something that you choose to be blind to. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2167.04s)]
*  Israel currently is doing a fucking Holocaust. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2170.04s)]
*  Okay, I'll use a different term for you. Maybe one that you can understand a little bit better. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2174.04s)]
*  Israel is doing a Holocaust to a population that is majority children. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2178.04s)]
*  Israel's targets are 70% women, children and the elderly. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2184.04s)]
*  This is before we even talk about the civilian men that Israel kills. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2189.04s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2192.04s)]
*  What is to prevent an institution like Hamas from intentionally increasing the level of violence is idiotic. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2194.04s)]
*  Hamas would never exist as a violent entity if Israel was not violent. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2198.04s)]
*  If Israel was not a violent colonial occupation built around the fundamentals of ethno-religious supremacy and exterminationist ideology. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2202.04s)]
*  It is a Nazi ideology. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2210.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2213.04s)]
*  Never understood the genocide allegations. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2215.04s)]
*  Honestly, you sound like a fucking German, dude. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2217.04s)]
*  You sound like a goddamn Nazi. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2221.04s)]
*  Perhaps it's because you are one. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2223.04s)]
*  Never understood the genocide allegations. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2225.04s)]
*  Honestly, this whole argument seems to hinge on that word. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2227.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2229.04s)]
*  Never understood the rape allegations. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2231.04s)]
*  Honestly, the whole argument hinges on this word rape. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2233.04s)]
*  You can say that about anything, you fucking moron. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2237.04s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2240.04s)]
*  And it's not just genocide either. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2242.04s)]
*  The argument doesn't seem to hinge on that word. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2244.04s)]
*  The argument seems to hinge on the evidence that it is a genocide, which is the worst crime. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2247.04s)]
*  There is no crime worse than a genocide. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2252.04s)]
*  That is precisely the reason why you try to fucking disparage this. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2255.04s)]
*  Very obvious, clear-cut legal term. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2259.04s)]
*  Genocide is such an intense crime. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2262.04s)]
*  Such an absolute crime that even a genocide does not justify a genocide. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60jsFjWSKc&t=2266.04s)]
