*  Woosan 21 a floating fish farm the size of a football pitch at two 45 meter long and 45 meter wide [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=854.64s)]

*  Why don't they just put the fish in the ocean makes them harder to catch. I think they can escape [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=889.52s)]
*  Yeah, it seems better than the stagnant fish farming but still crazy law. Okay, so Maya doesn't approve of this chat [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=894.88s)]

*  Yeah [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=971.52s)]
*  Here's the deal guys [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=972.88s)]
*  The endangered species act is the most efficient law that we have in protecting endangered species right now [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=974.4s)]
*  All right, it means that we cannot kill them. It means we can't import export them [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=979.2800000000001s)]
*  It means that we have to protect their habitat. It means we have to have recovery plans [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  It means generally it means that we can't harm them [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=986.32s)]
*  right [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=989.6s)]
*  Right now national marine fisheries service and the u.s fish and wildlife service announced a proposed rule to rescind the regulatory definition of harm [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=991.5200000000001s)]
*  Under the endangered species act and proposes the definition of take [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=998.8000000000001s)]
*  Instead let me i'm gonna save you the mumbo jumbo. I'm just gonna translate it. They want to replace the mumbo jumbo [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  Yo, you're so good. You're just cutting right to it. Thanks. Thanks. I cut into the chase. I like it [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1008.8000000000001s)]
*  This is good. This is good political commentary harm. Even if it's coming from a woman [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1013.44s)]
*  Which I obviously don't think women should do political commentary. I don't think anyone should do political commentary. Just me [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1017.2800000000001s)]
*  With take why because harm includes [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1023.0400000000001s)]
*  Significantly changing disrupting or degrading habitat because that would harm species right because they need a place to live take just means [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1026.54s)]
*  That they can no longer take them or that they won't take them right from their habitats [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1033.92s)]
*  It will just burn their house. Isn't that crazy? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1039.92s)]
*  It's awesome. No, it's just uh, we we we'll burn their house [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1042.96s)]
*  But we won't actually directly kill them in the process no house for you [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1047.0400000000002s)]
*  No more no more food for you will burn your food supply will burn your house will destroy everything [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1051.76s)]
*  We'll make it so that you can't survive and you you know, your species is eradicated [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1057.2800000000002s)]
*  But we won't do it deliberately and directly by killing you [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1061.76s)]
*  Cool. Yeah removing the definition of harm removes all the habitat protections that comes with it [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1066.0s)]
*  Why do they want to do this? Because it makes logging drilling mining, etc [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=1071.44s)]

*  direwolf direwolves [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3036.32s)]
*  Yeah, okay. Let's hear what my thing is. Is that the game of thrones? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3037.6800000000003s)]

*  What do you think? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3045.52s)]
*  So so okay, so there's this company called colossal [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3046.8s)]
*  biotech or biosciences the biotech company out of dallas [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3051.1000000000004s)]
*  um, they [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3054.8s)]
*  Released this piece where they said that they brought back the direwolf from extinction [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3056.1600000000003s)]
*  That is the first time that direwolves have held in 10 000 years [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3059.36s)]
*  I think that the controversy [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3063.04s)]
*  is that [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3066.0s)]
*  The way that they did it is is they did they had dna from direwolves from like spoles in the sea [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3067.6s)]
*  Which is sick from like 72 000 years ago or something [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3072.48s)]
*  That's very cool [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3075.52s)]
*  But they didn't actually like insert that dna into another animal and like make an actual direwolf [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3076.56s)]
*  They compared that dna with a gray wolf with gray wolf dna [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3081.28s)]
*  and they [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3085.36s)]
*  Genetically engineered a gray wolf essentially to look like a direwolf [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3086.88s)]
*  So they took all the traits that made it look like a direwolf and then put it into a gray wolf [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3090.24s)]
*  Put that embryo into a surrogate dog and then birth but they're calling a direwolf [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3094.3999999999996s)]
*  But it is it is an animal that looks like a direwolf. It's like so it's not a direwolf [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3098.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's technically it's no, I mean it's semantics, but no, it's a gray wolf. It's a gray wolf [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3104.0s)]
*  Gotcha did you guys hear about that? Um [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3110.0s)]
*  Forever ago, they they tried to genetically modify tomatoes to be more frost resistant and so they spliced in winter [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3112.7999999999997s)]
*  Flounder genes because they have this like antifreeze in them so that they don't freeze in really cold water [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3119.68s)]
*  So they they tried to slice the genes of this flounder into tomatoes [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3124.48s)]
*  So in this example, it would be like calling that tomato a fish [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3128.4s)]
*  Gotcha. Does that make sense? Yeah, it doesn't make it a direwolf [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3132.24s)]
*  I feel like a fish and a tomato are so different than one like a gray wolf [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3136.16s)]
*  If I made a human be hairy all over [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3141.6s)]
*  Um and have like a shorter nose bridge or whatever and it looked more like a chimpanzee [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3145.2s)]
*  It'd be like calling that human a chimpanzee just because it looks like [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3149.7599999999998s)]
*  How's that? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3152.56s)]
*  It's not the same [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3153.8399999999997s)]
*  better generally speaking though the the technology that's come out of this and the science that's come out of this could be [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3155.3599999999997s)]
*  Incredible for conservation. It could also be really bad. Yeah [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3161.74s)]
*  Remember just we're gonna we're gonna create the first aliens right here on earth. Yeah [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3165.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know. I feel like this is [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3171.04s)]
*  I'm such a i'm such a fucking luddite when it when it comes to stuff like this where i'm just like [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3175.04s)]
*  I would rather work on preservation and conservation rather than trying to [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3180.3199999999997s)]
*  Bring back species that we've made extinct. So they they have cloned for red wolves, which are critically endangered right now the same company [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3186.7999999999997s)]
*  So and they're doing work with northern white rhinos and a few other things they are doing that as well [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3195.52s)]
*  Are they gonna be fucked up? Are we gonna find out that there's something severely wrong with them? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3203.2000000000003s)]
*  these guys no the [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3207.92s)]
*  red wolves and the rhinos [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3210.56s)]
*  No, they should not that I know yet. We don't have any more rhinos [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3213.28s)]
*  Uh white rhinos northern white rhinos like [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3217.6800000000003s)]
*  We just like we just release them into the wild and they just start fucking up all the rhinos [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3220.48s)]

*  Cool thing though. Sorry. I'm not gonna go on a tangent for too long about this. We're the mutated superior rhinos [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3227.52s)]
*  There's like rhino racism, you know what I mean? Like the the genetically modified rhinos kill all of the non-genetically [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3232.0s)]
*  so [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3239.12s)]

*  Cane toads are invasive in australia cane toads are toxic to like every endemic predator in australia [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3250.4s)]
*  In south america where they're native to all of the endemic predators have like evolved a resistance to that toxin [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3256.48s)]
*  so like they can live with cane toads because they've had like forever to evolve that right if they [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3263.5200000000004s)]
*  genetically alter northern quills in australia [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3269.1800000000003s)]
*  It's just like one gene that they can genetically alter in australia. It makes them like 3 000 times more resistant to [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3272.2400000000002s)]

*  It's a problem that we introduced and so by introducing a solution to a human cause problem. Maybe that's cool [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3285.6s)]
*  You know, maybe i'm gonna be honest. I feel like the the genetic modification that we're gonna tweak on the on the what did you say? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3293.12s)]
*  the endemic species that are uh that are being [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3300.48s)]

*  Genetically, like elon musk. He has newer link. This is basically that [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3324.24s)]
*  No, I think it's it's mostly bullshit. Yeah, do not let elon musk do this. I just don't trust elon musk at all [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3329.04s)]

*  That's what's gonna be the moneymaker [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3428.64s)]
*  and then you get to gattaca [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3430.8s)]
*  Where the rich have like full-blown genetic modification and the poor [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3433.12s)]

*  But if I were to do like I would max out everything I would max out everything intelligence charisma like a fucking [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3530.96s)]
*  like a [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3537.68s)]
*  I don't give a fuck people be like no you have to make this balance. They're like, no fuck that charisma is very like [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eqvkq4FsM&t=3545.7599999999998s)]
