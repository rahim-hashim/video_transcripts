*  It was supposed to be a Christmas ornament and now I give it to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=0.0s)]
*  He actually made that. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2.4s)]
*  They gave these out at the party. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3.4s)]

*  It was in the gift box. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=9.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, they were. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=10.4s)]
*  In the gift box. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=11.4s)]
*  I was there, Hassan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=12.4s)]
*  I was literally there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=14.4s)]
*  Fuck! [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=16.4s)]
*  Okay, well, give it back to me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  If you're gonna give it to someone else, that was probably at the party. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  No, I'm gonna put it on the Christmas tree. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Boom. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=24.4s)]
*  Um, no, I think we might still use this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=25.4s)]
*  How do you open this? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=34.4s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=43.4s)]
*  There are some left. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=44.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna do that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=47.4s)]
*  There's meringue. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=52.4s)]
*  I ate that, yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=53.4s)]
*  Mine's busted. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=56.4s)]
*  I'm gonna open the noise. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=69.4s)]
*  Fuck, I need to update it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=83.4s)]
*  Update what? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=85.4s)]
*  No. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=86.4s)]
*  It won't let me use it without updating it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=87.4s)]
*  Gotta do it, man. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=90.4s)]
*  Two. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=96.4s)]
*  What are these? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=111.4s)]
*  Meringue with mint chocolate chip. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=112.4s)]
*  Um, did you bust it open? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=115.4s)]
*  Okay, I think they can hear it, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=121.4s)]
*  No. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=136.4s)]
*  The big one. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=139.4s)]
*  Let me see where the food is real quick. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=152.4s)]
*  Yeah, we'll make Ray do the autism test as well, Chad. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=156.4s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=158.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=161.4s)]
*  I wasn't. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=162.4s)]
*  I'm gonna have to pee. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=164.4s)]
*  I'll be back in a second. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=183.4s)]
*  Can they hear us? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=184.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=185.4s)]
*  QD is making the base. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=186.4s)]
*  This is the worst part of decorating trees, getting it straight and shit. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=187.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=190.4s)]
*  Well, I've never had a real tree ever. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=191.4s)]
*  This is like the first time I've ever seen the process. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=192.4s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=193.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=194.4s)]
*  I always had real trees growing up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=195.4s)]
*  I just don't do them now because I don't have the teacher. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=196.4s)]
*  Do they get really messy? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=197.4s)]
*  Yeah, they get messy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=198.4s)]
*  How long do they last before they die? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=199.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=200.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=201.4s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=204.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=205.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=206.4s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=213.4s)]
*  How long do they last before they die? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=214.4s)]
*  You can make them last like a month if you put a bottle of Sprite in with them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=215.4s)]
*  Oh, Sprite? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=216.4s)]
*  Yeah, because they're like sugars, they'll drink the water, but you have to water them [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=217.4s)]
*  and stuff. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=218.4s)]
*  It's like a big problem. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=219.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=220.4s)]
*  Wait, don't cut it yet. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=221.4s)]
*  It'll all fall. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=222.4s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, okay. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=223.4s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=224.4s)]
*  How about like, yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=225.4s)]
*  They're already dead. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=226.4s)]
*  I mean, like, until they start losing color. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=227.4s)]
*  So I'm sure they turn black. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=228.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=229.4s)]

*  I'm sure they turn black. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=234.4s)]
*  I'm sure they turn black. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=235.4s)]
*  I'm sure they turn black. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=236.4s)]
*  They're already dead. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=238.4s)]
*  I mean, like, until they start losing color. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=239.4s)]
*  So I'm sure they turn brown or tan or something. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=242.4s)]
*  Do the leaves fall off of these? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=246.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=249.4s)]
*  The needles. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=250.4s)]
*  They're called evergreens because they're evergreen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=251.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=294.4s)]
*  And then I'm going to hold it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=295.4s)]
*  You hold sheep's peas on it? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=296.4s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=297.4s)]

*  I would not try now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=366.4s)]
*  You want to try one right now? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=367.4s)]
*  Together? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=369.4s)]
*  No. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=370.4s)]

*  Thanks. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=381.4s)]
*  A bit of a, you know, jack of all trades, they say. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=383.4s)]
*  They do say that actually. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=387.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=389.4s)]
*  I say that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=390.4s)]
*  Oh my god, it's sturdy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=391.4s)]
*  It's actually sturdy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=393.4s)]
*  The tree is just crooked. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=394.4s)]
*  I think the tree is a little bent, but that's okay. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=395.4s)]
*  Okay, so. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=399.4s)]
*  Yeah, the tree itself is crooked, not the base. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=401.4s)]
*  Oh, I see it is. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=403.4s)]
*  Yeah, but like the base is straight, but the tree is like, it's fine. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=405.4s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=408.4s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=409.4s)]
*  Okay, let me see the scissors. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=410.4s)]
*  Scissors. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=412.4s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=413.4s)]

*  Wait. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=902.4s)]

*  Where are you gonna put that? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=923.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=926.4s)]
*  Wait yeah, we have another trash bag by the way. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=929.4s)]
*  That we can put under... [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=932.4s)]
*  Like it's not a trash bag but it's specifically designed for the pines. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=933.4s)]
*  Should we put that underneath it before you start stringing it along? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=937.4s)]
*  Uh, stringing is easy. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=940.4s)]
*  Well wait, you're getting caught on a bunch of shit there. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=942.4s)]
*  Well I know. It all got tangled unfortunately. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=945.4s)]
*  Where should we put this one? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=949.4s)]
*  Brick. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=951.4s)]

*  Right? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=954.4s)]
*  Yep, we're gonna go around and around. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=955.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=957.4s)]
*  Okay, ready? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=961.4s)]
*  So, so now we're on the bottom. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=963.4s)]
*  It's kind of just a shit show. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=965.4s)]
*  A shit show. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=967.4s)]

*  Alright, yeah! [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=970.4s)]
*  This way. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=972.4s)]
*  They're gonna s*** and s*** the tree out there. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=978.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=980.4s)]
*  It's too big. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=981.4s)]
*  We're gonna go around and around. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=983.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=985.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=989.4s)]
*  Like how much of a gap are you putting between them? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=994.4s)]
*  We have so much space that you can do it close. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=996.4s)]
*  Too much? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=998.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's really close. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=999.4s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1002.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1004.4s)]
*  Good job. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1013.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1018.4s)]
*  Around town. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1020.4s)]
*  And go. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1023.4s)]
*  Oh, just a little bit out of time. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1025.4s)]
*  Alright, I'm tired. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1027.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1034.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1038.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's good. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1041.4s)]
*  It's looking great. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1043.4s)]
*  We've got it everybody. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1045.4s)]
*  Oh, you can also check the camera and see if there's a gap too. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1057.4s)]
*  Oh, true. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1060.4s)]
*  I think there's parts missing, but currently it looks pretty good. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1062.4s)]
*  I think it looks alright. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1064.4s)]
*  Does it look even? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1067.4s)]
*  Those lights are nice. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1072.4s)]
*  They like the lights. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1074.4s)]
*  Yeah, they look good. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1076.4s)]
*  It looks pretty even. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1081.4s)]
*  We might do one more pack of lights. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1083.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, just one more. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1085.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1087.4s)]
*  And then we can just wrap it back in. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1089.4s)]
*  Well, we could just spread it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1091.4s)]
*  Do you want to open another one or do you want to? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1093.4s)]
*  We could go up. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1095.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1097.4s)]
*  I think there's a lot. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1099.4s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1101.4s)]
*  Before people think that we're not doing anything, we're actually chopping the tip of the other tree. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1103.4s)]
*  Okay? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1108.4s)]
*  We are doing things. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1110.4s)]
*  Alright. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1112.4s)]
*  That's the star of that tree. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1114.4s)]
*  The massive MAGA hat. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1118.4s)]
*  I'm just moving it for now. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1120.4s)]
*  While he gets the light sauce. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1122.4s)]
*  Should we? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1124.4s)]
*  Mara? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1126.4s)]
*  Could you get us that wire you were talking about so Ray can start making hooks? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1128.4s)]
*  Wait, one second. We gotta do this real quick. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1132.4s)]
*  What happened? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1138.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1140.4s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1142.4s)]
*  I know, something happened. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1144.4s)]
*  Well, it's not... [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1148.4s)]
*  No, that's the line. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1150.4s)]
*  Yeah, something's wrong. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1152.4s)]
*  We have a few extra feet. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1154.4s)]
*  Maybe we can back down. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1158.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1162.4s)]
*  So here we have extra feet in the middle. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1164.4s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1168.4s)]
*  Are you sure we don't go up? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1170.4s)]
*  Yeah, because up is covered. Isn't it? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1172.4s)]
*  It's downless. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1174.4s)]
*  Put it up. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1176.4s)]
*  Pass that. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1178.4s)]
*  This one. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1180.4s)]
*  There we go. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1182.4s)]
*  Why are you wobbling? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1184.4s)]
*  There's a gap right here. It's like bald here. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1186.4s)]
*  So then just pull this more taut and bring that around here. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1194.4s)]
*  Wait, why are we going up again? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1200.4s)]
*  What's that happening? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1202.4s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1204.4s)]
*  That's like kind of bald right here. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1208.4s)]
*  Maybe like this. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1212.4s)]
*  And then this. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1214.4s)]
*  That's fine. You can film it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1216.4s)]
*  Oh, that looks better. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1220.4s)]
*  It's enough. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1222.4s)]
*  Just a little bald right here. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1224.4s)]
*  Alright, Marron's gonna get the wire hanger thing. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1226.4s)]
*  Look how pretty it looks. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1230.4s)]
*  Damn. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1232.4s)]
*  Pass me that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1234.4s)]
*  Wait, I have something that I need to do. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1236.4s)]
*  The food is here, by the way. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1238.4s)]
*  Yay. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1240.4s)]
*  That goes on the front door. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1242.4s)]
*  But we have a suction cup hook for it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1244.4s)]
*  So Marron's gonna bring you little wires. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1248.4s)]

*  Well, these ones aren't gonna go on the tree. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1342.4s)]
*  These ones are just gonna go around. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1344.4s)]
*  Here. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1346.4s)]

*  This is cute. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1358.4s)]
*  You should play. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1360.4s)]
*  I think we have enough tree. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1362.4s)]
*  Well, what if you use this as the topper of this tree? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1364.4s)]
*  What do you mean, topper? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1366.4s)]
*  This could be the star. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1368.4s)]
*  No, we got the MAGA hat. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1370.4s)]
*  Never topped a tree with another tree before. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1372.4s)]
*  Oh, beautiful. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=1374.4s)]

*  I thought you were going to make some. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2147.94s)]
*  Make what? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2149.94s)]
*  Oh, I've been using these [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2151.94s)]
*  things for now. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2153.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2155.94s)]
*  It's all reusable. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2157.94s)]
*  Reduce, reuse, recycle. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2159.94s)]
*  Are there more [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2167.94s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2177.94s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about this real tree, but [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2187.94s)]
*  these trees are pretty great. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2189.94s)]
*  These are done? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2195.94s)]

*  Being [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2205.94s)]
*  oof-less. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2207.94s)]
*  We're all just sitting here doing your tree free, bro. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2209.94s)]
*  No. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2211.94s)]
*  I'm bringing you guys some pencils. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2213.94s)]
*  I mean, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2215.94s)]
*  is this not good enough already? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2217.94s)]
*  No, it needs more ornaments. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2219.94s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2221.94s)]
*  I feel like it's better than [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2223.94s)]
*  it's [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2225.94s)]
*  better than done. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2227.94s)]
*  Looks like a tree, bro. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2229.94s)]
*  Good to go. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2231.94s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2243.94s)]
*  What? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2245.94s)]
*  I was in the building. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2247.94s)]
*  I'm going to go get some [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2255.94s)]
*  green balls. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2257.94s)]
*  We're not doing the other side, right? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2263.94s)]
*  Because there's no reason. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2265.94s)]
*  But it won't [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2267.94s)]
*  topple over, right? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2269.94s)]
*  I'll just do four more [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2271.94s)]
*  blues and then we're done. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2273.94s)]
*  I think the more blue balls, the better. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2275.94s)]
*  Hold that. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2277.94s)]
*  Here, there's a blue one here. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2279.94s)]
*  That's kind of crazy that they don't send [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2287.94s)]
*  this, they don't give you hooks [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2289.94s)]
*  with this. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2291.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're supposed to be able to buy them. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2293.94s)]
*  Yeah, they were sold out. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2295.94s)]
*  There was a [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2299.94s)]
*  hook rating of 2025. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2301.94s)]
*  Wonder where all the hooks are going. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2305.94s)]
*  There's drones, maybe. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2307.94s)]
*  That's why we voted for Trump. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2309.94s)]
*  Took our hooks back. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2311.94s)]
*  Make America have hooks again. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2313.94s)]
*  There you go, brother. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2315.94s)]
*  Keep on keeping on, right, Kyle? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2317.94s)]
*  They're saying we need to make a zillion. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2329.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2331.94s)]
*  Can you? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2337.94s)]
*  Just tape a [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2339.94s)]
*  thing on the rock back. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2341.94s)]
*  I like her so bad. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2345.94s)]
*  I'm so cooked. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2349.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2355.94s)]
*  Well, we got to do the other tree [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2363.94s)]
*  too. Oh, I know you're not [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2365.94s)]
*  planning on doing it. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2367.94s)]
*  I didn't realize I had a hill on my face. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2369.94s)]
*  Damn. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2371.94s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2373.94s)]
*  It's a Christmas miracle. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2375.94s)]
*  Are any of those empty? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2377.94s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2379.94s)]
*  Did you use these? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2381.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2383.94s)]
*  Maybe just pop them off the top. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2385.94s)]
*  Here, it's like [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2389.94s)]
*  you grab a pack [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2391.94s)]
*  every day and just put it in the [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2393.94s)]
*  top. Wait, is that going to hold here [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2395.94s)]
*  or stick it back up the top? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2397.94s)]
*  It's like [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2399.94s)]
*  an admin box. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2401.94s)]
*  You grab a [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2403.94s)]
*  Zin pad. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2405.94s)]
*  It's like the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2407.94s)]
*  Hanukkah oil. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2409.94s)]

*  Here. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2431.94s)]
*  This is good with the batteries. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2433.94s)]
*  Do you have AA batteries? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2435.94s)]
*  Yes. Like nine of them. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2437.94s)]
*  Nine? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2439.94s)]
*  Those are for all the dogs. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2441.94s)]
*  And then I need a tiny little [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2443.94s)]
*  screwdriver. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2445.94s)]

*  Double A. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2457.94s)]
*  Double A. Nine of them. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2467.94s)]
*  Is that an impulse? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2471.94s)]
*  No, no. These are going to go in the [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2473.94s)]
*  other thing. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2475.94s)]
*  We can order hooks for [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2481.94s)]
*  that. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2483.94s)]
*  Is Amazon striking yet? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2485.94s)]
*  No, they ran out of [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2495.94s)]
*  Ethnic Sanctus this year. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2497.94s)]

*  the bows? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2549.94s)]
*  Don't tell me those are the hooks. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2551.94s)]
*  That's for the... [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2553.94s)]
*  There's only three. Some must be for the bows. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2555.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think because they're usually supposed to be on windows. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2557.94s)]
*  We don't need them. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=2559.94s)]

*  So we have our own like interface [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3647.94s)]

*  No, your biggest fundraiser ever was the... [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3745.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, wait. Yeah, I forgot about the Rainforest Gallup. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3747.94s)]
*  The biggest fundraiser ever, we got 250k. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3749.94s)]
*  Half of it was Hassan. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3751.94s)]
*  But I think it'll be cool. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3755.94s)]
*  I'm excited. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3757.94s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3759.94s)]
*  I haven't had a chance to do a charity stream this year. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3761.94s)]
*  And I like doing them. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3763.94s)]
*  Hassan does one every other week. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3767.94s)]
*  Nah. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3769.94s)]
*  Kind of. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3771.94s)]
*  The real charity streams is when [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3773.94s)]
*  Rachel allows me to play [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3775.94s)]

*  I don't know what happens. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3789.94s)]
*  Well, when you play it every day for 8 months [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3791.94s)]
*  that'll do it, you know? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3793.94s)]
*  At least one broken ball. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3795.94s)]
*  No, the tips, like, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3797.94s)]
*  they attach. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3799.94s)]
*  Ray, I can't hear you. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3801.94s)]
*  You gotta yell. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3803.94s)]
*  She said they... [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3805.94s)]
*  There is one broken ball! [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3807.94s)]
*  Kaya! [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3819.94s)]
*  Why are you so cute? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3821.94s)]
*  Alright. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3823.94s)]
*  Alright, this is like, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3829.94s)]
*  we're done with this, right? This is it. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3831.94s)]
*  Yeah. She was just doing this for the other tree. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3833.94s)]
*  Oh! [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3835.94s)]
*  Thank you for your support. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3837.94s)]
*  That's cute, though. We did a good job. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3841.94s)]
*  And then the dogs, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3843.94s)]
*  once you put batteries in them, there's a timer option. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3845.94s)]
*  So they'll stay live for 8 hours. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3847.94s)]
*  So if you start them at the beginning of your stream [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3849.94s)]
*  they'll be lit up for 8 hours [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3851.94s)]
*  and then they'll just turn off by themselves [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3853.94s)]
*  and start the next day at the same time. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3855.94s)]
*  Whoa! Like, they have a 24 hour timer on them? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3857.94s)]
*  Yeah. So just make sure you set it all the way left to timer. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3859.94s)]
*  You're gonna forget. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3861.94s)]
*  You're never gonna put the batteries in them, are you? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3863.94s)]
*  He's never gonna turn them off. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3865.94s)]
*  No, I already... [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3867.94s)]
*  No, I already ordered... [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3869.94s)]
*  Chad, if they're not on for stream tomorrow, you better say [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3871.94s)]
*  each of those dogs need to be lit up. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3873.94s)]
*  This is what they're made for. They need to shine. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3875.94s)]
*  They have a purpose in life, alright? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3877.94s)]
*  You love these goddamn dogs. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3879.94s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3881.94s)]
*  Especially the sweater one. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3883.94s)]
*  He's just so ugly. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3885.94s)]
*  I hate the sweater one. I think the sweater one has like an evil aura to it. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3887.94s)]
*  He's not evil? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3889.94s)]
*  Its eyes kind of have like a little bit of an evil vibe to it. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3891.94s)]
*  No, it... [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3893.94s)]
*  Just because he doesn't have pretty privilege. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3895.94s)]
*  No, the golden retriever one is like kind of fucked up. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3897.94s)]
*  I'm not... [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3899.94s)]
*  He just doesn't have pretty privilege. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3901.94s)]
*  No, his eyes look evil. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3903.94s)]
*  That is terrible. I'm not gonna lie. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3905.94s)]
*  I really don't like his accent. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3907.94s)]
*  Well, it's keeping him...his ears warm. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3909.94s)]
*  I love them. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3911.94s)]
*  Okay, I think I gotta freakin' run. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3917.94s)]

*  But if you had a motorcycle, you could get there immediately. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3933.94s)]
*  Unless I get hit by a truck. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHzGIAC8qU&t=3935.94s)]
