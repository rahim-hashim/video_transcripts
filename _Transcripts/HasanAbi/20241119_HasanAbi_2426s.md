**HasanAbi:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk)
*  Don't pretend that I brought it up. No, you brought it up and you made it a giant issue [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=0.0s)]
*  and you're the one hurting the progressive cause and the trans rights cause we went on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=7.12s)]
*  every goddamn issue on trans rights. Why are you going and dying on the Hill that no one [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=11.58s)]
*  agrees with you on you're going to ruin trans rights on other issues. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=17.44s)]
*  Okay. That's James giving and it's been happening for years and years and years. Okay. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=21.76s)]
*  Anyway, we're going to talk about the new trans panic happening inside of Congress. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=28.76s)]
*  Sarah McBride doesn't get a say. I mean, this is a biological man. He does not belong in women's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=38.72s)]
*  spaces, women's bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, period, full stop. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=44.24s)]
*  Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace introducing a resolution to ban transgender women from using [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=48.84s)]
*  the women's restrooms at the U.S. Capitol. The move comes just weeks after the first transgender [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=54.4s)]
*  person was elected to Congress. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=59.64s)]
*  Maybe shorter streams and diverse violence that okay, I'm done taking chat. I'm done. I'm done. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=62.64s)]
*  Shut up. Stop trying to offer me advice on what to do as a media personality, please. What is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  happening here? I know you're I know you're doing it because your heart is in the right place. But [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=73.88s)]
*  please. Okay, that's crazy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=79.64s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman elect Sarah McBride will be sworn in in January. She responded in a post on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=82.64s)]
*  social media. She writes this quote, This is a blatant attempt from far right wing extremists to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing. We should [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=93.0s)]
*  be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care and childcare, not manufacturing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=97.6s)]
*  scores. Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=102.56s)]
*  And that's what I'm focused on. Some of McBride's soon to be Democratic colleagues. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=108.48s)]
*  Maybe folks are scared and are reacting. I don't know to what me doing an extra podcast. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=112.68s)]
*  And the incoming lawmaker, Congressman Joe Morrell telling Axios, quote, I think we have a lot of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=117.4s)]
*  problems in America. I don't think spending time worrying about the restroom is an order of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=121.68s)]
*  priority here. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the move plain bullying. While [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman Becca balance said our panel is back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=131.8s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Green is asked how she will check who is qualified to use the restroom. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=136.04s)]
*  Congresswoman Nancy Mace has a new resolution that would ban transgender women from using the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  women's bathroom at the Capitol. Is that something that you would support or like what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  are your it's a brand new resolution that was just introduced in the last hour or two? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=150.6s)]
*  Apex do Sarah McBride with the same opinions on Israel's Donald Trump. Yeah, I don't give a shit, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=156.24s)]
*  what the fuck like, yeah, that's that's that's that's unimaginably cruel. That still doesn't mean [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=161.0s)]
*  that she should be victim to the fuck. Yeah, we're going to combat. We're going to combat the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=168.16s)]
*  coming from the trans congressperson by being transphobic. Oh, I hadn't considered the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=174.56s)]
*  Republicans might not be genuine. I'm a rookie. So that's a shocking revelation to me. Show me the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=178.72s)]
*  time Democrats even ask for suggestions on how to cut the Pentagon from me. You or anyone else in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=182.48s)]
*  their base. So I'll take a conversation on it. I said, Unc, I don't think a defense contractor [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  who happens to be the wealthiest billionaire on the planet is going to genuinely listen to your [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=191.0s)]
*  concerns about what parts of the budget they're going to cut. This is preferring someone lie to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=193.48s)]
*  you rather than one who doesn't even do that. Unc is unk is unk is ready to go. He's ready to fight, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  dude. We're squashing this beef on Jenks giving Jenks giving is going to be crazy. He is separating [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=203.88s)]
*  himself from you. Lemon fail. No, that's my uncle. Okay. Shut the fuck up. Like you're not invited. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=213.16s)]
*  It's at my house. What do you mean? You mean I'm not invited. Hello. Does he even cook anything [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=218.84s)]
*  good though? No, he doesn't cook shit, but it doesn't matter. He's an incredibly important part [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=224.68s)]
*  of Jenks giving. It's funny because like we he's going fully the client. First of all, no, he's not. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=230.84s)]
*  And secondly, that's my uncle. Okay. What the fuck is wrong with you guys? Like I don't think [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=236.68s)]
*  you understand or I don't know why you don't personally consider like this exact same scenario [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=243.24s)]
*  playing out in your life as well. Like, yeah, this, like some of Jenks difference in opinion [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=248.44s)]
*  than my, from myself. Okay. Is actually fantastic because it brings me closer to the true American [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  experience debating your uncle at Thanksgiving. This makes me so happy. God, I love Thanksgiving [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=260.52s)]
*  so much. I'm such a Ameribu. It is hilarious that people say I hate America because I love, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  I love the American experience and there is nothing more American experience than literally having [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=273.96s)]
*  a spirited and heated debate with your uncle who has maybe some right-wing tendencies. Obviously [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=280.52s)]
*  for most people it's like way worse. Okay. But the uncle nephew bond is undefeated. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=289.8s)]
*  And if you guys think that there is anything that could come in between the uncle nephew bond that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=295.64s)]
*  exists that is stronger than anything else, you are wrong. He was obviously not being serious with [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=300.92s)]
*  his tweeted Elon. I think he is. I think he does genuinely think he's just using Elon responding [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=306.36s)]
*  to him to, to bully the Dems. But ultimately I still don't think that like Elon is going to be [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=312.44s)]
*  responsive regardless. Except your Republican uncle runs a progressive news org. Yes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=317.8s)]
*  Okay. That's James giving and it's been happening for years and years and years. Okay. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  It's been happening for so many years. Are you going to have them on stream? Yes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=359.64s)]
*  The heated jank versus get them, get them, get them. That's all I have to say. No, you've got more. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=364.68s)]
*  Come on. I just, I just put the soundtrack. Yeah. All right. What else Marat? Get me. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=369.88s)]
*  That's it. Talk about it. Speak on a king. Sorry. I haven't watched, I haven't watched [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  Phil in forever. And yeah, this whole, he said, she said, I don't know what to think. It's not [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=381.0s)]
*  for me. It's not for me. It doesn't mean. Well, yeah, he does great. He does great. Yeah. He does [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=385.88s)]
*  great. He wins all the time. Yeah. And he's got great news. Yeah, I got you, but I don't, I don't [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=390.12s)]
*  get it. I just, I literally don't get it. Okay. Debate one by Marat. Okay. And there you go. TKO. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=396.36s)]
*  Okay. There you go. Jank admits he doesn't get it. I don't get it. They're telling me things [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=401.4s)]
*  that I think this happened. This began like a long, this began years ago, like back when we [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  were in New Jersey, we used to get together as a family in New Jersey for Thanksgiving [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=427.8s)]
*  in my grandparents' house that they sold. They don't even have it anymore. And, and it was, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=433.8s)]
*  this is not Jenksgiving. This was not a very, this was not a very spectacular Jenksgiving. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=441.64s)]
*  This was a little bit different shaky Gerga baby. Oh, here's the famous clip of the first [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=447.16s)]
*  ever Thanksgiving. This was, this was how many, this was five years ago. I think it was six years [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  ago almost. We're going to have an actual interview where I will ask you some tough questions. Okay. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to ask you some tough questions about what do you plan to do for CA 25. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=464.44s)]
*  But for the time being, all right, everybody, we got to go guys. He's flexing. He's flexing, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  bro. Your hair was curly, brother is still is, is wavy. I'm stopping the recording. All right. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=475.88s)]
*  We'll be back. Morat's angry. All right. This is the first ever Jenksgiving. This was the first [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=482.2s)]
*  ever Jenksgiving that took place. I am infinitely amused by Jenks seemingly earnest and entirely [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=488.6s)]
*  not self aware belief that major figures in both parties somehow owe him personally an audience [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=493.56s)]
*  and input into their decisions. Like not as an equal citizen, but as a semi-successful media [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=497.72s)]
*  brand, very delusional. Okay. I have an issue with that. I take issue with that. He is, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=502.2s)]
*  I take issue with what Adam Johnson is saying because shaky Gerga has had an impact on the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=507.56s)]
*  democratic party. Okay. All jokes aside, he literally did. I mean, him and Kyle were [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=515.48s)]
*  formative figureheads in the formative figureheads in the fucking justice Democrats, like all of the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=520.28s)]
*  progressive squad members that were elected, like they came from the justice Democrats movement. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=528.36s)]
*  They created that. They did do that. They were very important. Like their current or not Kyle, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=533.24s)]
*  but Jenks current positions on police immigration or his, his like concessions on some of this trans [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=538.84s)]
*  reactionary trans panic does not change that. And now you got Brianna with the justice dams. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  Is she still there? Why are you pronouncing his name like that? Is this a weird new [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=551.4s)]
*  Islamophobic angle you're trying out? Oh, shaky Gerga. No, it's just for years and years, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=556.12s)]
*  I've heard people mispronounce my uncle's name. Okay. But I've never heard shaky Gerga before. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=562.92s)]
*  And until, until I found a fucking one of those like weirdo in cell podcast, those weirdo in cell [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=569.08s)]
*  podcast who referred to him as shaky Gerga. And it was the most insane way to refer to him [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=576.68s)]
*  that it stuck with me. I cannot wait to show him that clip by the way, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=583.56s)]
*  because I don't know if he knows what shaky Gerga is. Yeah, here's the tick tock. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  You appear to have a crush on Hassan Abiy. Is that correct? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=592.92s)]
*  Yes. If he ever watches this, I'm sorry. Sorry for what? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=596.12s)]
*  For being on here. He hates it. Why? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=599.8s)]
*  He's a socialist and he knows the formula of the podcast. I'm not going to go into, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=601.88s)]
*  you know, you understand. It's possible that because he's such a low tier, low brow debater. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=606.92s)]
*  He's not a debater and he's been very clear that he doesn't. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=611.88s)]
*  Because he's literally a so it doesn't surprise me. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=615.56s)]
*  I completely disagree. He doesn't say that he's the smartest person. He's a, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=618.52s)]
*  he's an internet personality who is connected to shaky Gerga. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=622.68s)]
*  Shaky Gerga. Yeah. Shaky Gerga. What the hell, man? What the fuck is shaky Gerga? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=627.72s)]
*  Huh? What do you see your own getting owned by Dominic Tarzinski? I did not. And I don't [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=637.16s)]
*  want to, I don't want to see it. This dude called you a moron and then say shaky Gerga. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=647.0s)]
*  I always it's clear to me that the man on the whatever podcast who was tasked with being [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  a creepy sexual harasser, but in a debating fashion to all the ladies that they hire to be [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=658.12s)]
*  on the podcast to be ritualistically humiliated is the actual beacon of intellect. Hey, low tier, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=664.52s)]

*  that? That's crazy. All Ottoman emperors at Balkan moms just wait. He will revert it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=725.4s)]
*  And why you and you will see trust all lost plan. True. True. And to be honest, to be honest, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=733.96s)]
*  he does have, he does have the, the like physical structure of a, of a Dave Schieteman, like [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=742.2s)]
*  that's what the Ottomans did when they were like enslaving the white kids. They would literally [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=750.9200000000001s)]
*  look for like tall ones. You know what I mean? Tom motherfuckers like Baron. So he does, he is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=755.24s)]
*  someone who could reach up to the highest ranks within the Ottoman empire. Like Ottoman emperors, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=761.72s)]
*  all nothing new. Baron is a Sultan in the making. New York is the empire state. The sun will rise [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=768.44s)]
*  in the West. He will convert to Islam at NYU and make America a caliphate with a capital in [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=772.12s)]
*  California. The new on the loose inshallah brothers, as it has been written, it shall be [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=777.0s)]
*  a song for the love of God. Stop glazing a fallen empire. It's only fallen if you let it fall. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=783.8s)]
*  If it rises once again from the ashes in your heart, like a Phoenix in all of its glory, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=789.96s)]
*  restoring its former glory of the caliphate that it will bring to the Western world. Then, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=796.52s)]
*  you know, it has not fallen at all. Now think about it like that. Dr. Oz in charge of Medicare [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=803.48s)]
*  and Medicaid, Boris Johnson was the prime minister. He's an Ottoman son. And now you have someone who [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  will become the next vizier. Yeah, it hasn't fallen. It's just hibernating. Everybody shut up. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  Anyway, let's get back to Marjorie and Titan Green. Obviously, immediately, the Republican [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=822.12s)]
*  congresspersons have been like, Oh, how can we get like super transphobic for no fucking reason? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=831.16s)]
*  This is how Congresswoman Nancy Mace has a new resolution that would ban transgender women from [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=837.5600000000001s)]
*  using the women's bathroom at the Capitol. Is that something that you would support or like what are [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=843.08s)]
*  it's a brand new resolution that was just introduced in the last hour or two? Oh, gotcha. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=849.4s)]
*  I support a resolution that keeps all biological men out of women's bathrooms, locker rooms, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=854.44s)]
*  and private places. Not only here in the Capitol complex, our office buildings, but all taxpayer [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  funded facilities. How does one, I guess, I guess the logistics question would be how does one check [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=868.36s)]
*  like if someone is qualified to use the ladies room then in that case, obviously, there's a new [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=874.2800000000001s)]
*  openly transgender member of Congress, but it's more general. He's a man. He's a biological male. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=878.44s)]
*  So he is not allowed to use our women's restrooms, our women's gym, our locker rooms, and our [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=884.6s)]
*  How can you legally dress like this and be in Congress? Oh my God. Okay, first of all, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=891.96s)]
*  it's very impressive that ever since the incident, Marjorie Titan Green has been able to dress [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=897.32s)]
*  herself. Sometimes it doesn't look good. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be celebrating this [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=903.24s)]
*  impressive accomplishment. Good job, Marjorie. You're doing a great job. Okay, you're doing a great [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=910.2s)]
*  job. And we are proud of you. Okay. We are proud of you, Marjorie. Don't listen to the naysayers. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=917.08s)]
*  Baby steps. Okay, she's putting that shit on. Okay, I wouldn't go that fucking far. Calm down. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=927.64s)]
*  Spaces that are specified for women. He's a biological male. He has plenty of places he can [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=933.24s)]
*  go. Okay. And should they make like, I guess like gender neutral bathrooms, I guess, like logistically [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=940.52s)]
*  wait, Baron was born March, 2006, Milani became a citizen in July, 2006. He can be aborted to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=945.48s)]
*  God damn. And he has a bathroom in his office, just like all of us do. And that's where, you know, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=955.24s)]
*  I use the restroom most of the time in my office. If he has a bathroom that'll be, you know, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=962.2s)]
*  designated for him. But, you know, men need to, they need to respect our spaces. And that's what [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=968.12s)]
*  this election was all about. This was a mandate from the American people that are not only fed [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=974.44s)]
*  up with the open borders, they're fed up with inflation, they're put up with the economy, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=979.24s)]
*  but they're fed up with the left shoving their sick trans ideology down our throats and invading [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=982.84s)]
*  our spaces and our women's sports. So sorry for the uncomfortable question, but I'm giving you [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=988.92s)]
*  the direct answer. The American people spoke at the election, they're sick of this shit. And so [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=994.04s)]
*  the new member of Congress that was voted in the Congress on behalf of his district in Delaware [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=999.4s)]
*  needs to respect my space, my privacy, and other women's space and privacy because he is not a woman. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1005.64s)]
*  My theory that the biggest, the biggest transphobes also do not fit the traditional [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1012.2s)]
*  gender binary standards themselves still holds. I mean, for Marjorie, it's a little unique because [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1020.6800000000001s)]
*  she doesn't even fit the standard of a human being really more so just like a Titan from Attack on [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1027.8s)]
*  Titan. But it's always, it's always these demonic weirdos who are like, that's a man. How can you [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1033.4s)]
*  tell? We can always tell. It's like, what do you mean we can always tell? You're about to get [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1043.72s)]
*  trans panic defensed. Like what the fuck are you talking about? Why are you, why are you uplifting [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1048.76s)]
*  a standard that you don't abide by? It makes no sense. It makes no sense. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1055.08s)]
*  And then here is my favorite swinger in Congress, Nancy Mace. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1064.12s)]
*  I'm once again firmly committed to less bisexual visibility in Congress and in general. Nancy, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1071.32s)]
*  Mace, our bisexual congressperson who authored the bill. She is a bisexual swinger for those of you [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1079.0s)]
*  who do not know. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1086.68s)]
*  male, she should use the men's restroom. What sports are they doing in the women's bathroom? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1109.0800000000002s)]
*  Olympic shitting and farting. How would, what's the mechanism for wait, they split. Oh my God. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1114.2s)]
*  Oh my God. They split. Remember when she went in front of a church and was like, my husband is [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1122.2s)]
*  laying thick pipe in my butt or whatever the fuck she was like, I'm having the most amount of sex [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  all the time. And everyone at the church, everyone at the fucking at the prayer breakfast was like, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1135.96s)]
*  what the fuck did you just say? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1141.24s)]
*  Yeah. Seven, I was getting picked up at seven 45, Patrick, my fiance tried to pull me by my waist [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1146.44s)]
*  over this morning and then I was like, no baby, we don't got time for that this morning. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1153.4s)]
*  I got to get to the prayer breakfast and I got to be on time and a little TMI, but I, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1157.72s)]
*  I know he can wait. He's got, we got, I'll see him later tonight. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1165.08s)]
*  Like that's crazy. That is a fucking nutty thing. Oh, also Nancy Mase is like that Seinfeld character [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1168.2s)]
*  of the woman with multiple faces. She literally, I've never seen someone like her before where [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1177.4s)]
*  she just looks different in every photo in every different angle. Anyway, let's see what the ABC [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1183.0s)]
*  reporter had to say about this new transphobic bill. Congresswoman Mase, can I ask you a question [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1189.24s)]
*  as you walk here? So the question is with your piece of legislation about banning women from using [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1196.52s)]
*  my question to you is it doesn't go far enough. You filing more bills. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1204.68s)]
*  It doesn't go far enough. What do you, what's, what's the next step? I've said that it was [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1208.36s)]
*  created in response to Congresswoman McBride. 100% and it should legislation be created. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1213.56s)]
*  She looks like a different person because I don't know what it is. Maybe she's got like [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1219.24s)]
*  hellish sharp angles or something, or maybe she's just like a shape shifter, but she, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1223.4s)]
*  she looks like an entirely different person and like pretty much every fucking angle is crazy. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1229.32s)]
*  Targeted at one specific person. It doesn't mention anyone in the legislation, but you've said it was [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1235.56s)]
*  aimed at her. No, I have said it's a result of this. I'm not going to allow biological men into [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1240.1200000000001s)]

*  left who thinks that it's okay for a penis to be in a woman's locker room or a bathroom or a changing [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1249.72s)]

*  I love this because like, this is the butchest lesbian Trump supporter woman. The archetype was [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1271.48s)]

*  the transphobia narratives, you will inevitably become a transvestigator. It is the final state [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1422.12s)]
*  of transphobia. Private spaces with men is not dignity and not respect. I'm absolutely going to [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1427.56s)]
*  stand in the way of anyone who thinks it's okay for a man to be in our locker room and our changing [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1433.56s)]
*  rooms and our dressing rooms and women's bathrooms. And in fact, if you agree with that, you're crazy [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1439.0s)]
*  because that's not okay. It's not okay. Thank you, congressman. We're going to peel away from [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1443.8s)]
*  this conversation, Kira. So a little bit of the context of what we were just talking about, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1448.44s)]
*  and I'm going to have my cameraman step out of the active driveway here, was that Nancy Mays put [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1452.3600000000001s)]
*  forward this piece of legislation. It was aimed, she said, although the name is not in the legislation, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1457.0s)]
*  at a new member of Congress, Sarah McBride of Delaware, who is a transgender woman. She has [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1461.3200000000002s)]
*  said that the legislation would prevent women from using male restrooms and vice versa in the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1465.72s)]
*  United States Capitol. Speaker Johnson has said he made a statement earlier today where he said he [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1471.16s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. They already are doing it. God, the people obsessed with the silver. So off the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1476.84s)]
*  deep end, this is how ridiculous Gunther is. Here's part of the proof that Michelle is a man and also [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1480.68s)]
*  Nancy Mays. Honestly, I believe Nancy Mays is slash was a man. Anyone can get breast implants [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1486.92s)]
*  and grow their hair long to look like a woman. She's visually not a real woman at GOP at house [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1492.04s)]
*  GOP at Senate GOP at SCOTUS block at us Supreme court at Trump truth post at governor Rhonda [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1497.32s)]
*  Santas at Ross on Iran is and is at Nancy Mays at FBI at CIA at ATF. I personally think Nancy Mays [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1503.48s)]
*  is a man. She looks manly and she's full of shit about FEMA. She should ask Trump about FEMA, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1511.0s)]
*  how he stole the money from FEMA and for the military. Nancy Mays is a man. No idea why people [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1517.0s)]
*  think she he's hot. Nancy may saying anyone is disrespectful to women. When is a rape victim [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1521.24s)]
*  sporting a man found liable for sexual assault is crazy as hell. A rape victim turning into a rape [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1527.4s)]
*  Apologies. What? Wait, nevermind. This is just someone saying normal things. I'm convinced Nancy [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1531.88s)]
*  Mays is a man. Nancy Mays is secretly a man breaking representative. Nancy Mays introduces [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1537.96s)]
*  measure to ban men from women's bathrooms on Capitol Hill. Sarah McBride, who is the first [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1543.3200000000002s)]
*  trans member of Congress blasted the attempt as far right extremism. Dumb question, but which is [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1547.64s)]
*  which I honestly don't know which one is the real woman. They both look like men. Oh, this bill is [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1552.1200000000001s)]
*  objectively targeting a single person. So I don't know how they can look into a camera and say it [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1558.92s)]
*  doesn't. It affects a single person. How can they say it isn't targeting? I mean, it is. It absolutely [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1562.3600000000001s)]
*  is. What is this Trump supporters? The outriders arguing with Democrats. The fuck is this? The [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1568.04s)]
*  shocking Maga couple footage. I almost couldn't post it. Hi. I had the tag. Which of them was [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1573.72s)]
*  Nancy Mays in case her drooling fans started harassing the wrong woman for being trans. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1578.1200000000001s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1583.48s)]
*  Although Nancy mays is under the impression that her resolution or something of the like will now [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1613.48s)]
*  go into the new house of representatives rules package, which would theoretically be voted on [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1618.28s)]
*  and approved by the next Congress come January. And just trying to look back at Trump's ads as he [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1622.92s)]
*  was running for president. I'm damn it almost feels like the trans women in sports was, you know, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1630.68s)]
*  just a way to feed into the transphobia, trans panic narratives and the hysteria exhibited by [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1636.68s)]
*  many Americans and addressing this as though it's a serious concern that people have was just silly [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1643.4s)]
*  and that we should have just brushed aside these conversations by immediately being like, why the [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1650.28s)]
*  fuck do you care about this? You're a goddamn weirdo. Your pathological obsession with trans [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1655.3200000000002s)]
*  people is obsessive. And I do not care to have this discussion with you. Perhaps that could have [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1660.04s)]
*  been a much more successful way to deal with this subject matter. But no, what the fuck do I know? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1666.36s)]
*  I mean, he's probably going to be right along with Nancy Mays if she pushes for this. She won't, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1673.8s)]
*  she won't get any pushback from the president elect, right? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1679.24s)]
*  It's very much unclear. We know that president elect Trump made targeting [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1683.9599999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris's position on transgender issues, a key point of his campaign. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1688.12s)]
*  And we also know that he's given speaker Mike Johnson, the president elect has [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1692.6799999999998s)]
*  roped to essentially run the House of Representatives, how he sees fit. So it's [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1696.4399999999998s)]
*  really up to Mike Johnson at this hour. And it's really hard to parse what Mike Johnson wants to do. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1701.32s)]
*  Again, he made that statement just moments ago before cameras. He made a point actually to call [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1705.9599999999998s)]
*  cameras for this impromptu public statement where he walked out to cameras in a way that was unplanned, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1710.76s)]
*  said he believes a man is a man and a woman is a woman. I'm quoting him here. And then went on to [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1716.6s)]
*  say that he believes that each member of the House, each new member, and every member in general [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1720.44s)]
*  should be afforded dignity and respect. So we don't quite know where he lands on this. But [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1725.3200000000002s)]
*  Nancy Mays has said that he promised her that her opinion on this and her position on this and her [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1729.3200000000002s)]
*  resolution, which you just heard her outline there speaking to me, will be included in this new rules [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1733.96s)]
*  package put forward by the House of Representatives come January. But Kristen Soltis Anderson, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1738.92s)]
*  trans issues became such a flash point in this election, in no small part because of that one [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1744.28s)]
*  ad that the Trump team, what the fuck is up with my, why are the subtitles like this? What he put [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1749.88s)]
*  a lot of money behind that really broke through the flip side of, you know, talking about this is [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1755.0800000000002s)]
*  that usually these measures impact where, how do I fix that? It says background color black is just [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1761.24s)]
*  not showing it for people, whether it's transgender women and transgender girls in women's sports, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1767.3200000000002s)]
*  or a situation like this, where there is one in no small part because of that one ad, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1774.0400000000002s)]
*  Nope, chat, shut the fuck up. Font color is fine. It's just weird. And it's busted. Look, font color [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1778.12s)]
*  white font size 100% background color black. It's normal. Opacity is 75%. That's also normal. Here, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1784.36s)]
*  let's make it 100%. It's not changing anything. Member of Congress. Y'all are dumb. Oh, wait, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1791.3999999999999s)]
*  why did that happen? Why did that happen? Chris, who is clearly being targeted by this bill, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1796.92s)]
*  clearly Nancy Mase is going to get some attention for doing this. When you look at this back and [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1808.36s)]
*  forth, how do you see this cutting? Well, first, I think it's important to unpack why that ad was [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1814.44s)]
*  one that Republicans ran so often and ultimately felt was a successful ad in the campaign. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1819.8s)]
*  And I think it comes down to the very end of the ad where it sets up this dynamic of Democrats are [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1824.76s)]
*  for this small group that you're not a part of. Donald Trump's for you. And so when the debate is [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1830.76s)]
*  what should be prioritized, should you be prioritized? I mean, that's an argument that [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1837.48s)]
*  Republicans found worked with a lot of voters. It is also true that over the last, say, six, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1842.04s)]
*  seven years, we have seen public opinion shift in a pretty significant way against considering [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1848.04s)]
*  gender identity ahead of biological sex. I mean, particularly among Republicans, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1854.76s)]
*  it's something like nine out of 10 believe that biological sex should be considered first. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1858.6s)]
*  So that's part of why Nancy Mase is doing this. Note, she's run a foul of Republicans in the past [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1862.6s)]
*  for anti-Trump stances. She's had quite a journey on that front. And so it wouldn't surprise me if [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1867.16s)]
*  this isn't part of saying like, look at me, I'm a true conservative. I'm taking this action. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1871.88s)]
*  Let's watch the piece of the ad that you were just kind of running through that [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1877.0s)]
*  sets up this debate or did for the presidential election. Watch. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1880.2s)]
*  It's hard to believe, but it's true. Even the liberal media was shocked. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1883.0s)]
*  Kamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1886.8400000000001s)]
*  Every transgender in. Dude, why? I can't believe there's like [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1891.8000000000002s)]
*  playing this again and again and again. I feel like they want it to be a successful ad because [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  it corresponds to their own personal biases, right? Why are they not talking of trans males? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1902.12s)]
*  They don't care about that. They just denied the existence of trans men to begin with. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1908.28s)]
*  And me would have access. Kamala's for they, them. President Trump is for you. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1913.08s)]
*  That last line, Lonnie really seemed to kind of cut through. And to Kristen's point, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1918.4399999999998s)]
*  they kept saying it was effective, but it was only effective in places where house members [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1925.6399999999999s)]
*  weren't counter messaging. Sherrod Brown and ramp Tammy Baldwin did anti-trans as the counter [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1928.36s)]
*  message ads saying they were radically pro trans. Like it's not radical. It's not radical to be this [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1932.52s)]
*  way. I mean, Andy Bashar is the perfect fucking counter to this. Okay. The most popular governor [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1938.84s)]
*  in the entire fucking nation in a plus 35 red state. And he is pro trans unconditionally. He's [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1944.12s)]
*  vetoed anti-trans bills over and over again. He does not give a shit. He's uncompromising on it. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1951.8s)]
*  And he has a fantastic answer to this where he's like, Nope, those are God's, those are God's [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1957.6399999999999s)]
*  children. Those are our fucking neighbors. Those are my constituents. I have no, I will always [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1963.08s)]
*  welcome them into the state Capitol and I will always take photos with them. I don't give a fuck. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1967.8799999999999s)]
*  Fuck you. You should be ashamed of yourself. You should apologize for singling out these people. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1974.52s)]
*  Okay. That's it. How the fuck does he get away with it? It almost feels like if you just stand [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1978.92s)]
*  10 toes down and say, no, y'all are being fucking weird. Those are just like normal ass people. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1983.24s)]
*  Fuck you. Yeah. Here sports bill first, you will not find one example, not one of a competitive [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1988.1200000000001s)]
*  advantage by transgender athlete in Kentucky. You will not find one. The reason is KH SAA was ahead [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=1996.6000000000001s)]
*  of its time and it's already implemented very stringent standards and rules that prevent it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2003.72s)]
*  I mean, the rules actually say they prevent it. They say that an athlete either has to transition [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2010.1200000000001s)]
*  before they reach puberty where you don't have in that hormonal potential advantage, or you have to [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2015.64s)]
*  go through a hormonal therapy for enough time to where there is not a competitive advantage. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2021.96s)]
*  It's directly written in. So KH SAA has already very strictly prevented the thing that people are [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2028.04s)]
*  trying to get other folks riled up about. There cannot be an athlete with an uncompetitive advantage [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2036.52s)]
*  in Kentucky under the current rules. So what then does this do? I worry that it makes kids that are [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2043.08s)]
*  already struggling feel worse about themselves. Listen, I remember middle school. Middle school [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2050.28s)]
*  was hard. Kids in middle school. It's hard on them. Now imagine middle school with social media. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2055.24s)]
*  Now imagine middle school being a child who is trans, who's probably either not on a sports team [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2061.0s)]
*  or certainly not playing it for anything other than meeting other kids and trying to be just accepted [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2067.3999999999996s)]
*  as a human being. That's I love sports. I love watching them, but my faith calls me to put [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2073.08s)]
*  compassion and care for my fellow human being above anything else. And I think about one of [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2079.56s)]
*  my favorite stories in the Bible where, you know, at the time people would keep kids away from [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2085.72s)]
*  major religious leaders or government figures, right? And Jesus turns to his apostles and he [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2090.84s)]
*  says, let the kids come to me and do not hinder them. He didn't read in any exceptions, none. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2096.68s)]
*  And this is something that governors of Indiana and Utah have done. So anybody claiming that [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2102.04s)]
*  somebody's being driven by any woke this or that. Well, first of all, I read that to my wife and [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2108.52s)]
*  she laughed out loud and said, do they know you still try to wear a suit you bought 20 years ago? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2113.0s)]
*  And and we're just trying to do the right thing. I think people by now through everything we've [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2117.56s)]
*  been through through everything we've said at this podium knows that I'm not driven by any base. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2122.84s)]
*  I'm driven by what I believe is right. And here I'm trying to put what I believe is a calling to [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2127.88s)]
*  always come at things with the greatest of care and compassion for individuals, especially [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2134.36s)]
*  our youth first. Yeah. So, I mean, he's not the most charismatic guy, obviously, but like, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2140.6s)]
*  it don't matter. Obviously, obviously, regardless, regardless. I mean, there is a method out there. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2147.4s)]
*  There's a way to do this. Tim Walz has done it as well. This is what the average South American [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2155.7999999999997s)]
*  Christian thinks they sound like when they spit vile shit out. Yeah. Opinion on the farmers [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2160.2s)]
*  protest in the UK. I don't know. But anytime I hear about a farmer's protest, I'm immediately [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2165.24s)]
*  inclined to assume it's reactionary. Sorry. Don't get mad at me for saying that. But when I hear [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2170.4399999999996s)]
*  truckers protests or farmers protests, I think, oh, except for India, except for India in India, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2175.64s)]
*  it's good. I'm just setting up my camera and stuff. It's not ready yet, but I'm just setting [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2181.72s)]
*  this stuff up to get it ready. Just ADHD things. No, no. I'm getting it ready for Dr. Mike. I'm [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2187.48s)]
*  getting my body ready to, I'm so fucked. We're going to watch the Theo von clip from the docket. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2196.92s)]
*  Don't worry. Boy, boy finally talks about Hassan versus Ethan Klein and Twitch demonetization. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2202.2s)]
*  Watch a clip of Trudeau blaming the labor shortage in your vassal state. I did, I did talk about the, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2209.2400000000002s)]
*  are you going to go to a gym? Is it coming to your house? No, we're going to go to a gym. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2215.48s)]
*  We're going to go to my gym. Why am I fucked? Because Dr. Mike is crazy. I mean, he is a, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2218.92s)]
*  he is a hardcore. He's Mr. Push till failure. He's Mr. He's in the, he's the Mr. Science based lifter [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2224.84s)]
*  who was also scientifically modified. I'm more of a Jeff nippered kind of guy. He is a maniac. You [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2233.4s)]
*  are going to be raglamout. I know he's going to leave you crying for more. Yeah. And I already did [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2240.12s)]
*  legs. I already did legs yesterday. And yes, I am familiar that Dr. Oz is now in H he's, he's in [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2245.3199999999997s)]
*  charge of Medicare and Medicaid, which I'm excited about. I said, finally some Turkish DEI, but [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2254.68s)]
*  anyway, that's the anti-trans bill. And it feels like they're using that as another opportunity [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2260.52s)]
*  to be super transphobic. And it almost feels like there's nothing going on. It almost feels like [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2267.0s)]
*  this has nothing to do with the fairness in sports at all. Oh my God, I'm shocked and everything to [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2273.16s)]
*  do with just being transphobic. Oh my God. I'm shocked. Sarah McBride, young man or a woman. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2278.2000000000003s)]
*  Look, I'm not going to get into this. We welcome all new members with open arms who are duly [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2287.88s)]
*  elected representatives of the people. I believe it's a, it's a command that we treat all persons [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2294.28s)]
*  with dignity and respect and we will, and I'm not going to engage in silly debates about this. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2299.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a concern about the uses of restroom facilities and locker rooms and all that. This [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2305.4s)]
*  is an issue that Congress has never had to address before. And we're going to do that in deliberate [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2309.4s)]
*  fashion with member consensus on it. And we will accommodate the needs of every single person. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2314.84s)]
*  That's all I'm going to say about that. Do you plan on bringing a Nancy Mase's transgender bill [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2320.36s)]
*  and putting that into the rules package? We're not, I'm not going to address the plans on any [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2325.56s)]
*  of that. I just told you what I'm going to say about the issue. I'm not going to engage in this. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2329.96s)]
*  We don't look down upon anyone. We treat everybody with dignity and respect. That's a principle that [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2332.92s)]
*  I've pursued my whole life and we will take care of this, you know, issue of first impression for [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2337.08s)]
*  Congress as we will any other thing. We'll, we'll provide appropriate accommodation for every member [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2341.6400000000003s)]
*  of Congress. This can happen here. The ADL reacts to anti-Semitic attacks in Amsterdam. Oh my God. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2346.6s)]
*  They are. Oh, and then they, the MAGA backlash came in hot and Mike Johnson had to clarify his [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2354.44s)]
*  statement. Hello everybody. I just want to make a statement for all of you here and be very clear. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2361.96s)]
*  I was asked a question this morning at the leadership gaggle and I rejected the premise [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2367.4s)]
*  because the answer is, is so obvious for anybody who doesn't know my well-established record on, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2371.24s)]
*  on this issue. He's like, I'm, I have a long standing record of being transphobic. Okay. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2376.36s)]
*  I, Michael Penis have always been transphobic. I just didn't even think that you guys would bring [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2382.36s)]
*  it up to me. This is utterly ridiculous. So let me make it clear. Be unequivocally clear. A man is a [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2388.36s)]
*  man and a woman is a woman and a man cannot become a woman. That said, I also believe that's what [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2397.2400000000002s)]
*  scripture teaches what I just said. But I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2404.44s)]
*  And so we can do and believe all those things at the same time. And I wanted to make that clear [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2409.7200000000003s)]
*  for everybody because there's lots of questions, but that's where I stand. I've stood there my [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2414.92s)]
*  whole life and those are facts. Hello everybody. Thank God. Thank God. He clarified. I was really [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2417.96s)]
*  worried that he wasn't sufficiently bigoted. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YNoMpmdrk&t=2423.32s)]
