# Mamdani Campaign Celebrates Victory | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY)
*  He's a good dude. He's a good dude. Brad is a good dude, bro. See? Look how much praise he's getting. Look how much praise he's getting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=0.0s)]
*  A ton of Jewish New Yorkers went out and voted for him. He won. What are you saying? Zanny Jardin? Oh my god, Zanny Jardin is in the comments. Wait, Zanny Jardin is also like one of these ultra Zionist weirdos. I mean, that makes sense. It tracks. Remember, homie, what set you from that Zanny Jardin? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=16.44s)]
*  Who's real name is like very funny. It's not like a cool name at all. All right. Let's see what Fox has to say. I assume they have some good words, right? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=43.0s)]
*  Trump in Amsterdam for a high stakes NATO summit, fresh off a wild. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=53.76s)]
*  Wait, this is, this is from, this is a replay of the earlier. This is a replay from the earlier Fox five. Do you see this post about Zora? I'm posing by saving a Yiddish bookstore in 2020. Okay. Here's another thing I have to explain to you guys. Okay. For those of you who don't know. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=58.0s)]
*  Preserving Yiddish institutions is, I wouldn't say controversial, but like for ultra Zionist preserving Yiddish institutions is seen as like an attack. Zoran had Zoran also had on his campaign, some Yiddish posters as well, which was very cool. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=73.0s)]
*  But a lot of, a lot of Zionists hate Yiddish. It's more of a, it's more of a complex relationship than you would think because the restoration of, of Hebrew going from a liturgical language to a commonplace language is a very important part of the design is project. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=93.16s)]
*  And some will say Yiddish is like the language of, of oppression. But I think for the most part, it's just because like they want to hype up. They want to hype up a Hebrew. So him doing this, him doing this will not be treated as like, Oh, he's pro Jew by the groups that are already calling him anti-Semitic. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=112.72s)]
*  As a matter of fact, they probably see this as a more angering, like they probably look at this as a attack. Of course, it's not an anti-Semitic thing to do. He's not anti-Semitic. Obviously. But my point is, you know, people, people don't like, if you think that this would make groups that would call Zoran anti-Semitic feel more comfortable. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=137.24s)]
*  Remember, it's not real anti-Semitism. They're not worried about actually him being anti-Semitic. It depends. I think most Israel supporting Jews, at least in America or of European descent have some connection to Yiddish and don't view it quite like that. Yeah, I'm talking about the people who are like, people who, who, you know, people who are like ultra Zionist. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=159.88s)]
*  We have so many leaders here tonight, but I want to recognize our very first endorsers, those who believed in us before New York knew Zoran's name. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=189.88s)]
*  So let's hear a round of applause for New York City, TSA. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=206.92s)]
*  They're going crazy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=214.28s)]
*  No, no, you don't understand. It's a preemptive accusation of antisemitism. Zoran is days away from developing antisemitism of mass destruction. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=215.2s)]
*  Drum beats, drum beats. New York communities for change. Jewish voice for peace action. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=227.64s)]
*  Damn, they're breaking the audio. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  And let us hear it for the New York working families party. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  We also have here our trusted advisors, our loved ones, our elected partners, our volunteers and our absolutely amazing staff. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=258.64s)]
*  What is DSA? Democratic Socialists of America chatter. What the, how do you not know what DSA is? Are you joking? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=278.36s)]
*  Oh, you asshole. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=284.04s)]
*  Six month subscriber. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=288.24s)]
*  I'm still. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=301.48s)]
*  Ours has been a campaign of trust, of joy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=302.12s)]
*  I'm still in a, I'm still not fully there yet. It doesn't feel. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=305.36s)]
*  I don't think we should feel comfortable. I don't want to be a naysayer, but we shouldn't be comfortable until the general. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=312.4s)]
*  And we articulated the vision for the movement that we hoped to build. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=316.68s)]
*  Each day we would work to embody the values of a better world. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=321.56s)]
*  We would campaign, legislate and organize in a way to make these values true by our actions. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=327.12s)]
*  We would resist the creeping fascist tide through trust and we would build trust by acting trustingly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=336.44s)]
*  And it has been the same with this campaign. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  We have already realized an image of the city we want and we deserve. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=348.2s)]
*  Together we have built and strengthened our shared bonds, bonds of struggle, bonds of friendship, bonds between families, neighbors and tenants. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=357.96s)]
*  This campaign has never been about the achievement of a singular end goal. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=367.96s)]
*  It's not just about the struggle for solidarity. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=377.68s)]
*  It's about the solidarity in the struggle. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=380.76s)]
*  All this coming together of tens of thousands of strangers to support one another and fight for our shared values. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  This movement in itself is a force and this movement is a victory over alienation and cynicism. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=396.24s)]
*  So please look around you and don't forget these are our people. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=406.24s)]
*  You are not alone and you are not powerless. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  I am so proud of all that we are. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=418.52s)]
*  And now it is my honor to introduce one of Zaraan's first supporters both in the race for mayor and when first elected to the assembly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=420.84s)]
*  Our congresswoman, working class champion and incredible partner of our campaign, Congresswoman Nidia Velasquez. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=430.84s)]
*  Well the audio is not better on this one either. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=439.84s)]
*  We want to hear from Zaraan. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=450.84s)]
*  So thank you so much. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=458.84s)]
*  I am just so proud of all of you for the work that you put together to get to this moment. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=460.84s)]
*  And to work so hard for the city that we all love. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  So let me just say hello Long Island City. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  What a night. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  Aren't you glad you stayed home and read us the news and tweets posted in the chat that we could have just read and watched ourselves? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes I am. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=500.24s)]
*  It's worth it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=502.24s)]
*  Stop saying Alhassan. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=508.24s)]
*  Don't make me put the hat back on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=511.24s)]
*  Don't make me put the Fauci hat back on. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=522.24s)]
*  The Cuomo Fauci. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=525.24s)]
*  The Cuomo Fauci. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=530.24s)]
*  Lauren Mandani brought people from every background together around a simple powerful idea. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=535.24s)]
*  That New York City should be a city for everyone. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=547.24s)]
*  Not just the wealthy. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=552.44s)]
*  Not just the well connected. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=555.44s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=558.44s)]
*  He spoke to the struggles we all see. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=561.44s)]
*  Rising rents, humbling public services, working families barely hanging on. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=566.44s)]
*  And he gave us something real to believe in. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=575.44s)]
*  Something real to believe in. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=579.6400000000001s)]
*  Hocho, Kathy Hocho made a statement. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=584.6400000000001s)]
*  Today voters made their voices heard demanding a more affordable more livable New York City. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=587.6400000000001s)]
*  I hear them loud and clear. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=591.6400000000001s)]
*  Zoram Mandani built a formidable grassroots coalition and I look forward to speaking with him in the days ahead about his ideas on how to ensure a safe, affordable and livable New York City. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=593.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, you know she was not happy to post that tweet. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=600.6400000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=603.6400000000001s)]
*  Yo, I hope Ethan Klein is doing alright by the way because he was really worried about the negative attention that I was bringing over to the Zoran campaign. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=605.84s)]
*  You know, I'm sure he'll be rest. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=613.84s)]
*  Rest assured Ethan Zoran won in spite of my support for him. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=615.84s)]
*  Idiot. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=621.84s)]
*  He supports Zoran. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=627.84s)]
*  No, he doesn't. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=628.84s)]
*  He just out of nowhere decided to attack Zoran and me as an attack against me. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=629.84s)]
*  The other day. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=635.84s)]
*  The other day. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=637.84s)]
*  Into a movement that takes us all the way to city hall. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=639.84s)]
*  And together, together we are going to elect Zoran as the next mayor of New York. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=649.84s)]
*  And change our city forever. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=662.84s)]
*  But this is the thing. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=665.84s)]
*  The city has changed. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=669.84s)]
*  Zoran, Zoran knew it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=674.84s)]
*  Other candidates didn't see it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=677.84s)]
*  And that is why we are here celebrating this incredible moment. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=680.84s)]
*  God bless you all. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=686.84s)]
*  Nia, Nia, Nia, Nia, Nia, Nia, Nia. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=695.84s)]
*  So, my name is Tish James. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=710.84s)]
*  That was crazy that she actually did like a last second endorsement too. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=716.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=722.84s)]
*  Didn't she pop off like... [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=724.0400000000001s)]
*  Didn't she do like a literal last hour endorsement? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  Like I think it was like yesterday or something. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=733.0400000000001s)]
*  Explain this. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=746.0400000000001s)]
*  The bias of low expectations. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=754.0400000000001s)]
*  And Zoran, all throughout this campaign, rejected all of that as well. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=760.0400000000001s)]
*  He kept focused on his message. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=768.0400000000001s)]
*  He wasn't concerned about the money. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  It was all about the power of the message, the power of his word. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  And so, I saw in my beloved Brooklyn and all throughout this city that this kid... [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=778.24s)]
*  A ton of Jewish New Yorkers went out and voted for him. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=788.24s)]
*  He won. What are you saying? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=792.24s)]
*  Zeni Jardin? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=795.24s)]
*  Oh my God, Zeni Jardin is in the comments. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=796.24s)]
*  Wait, Zeni Jardin is also like one of these ultra Zionist weirdos? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=799.24s)]
*  I mean that makes sense. It tracks. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=803.24s)]
*  Remember, homie, what set you from? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=805.44s)]
*  That Zeni Jardin? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=807.44s)]
*  Whose real name is like very funny. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=810.44s)]
*  He's not like a cool name at all. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=813.44s)]
*  All right, let's see what Fox has to say. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=816.44s)]
*  I assume they have some good words, right? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=818.44s)]
*  Wait, this is from... [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=824.44s)]
*  This is a replay of the earlier... [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=826.44s)]
*  This is a replay from the earlier Fox 5. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=828.44s)]
*  Do you see this post about Zoran posting about saving a Yiddish bookstore in 2020? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=830.44s)]
*  Okay, here's another thing I have to explain to you guys. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=834.6400000000001s)]
*  Okay, for those of you who don't know, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=837.6400000000001s)]
*  preserving Yiddish institutions is... [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=841.6400000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say controversial, but like for ultra Zionists, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=846.6400000000001s)]
*  preserving Yiddish institutions is seen as like an attack. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=850.6400000000001s)]
*  Zoran had... [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=853.6400000000001s)]
*  Zoran also had on his campaign some Yiddish posters as well, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=855.6400000000001s)]
*  which was very cool. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=858.6400000000001s)]
*  But a lot of Zionists hate Yiddish. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=859.84s)]
*  It's more of a complex relationship than you would think [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=865.84s)]
*  because the restoration of Hebrew, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=869.84s)]
*  going from a liturgical language to a commonplace language [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=872.84s)]
*  is a very important part of the Zionist project. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=876.84s)]
*  And some will say Yiddish is like the language of oppression. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=878.84s)]
*  But I think for the most part, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=885.84s)]
*  it's just because like they want to hype up... [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=888.0400000000001s)]
*  They want to hype up Hebrew. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  So him doing this, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=894.0400000000001s)]
*  him doing this will not be treated as like, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=896.0400000000001s)]
*  oh, he's pro-Jew by the groups that are already calling him anti-Semitic. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=898.0400000000001s)]
*  As a matter of fact, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  they probably see this as a more angering, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=905.0400000000001s)]
*  like they probably look at this as an attack. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  Of course, it's not an anti-Semitic thing to do. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=910.0400000000001s)]
*  He's not anti-Semitic, obviously. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=912.0400000000001s)]
*  But my point is, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=915.0400000000001s)]
*  people don't... [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=917.24s)]
*  If you think that this would [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=919.24s)]
*  make groups that would call Zoran anti-Semitic [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=921.24s)]
*  feel more comfortable, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=925.24s)]
*  remember, it's not real anti-Semitism. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=927.24s)]
*  They're not worried about actually him being anti-Semitic. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=929.24s)]
*  It depends. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=931.24s)]
*  I think most Israel-supporting Jews, at least in America [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=933.24s)]
*  or of European descent, have some connection to Yiddish [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=935.24s)]
*  and don't view it quite like that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=937.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'm talking about the people who are like... [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=939.24s)]
*  people who are like ultra-Zionist. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=941.24s)]
*  So, let's hear a round of applause for New York City DSA! [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=971.44s)]
*  They're going crazy. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=978.44s)]
*  No, no, you don't understand. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=984.44s)]
*  It's a preemptive accusation of anti-Semitism. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=986.44s)]
*  Zoran is days away from developing anti-Semitism of mass destruction. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=988.44s)]
*  Drum beats! Drum beats! [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=996.44s)]
*  Drum beats! Drum beats! [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=998.6400000000001s)]
*  New York Communities for Change! [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1004.6400000000001s)]
*  Jewish Voice for Peace Action! [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1009.6400000000001s)]
*  Damn, they're breaking the audio. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1014.6400000000001s)]
*  And let us hear it for the New York Working Families Party! [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1016.6400000000001s)]
*  We also have here our trusted advisors, our loved ones, our elected partners, our volunteers, and our absolutely amazing staff! [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1020.84s)]
*  What is DSA? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1044.84s)]
*  Democratic Socialists of America Chatter? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1046.84s)]
*  What is DSA? Are you joking? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1049.04s)]
*  Oh, you asshole. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1051.04s)]
*  Six month subscriber. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1055.04s)]
*  I'm still... [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1068.04s)]
*  I'm still in the... [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1072.04s)]
*  I'm still not fully there yet. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1074.04s)]
*  It doesn't feel... [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1076.04s)]
*  I don't think we should feel comfortable. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1079.04s)]
*  I don't want to be a naysayer, but we shouldn't be comfortable until the general. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1081.04s)]
*  We sat together and we articulated the vision for the movement that we hoped to build. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1083.04s)]
*  Each day, we would work to embody the values of a better world. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1088.04s)]
*  We would campaign, legislate, and organize in a way to make these values true by our actions. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1093.04s)]
*  We would resist the creeping fascist tide through trust, and we would build trust by acting trustingly. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1101.24s)]
*  And it has been the same with this campaign. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1111.24s)]
*  We have already realized an image of the city we want and we deserve. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1117.24s)]
*  Together, we have built and strengthened our shared bonds. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1121.44s)]
*  Bonds of struggle, bonds of friendship, bonds between families, neighbors, and tenants. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1125.44s)]
*  This campaign has never been about the achievement of a singular end goal. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1136.44s)]
*  It's not just about the struggle for solidarity. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1140.44s)]
*  It's about the solidarity in the struggle. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1143.44s)]
*  It's about the solidarity in the struggle. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1147.64s)]
*  All this coming together of tens of thousands of strangers to support one another and fight for our shared values. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1154.64s)]
*  This movement in itself is a force and this movement is a victory over alienation and cynicism. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1162.64s)]
*  So please look around you and don't forget these are our people. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1169.8400000000001s)]
*  You are not alone and you are not powerless. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  I am so proud of all that we are doing. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1183.8400000000001s)]
*  And now it is my honor to introduce one of Zeronga's first supporters, both in the race for mayor and when first elected to the Assembly. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1186.8400000000001s)]
*  Our Congresswoman, working class champion and incredible partner of our campaign, Congresswoman Nidia Velasquez. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1197.04s)]
*  We want to hear from Soren So. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1222.04s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1226.24s)]
*  I am just so proud of all of you for the work that you put together to get to this moment. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1228.24s)]
*  And to work so hard for the city that we all love. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1238.24s)]
*  So let me just say hello Long Island City! [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1248.24s)]
*  What a night! [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1256.24s)]
*  Aren't you glad you stayed home and read us the news and tweets posted in the chat that we could have just read and watched ourselves? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1262.24s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1267.24s)]
*  It's worth it. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1269.24s)]
*  Stop saying Al Hassan. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1275.24s)]
*  Don't make me put the hat back on. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1277.24s)]
*  You believe in this movement when the pundit said it couldn't be done. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1279.24s)]
*  You knock on doors, knock on neighbors and tonight, and tonight, we made history! [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1284.44s)]
*  Zeronga Mandani brought people from every background together around a simple, powerful idea. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1301.44s)]
*  That New York City should be a city for everyone. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1312.64s)]
*  Not just the wealthy, not just the well connected. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1322.64s)]
*  Everyone! [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1327.64s)]
*  He spoke to the struggles we all see. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1331.64s)]
*  Rising rents, humbling public services, working families barely hanging on, and he gave us something real to believe in. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1335.8400000000001s)]
*  Hocho, Kathy Hocho made a statement. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  Today, voters made their voices heard, demanding a more affordable, more livable New York City. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1354.8400000000001s)]
*  I hear them loud and clear. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1358.8400000000001s)]
*  Zeronga Mandani built a formidable grassroots coalition and I look forward to speaking with him in the days ahead [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  about his ideas on how to ensure a safe, affordable, and livable New York City. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1364.04s)]
*  You know, you know she was not happy to post that tweet. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1368.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1371.04s)]
*  Yo, I hope Ethan Klein is doing alright by the way, because he was really worried about the negative attention that I was bringing over to the Zoran campaign. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1372.04s)]
*  You know, I'm sure he'll be rest assured, Ethan. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1380.04s)]
*  Zoran won in spite of my support for him. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1384.04s)]
*  Idiot. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1388.04s)]
*  We are going to knock even more doors. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1390.24s)]
*  He supports Zoran? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1394.24s)]
*  No he doesn't. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1395.24s)]
*  He just, out of nowhere, decided to attack Zoran and me as an attack against me. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1396.24s)]
*  The other day. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1404.24s)]
*  Our victory into a movement that takes us all the way to City Hall. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1405.24s)]
*  And together, together, we are going to elect Zoran as the next Mayor of New York and change our city forever. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1412.44s)]
*  But this is the thing. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1432.44s)]
*  The city has changed. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1436.44s)]
*  Zoran, Zoran knew it. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1439.64s)]
*  Other candidates didn't see it. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1444.64s)]
*  And that is why we are here celebrating this incredible moment. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1447.64s)]
*  God bless you all. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1453.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1456.64s)]
*  Nia Nia Nia Nia Nia Nia Nia [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1462.64s)]
*  So, my name is Tish James. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1475.64s)]
*  That was crazy that she actually did like a last second endorsement too. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1480.64s)]
*  Right? Didn't she pop off like... Didn't she do like a literal last hour endorsement? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1488.64s)]
*  Like I think it was like yesterday or something. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1499.8400000000001s)]
*  Just listen, all throughout my public career I have rejected the politics of fear. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1501.44s)]
*  Explain this. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1512.44s)]
*  The politics of division. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1514.44s)]
*  The politics of hate. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1516.44s)]
*  The bias of low expectations. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1519.44s)]
*  And Zoran, all throughout this campaign, rejected all of that as well. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1526.44s)]
*  He kept focused on his message. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1533.44s)]
*  He wasn't concerned about the money. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1537.44s)]
*  It was all about the power of the message, the power of his word. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1540.44s)]
*  And so I saw in my beloved Brooklyn and all throughout this city that this campaign, it was fueled by the power of people. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1546.44s)]
*  People yearning for change in this city. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1558.44s)]
*  People who heard his message. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1563.44s)]
*  And we all came together. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1566.44s)]
*  And I want those who are listening, who came to me, who called me, who text me, who emailed me, who were afraid. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1568.44s)]
*  I want all of you to know that after this campaign is over we will all come together. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1578.44s)]
*  We will heal this city. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1586.44s)]
*  And I want all of you to know that you need to understand that Zoran is really a man who respects the humanity of everyone. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1590.44s)]
*  The primary is now over. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1606.44s)]

*  And tonight we celebrate the victory. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1620.44s)]
*  Tonight represents a resounding win. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1626.44s)]
*  His critics said that he should wait his turn. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1633.44s)]
*  His critics said that he didn't have the experience. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1641.44s)]
*  His critics said that he didn't have the right name. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1646.44s)]
*  Well now all of them know his goddamn name. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1653.44s)]
*  Goddamn, they're blowing it up. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1657.44s)]
*  What's his name? What's his name? What's his name? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1673.44s)]
*  What's his name? What's his name? What's his name? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1679.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Democratic nominee for the city of New York, Zoran Mazar. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1685.44s)]

*  There we go. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1878.54s)]
*  Today, eight months after launching this campaign, with the vision of a city that every New Yorker could afford, we have won. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1883.54s)]
*  We have won from Harlem to Bay Ridge. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1904.54s)]
*  We have won from Jackson Heights to Port Richmond. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1912.54s)]
*  We have won from Maspit to Chinatown. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1916.54s)]
*  We have won because New Yorkers have stood up for a city they can afford. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1920.54s)]
*  A city where they can do more than just struggle. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1925.54s)]
*  One where those who toil in the night can enjoy the fruits of their labor in the day. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1929.54s)]
*  Where hard work is repaid with a stable life. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1935.54s)]
*  Where eight hours on the factory floor or behind the wheel of a cab is enough to pay the mortgage. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1939.54s)]
*  It is enough to keep the lights on. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1946.54s)]
*  It is enough to send your kid to school. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1949.54s)]
*  Where rent stabilized apartments are actually stabilized. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1953.54s)]
*  Where buses are fast and free. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1959.54s)]
*  Where childcare doesn't cost more than CUNY. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1964.54s)]
*  And where public safety keeps us truly safe. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1969.54s)]
*  And it's where the mayor will use their power to reject Donald Trump's fascism. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1975.54s)]
*  To stop mass ICE agents from deporting our neighbors. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1982.54s)]
*  And to govern our city as a model for the Democratic Party. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1989.54s)]
*  A party where we fight for working people with no apology. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=1997.54s)]
*  A life of dignity should not be reserved for a fortunate few. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2003.54s)]
*  It should be one that city government guarantees for each and every New Yorker. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2009.54s)]
*  If this campaign has demonstrated anything to the world, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2016.54s)]
*  it is that our dreams can be made real. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2022.54s)]
*  If this campaign has demonstrated anything to the world, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2025.54s)]
*  it is that our dreams can become reality. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2030.54s)]
*  Dreaming demands hope. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2037.54s)]
*  And when I think of hope, I think of the unprecedented coalition of New Yorkers that we have built. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2040.54s)]
*  For this, this is not my victory. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2049.54s)]
*  This is ours. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2052.54s)]
*  It is the victory of the mother of the mission, Auntie. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2055.54s)]
*  Who knocked on door after door until her feet throbbed and her knuckles ached. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2063.54s)]
*  It is the victory of the 18 year old who voted in their first ever election. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2071.54s)]
*  And it is the victory of the Gambian uncle who finally saw himself and his struggle in a dream. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2077.54s)]
*  Dreaming demands solidarity. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2090.54s)]
*  And when I look out at this room and out onto the midnight skyline, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2093.54s)]
*  that is what I see. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2099.54s)]
*  That is what I see. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2101.54s)]
*  Canvas launches that continue to be a great. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2104.54s)]
*  Children who called parents, strangers who care about those they will never meet. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2108.54s)]
*  A New York that believes in each other and in itself. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2115.54s)]
*  This is solidarity. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2120.54s)]
*  And it defines our victory. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2124.54s)]
*  And above all, dreaming demands work. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2128.54s)]
*  Last Friday night, as the sun began to drop in the sky, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2134.54s)]
*  I set off on a 13 mile walk from the northernmost tip of Manhattan to the base of the island. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2141.54s)]
*  We began in Inwood, where music played and neighbors set out dominoes on the sidewalk. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2150.54s)]
*  It was 7 p.m. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2158.54s)]
*  The weekend had arrived. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2161.54s)]
*  For most people, the time for work was over. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2164.54s)]
*  But this is New York, where the work never ends. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2168.54s)]
*  Waiters carried plates on 181st Street. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2173.54s)]
*  Conductors drove the subways that rattled high above 125th. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2177.54s)]
*  And world class musicians tuned instruments as we passed Lincoln Square. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2182.54s)]
*  By the time we made it downtown, a crowd marched behind us. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2188.54s)]
*  A living embodiment of the energy and purpose that defines this campaign. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2195.54s)]
*  Still, long past midnight, New York worked. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2201.54s)]
*  Garbage trucks weaved through empty streets. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2208.54s)]
*  Fishmongers carried in tomorrow's wares. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2212.54s)]
*  And when we finally arrived at the Battery at 2 20 a.m. in the morning, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2215.54s)]
*  the workers who run the Staten Island Ferry were on the job too. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2221.54s)]
*  Just as they are every hour of the day, every day of the week. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2226.54s)]
*  Each of these New Yorkers carried a dream with them that night as they labored. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2232.54s)]
*  Just as each of us dreams of a New York that is more hopeful and affordable for all. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2240.54s)]
*  And we have worked hard for our dream. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2247.54s)]
*  This has been a historically contentious race. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2251.54s)]
*  One that has filled our airwaves with millions in smears and slander. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2256.54s)]
*  I hope now that this primary has come to an end. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2263.54s)]
*  I can introduce myself once more. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2270.54s)]
*  Not as you've seen me in a 30 second ad or in a mail you're in your mailbox. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2277.54s)]
*  But as how I will lead as your mayor. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2283.54s)]
*  I will be the mayor for every New Yorker. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2291.54s)]
*  Whether you voted for me, for Governor Cuomo, or felt too disillusioned by a long broken political system to vote at all. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2296.54s)]
*  I will fight for a city that works for you. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2308.54s)]
*  That is affordable for you. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2311.54s)]
*  That is safe for you. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2314.54s)]
*  I will work to be a mayor you will be proud to call your own. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2317.54s)]
*  I cannot promise that you will always agree with me. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2327.54s)]
*  But I will never hide from you. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2332.54s)]
*  But I will never hide from you. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2334.54s)]
*  If you are hurting, I will try to heal. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2338.54s)]
*  If you feel misunderstood, I will strive to understand. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2342.54s)]
*  Your concerns will always be mine. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2347.54s)]
*  And I will put your hopes before my own. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2351.54s)]
*  And I know that those hopes extend beyond our five boroughs. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2355.54s)]
*  There are millions of New Yorkers who have strong feelings about what happens overseas. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2360.54s)]
*  I am one of them. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2367.54s)]
*  And while I will not abandon my beliefs or my commitments, grounded in a demand for equality, for humanity, for all those who walk this earth. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2371.54s)]
*  You have my word to reach further, to understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree, and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2385.54s)]
*  Let me close with this. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2401.54s)]
*  In these dark times, I know that it is harder than ever to keep faith in our democracy. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2404.54s)]
*  It has been attacked by billionaires and their big spending, by elected officials who care more about self-enrichment than the public trust, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2413.54s)]
*  and by authoritarian leaders who rule through fear. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2423.54s)]
*  But above all, our democracy has been attacked from within. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2428.54s)]
*  For too long, New Yorkers have strained to find a leader who represents us, who puts us first. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2434.54s)]
*  And we have been betrayed time and again. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2443.54s)]
*  After so many disappointments, the heart hardens. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2447.54s)]
*  Belief becomes elusive. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2452.54s)]
*  And when we no longer believe in our democracy, it only becomes easier for people like Donald Trump to convince us of his worth. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2455.54s)]
*  For billionaires to convince us that they must always lead. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2466.54s)]
*  As FDR said, democracy has disappeared in several other great nations. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2472.54s)]
*  Not because the people dislike democracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment, of seeing their children hungry, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2479.54s)]
*  while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and weakness. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2491.54s)]
*  In desperation, they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2497.54s)]
*  New York, if we have made one thing clear over these past months, it is that we need not choose between the two. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2504.54s)]
*  We can be free, and we can be fed. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2516.54s)]
*  We can demand what we deserve. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2523.54s)]
*  And together we have built a movement where everyday New Yorkers recognize themselves in our vision of democracy. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2528.54s)]
*  Every new voter registered, that is faith renewed. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2539.54s)]
*  Every voter who traveled through withering heat to the polls, that is faith renewed. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2545.54s)]
*  And every New Yorker who sees solutions to the daily challenges they face in this campaign, that is faith renewed. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2552.54s)]
*  Together New York, we have renewed our democracy. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2563.54s)]
*  We have given our city permission to believe again. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2568.54s)]
*  And I pledge to you that we will remake this great city, not in my image, but in the image of every New Yorker who has only known struggle. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2573.54s)]
*  In our New York, the power belongs to the people. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2585.54s)]
*  No way! It's the other account, I suspect. It's got to be the other account. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2590.54s)]
*  The people that are here with me today. And as I thank the incredible leaders who have long fought for those people, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2596.54s)]
*  who are here across this crowd and across these five boroughs and standing next to me in the Attorney General of this state. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2607.54s)]
*  In the public advocate of this city. In our Congresswoman, Nidia Velasquez. In our Comptroller, Brad Lander. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2614.54s)]
*  And in every single person who believed in this campaign long before it was easy to do so. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2628.54s)]
*  And you believed when it was difficult. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2637.54s)]
*  We dreamt in the night and we are now building in the dawn. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2644.54s)]
*  That new day, the one that we have yearned for, the one that we have struggled for, the one that we have knocked for, have texted for, have called for. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2651.54s)]
*  The one that we have obsessed over. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2662.54s)]
*  That new day is finally here, my friends. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2669.54s)]
*  And it is here because you have delivered it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2677.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2683.54s)]
*  Manzani! Manzani! Manzani! Manzani! Manzani! Manzani! Manzani! [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2692.54s)]
*  Wow. Like I said, it still doesn't feel real. But also on top of that, it not only doesn't feel real, but it also feels like there's so much more work to be done. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2708.54s)]
*  And I'm still so worried about the fucking general. You know, our work is not done, chat. You must remain vigilant. It's good. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2718.54s)]
*  And as I thank you, I must thank those who brought me into this world. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2730.54s)]
*  But we must remain vigilant. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2738.54s)]
*  I must thank my mother and my father. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2740.54s)]
*  Mira and Mahmood. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2752.54s)]
*  And I must thank... [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2758.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. Four years ago, he was just a part of a Gravel Institute video. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2770.54s)]
*  And I must thank my incredible wife. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2776.54s)]
*  Talking about Austrian-style socialist housing. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2778.54s)]
*  Rama Doozhi. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2783.54s)]
*  This is Mahmood Mamdani's book, The CIA and the Factory of Islamist Terrorism. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2792.54s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you so much. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2800.54s)]
*  Now let us lead this city into one that is affordable for each and every New Yorker. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2819.54s)]
*  Dude, what a fucking... What a night. What a night. What a night. What a night. Oh my God. I cannot wait to fucking watch everyone coping and seething. Oh my God. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2830.54s)]
*  There's still so much work to be done, like I said. So much fucking work to be done. How far you came? Yeah, look, look, look. This is fucking four years ago. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2854.54s)]
*  Look at us. Look at us. This is before... This is before I knew who the fuck Zoram Mamdani even was, really. I just thought he was just some random guy on a Gravel video. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2869.54s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2884.54s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2886.54s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2888.54s)]
*  Whatever happened at Gravel Institute? Well, my Gravel died, rest in peace. And then half of the fucking dudes that were on there became like total fucking weirdos. I don't know what happened to the other half, but you've been a Mamdani fan. Okay. To be fair, I didn't know anything about him here. I can't take credit for that. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2910.54s)]
*  But this was more so me just watching a Gravel Institute video. But yeah, this was crazy. I do. I do wonder, like, I mean, I think the policies are huge. They're obviously important. His charisma is obviously important, but I do kind of think like, do the podcasters have motion? Like, do we have motion chat? No memes. Like Chapo, myself, majority report. Like there were a lot of, I don't know, I don't know. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2931.54s)]
*  There were a lot of early boosters on the, on the left wing podcast target. Like, do we have some motion? I don't know. Maybe because like I didn't really, I didn't really think about it like this before. It was a Nick Mullin endorsement. Okay. I'm being serious. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nuvBGJhyiY&t=2961.54s)]
