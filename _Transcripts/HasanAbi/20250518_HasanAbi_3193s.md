# Biden Has CANCER | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw)
*  would come on Friday and it with the use of aggressive form of prostate cancer hormone sensitive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=0.0s)]
*  but I can't wait for the liberals to talk about how uh up the left is for saying they don't care [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=7.76s)]
*  myself included that we don't care that Biden has a prostate cancer [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  oh my god everyone is coming in here to post this I know chatters I know here let's get the CNN [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=18.96s)]
*  minutes ago we received a statement from the personal office of former president Joe Biden [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=31.28s)]
*  announcing that Biden had been diagnosed on Friday as an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=36.56s)]
*  spread to his bones I want to read you that full statement it says last week president Joe Biden [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=48.8s)]
*  on Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer characterized by a Gleason score of nine with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  metastasis to the bone while this represents a more aggressive form of the disease the cancer [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  appears to be hormone sensitive which allows for effective management statement goes on to say that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=64.32s)]
*  Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his positions of course former [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=69.52s)]
*  president Biden is 82 years old and there was so much scrutiny around his mental acuity and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=74.56s)]
*  physical fitness to serve a second term back in July of 2024 during the presidential campaign of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=80.8s)]
*  course the former president ultimately dropping out of the race after that debate and of course [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=86.56s)]
*  all of that is the subject of a brand new book from our colleague Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=92.4s)]
*  out this month that is really generating a lot of headlines as well as the release of audio tapes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=97.68s)]
*  from former special for the former special counsel Robert Herr audio of the president [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=103.76s)]
*  struggling to recount certain dates and names but of course this is a somewhat optimistic diagnosis [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=109.92s)]
*  they say the cancer appears to be hormone sensitive allowing for effective management but of course it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=117.44s)]
*  is quite serious if it has spread to his bones again they're describing it as an aggressive [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=122.64s)]
*  form of prostate cancer. Frederica we have reached out to the White House for comment from the Trump [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  administration on this development and waiting to hear more from president Biden and his family [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=133.28s)]
*  as the time goes by. Right all of those words seem to be very alarming but then like you mentioned [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=139.2s)]
*  the statement being pacified by some optimism of a type of treatment that might be available I know [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=146.32s)]
*  you're going to continue to do some reporting and we'll check back with you thank you so much Betsy [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=153.2s)]
*  Klein for helping to break that news all right our Dana Bash is also on the line with us and so Dana [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=158.32s)]
*  from the information that Betsy is just conveying that this prostate nodule was discovered do we [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=163.92s)]
*  know anything about the a history well now he can be in charge of the oversight committee [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=171.04s)]
*  you know problems or nodules prior to this diagnosis that is now being announced and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  and shared that this is an aggressive form of prostate cancer [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=186.24s)]
*  Hi Frederica not that we know of look when you're talking about a president a former president [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  and his medical health we theoretically should know a lot if not everything about it so if [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=199.28s)]
*  there was a history that he personally had we you know would likely know about it and you know [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=210.72s)]
*  listen as you know I mean we all have people in our families who particularly men men of a certain [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=218.64s)]
*  age who get tested regularly for prostate cancer and as we saw in the statement they get a Gleason [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=226.16s)]
*  score and that determines whether or not they have prostate cancer and if so how aggressive it [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=236.16s)]
*  is like Betsy said the thing that is very concerning is that it is spread to his bones [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=242.32s)]
*  but look this is also a man who has had a son who died from cancer now former president Biden says [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=248.8s)]
*  that they believe that the reason Beau Biden got cancer very different kind of cancer brain cancer [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=259.12s)]
*  was because of exposure to burn pits while on a military mission we we never know we won't know [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=265.12s)]
*  if that's you know for sure 100 but what we do know now is that the former president is very lucky [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  in this sense he has the best care that pretty much anyone could get and there's no question [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=282.64s)]
*  that he is going to be they're going to find the best care as they say in this statement [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=290.32s)]
*  and the idea as you were saying Fred that it seems to be the kind of cancer that would respond to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=297.52s)]
*  hormones that's a very very big deal regardless of whether or not it is in his bones or not [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  all right I think we lost that signal I would Dana Bash will try to reestablish thank you so [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=316.32s)]
*  much Dana also with this David David Axelrod David I mean this is striking shocking news [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=319.84s)]
*  yes he is of a certain age 82 and prostate related problems can certainly arise at about this stage [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=327.76s)]
*  life but that his diagnosis according to that statement would come on Friday and it with the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=337.12s)]
*  use of aggressive form of prostate cancer hormone sensitive but I can't wait for the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=343.52s)]
*  liberals to talk about how uh up the left is for saying they don't care myself included that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=349.44s)]
*  we don't care that Biden has a prostate cancer president Biden as as you guys pointed out that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  Jake and Alex's book just came out it's getting a lot of attention a lot of reflection on his [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=364.88s)]
*  decisions to run again and that that that the rehashing of all of that can't be [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=370.48s)]
*  pleasant for him but this supersedes all of that obviously and you know he he's not a stranger to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=377.92s)]
*  medical crises he dealt with two brain aneurysms earlier in his life and almost lost his life as a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  result of that and was able to soldier through that he obviously has experienced a lot of tragedy [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=394.0s)]
*  in his life as well with a loss of uh of two children uh one by Karsten and his wife his [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=399.68s)]
*  first wife and of course the death of his son Bo he's you know Joe Biden is the unluckiest lucky [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=407.68s)]
*  man on the planet uh he's lived an incredible life of service uh you know 50 years of it [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=414.8s)]
*  um but he's also experienced untold tragedy and um I just you know whatever your political [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  persuasion whatever your feelings are about how his career ended whatever you think this is a good [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  and decent man uh who has served his country and uh we're all pulling for him yeah I mean as you [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=437.92s)]
*  mentioned this comes at a time where there is so much um and and continued attention uh you know [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=445.84s)]
*  placed on his mental acuity and stability um as well as ahead of this book release and you mentioned [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=453.52s)]
*  there's been a lot of discussion about it um his medical condition now his announced medical [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=461.67999999999995s)]
*  condition now do you believe that um silences or delays um a lot of conversations about [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=467.52s)]
*  his you know last year and a half of his presidency for now yeah well I mean I think those kind of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=477.76s)]
*  happen but they should be uh more muted and set aside uh for now as he's uh struggling [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  uh through this um I thought it was curing cancer not getting it dude what happened he said he was [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=494.08s)]
*  going to cure cancer jack it is it is it is it shouldn't be stunning because prostate cancer is [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=499.68s)]
*  so common among men uh at his stage in life most men if they live long enough uh deal with prostate [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=504.96s)]
*  cancer but and and it's great news that they think that it's manageable um but jarring nonetheless [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=513.12s)]
*  you know the thing for it is that people who serve in these offices uh they sort of become [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=521.84s)]
*  embedded in our lives and um you know and this is a reminder that that no one's immortal uh and and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=528.72s)]
*  so it's jarring and um I I had the I had the uh opportunity to serve with [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=540.72s)]
*  vice president biden for two years in the white house uh I can't believe that he's the one who [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=547.68s)]
*  got it and not like dick cheney and and everybody else too the uh uh concerns about health uh bo's [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=553.68s)]
*  health uh later on when I was working uh as a consultant to the campaign uh bo's health came [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=563.12s)]
*  to the fore and um I just feel for the family you know because it's one more thing why do they [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  glaze them so much even now what do you mean dude this is the primary directive of mainstream news [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=576.0s)]
*  is to whitewash and launder the reputation of war criminals once they are on the verge of death or [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=581.2s)]
*  after they pass and a navarro uh who it's a it's a major part of how this works uh former president [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=587.04s)]
*  biden and his wife dr jill biden were on the view last week ana uh I mean jarring is the word that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=594.96s)]
*  David Axelrod just used how would you describe how this news hits given that yours was one of the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  last big interviews with him last week ahead of his diagnosis um jarring is the word he's already [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  dead he's basically been propped up somebody you love or you he's basically been propped up with a [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=620.32s)]
*  stick up his ass that you know keeps his spine erect for the past multiple years at this point [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=626.08s)]
*  what do you mean he's been dead what are we talking about with fear it comes with it's not jarring [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=633.28s)]
*  wanting to figure out what the plan is what the next steps are what what the possibilities are [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=640.96s)]
*  for treatment what's you know I mean there's so many questions that come with that one diagnosis [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=647.84s)]
*  I will tell you one of the things that I know Joe Biden has going for him is his very strong face [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=653.36s)]
*  his incredible optimism his brain is doodoo he doesn't even know what any of this is strength [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  of family that have gone through so much together he's got a loving wife of decades and decades and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=667.6s)]
*  decades they have gone through so many ups and downs he's got children and grandchildren [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=674.88s)]
*  a sister just such as such a wide array of people who love him and will be with him at a time like [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=679.6s)]
*  this and I think it's part of the the reason Bose uh cancer the accident with his first wife that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=686.96s)]
*  cost the life of his first wife and his baby daughter it's part of the reason why Joe Biden [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  is a compassionate compassionate decent man that we know and it's part of the reason why he doesn't [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=700.08s)]
*  lose his optimism because he knows that from sometimes the depths of sorrow and the biggest [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=706.24s)]
*  he's neither a compassionate nor a decent man this is bullshit he's neither a compassionate [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=711.92s)]
*  nor decent person the joe biden i've known for almost three decades is a man who I know will [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=718.16s)]
*  fight it's a man who will have people who love him on his in his corner is a man who will have [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=724.4s)]
*  the best medical advice and these are things that he does not take for granted because he knows [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  he knows not every American has the best medical advice and the best medical treatments available [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=738.88s)]
*  and he knows not every American has the family structure that he has and I think that's why he [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=745.36s)]
*  tried so hard to bring health care to Americans and and and and why time and time again we show [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=751.84s)]
*  we saw him show his heart to America we saw him hug people who had diagnoses like this we saw him [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=760.4s)]
*  hug family members who had lost somebody because of everything he has gone through so you know I [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  I just join I think most Americans hopefully all Americans in praying for him and wishing him well [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=775.6s)]
*  and knowing that prostate cancer today many forms of prostate cancer are very treatable [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=785.76s)]
*  and you can have many more years of life afterwards I have dealt with it in my family [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=792.24s)]
*  and and I know you know I know Joe Biden hasn't hasn't given up his entire life [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=799.04s)]

*  so far advanced meaning Gleason 9 metastasized to the bone the five-year survival rate is somewhere [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  between 30 and 40 percent again depending on how well he responds to therapy one of the questions [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1084.96s)]
*  on everyone's mind and you just heard this from the reporter is what about last year's PSA you [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1092.32s)]
*  know this was found by physical examination by a prostate exam a lot of times we find an elevation [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1098.0s)]
*  in prostate specific antigen a PSA and then we go after it get an MRI I mean he must have had the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  best possible care here I just I'm a little taken aback that it's this far advanced and very very [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1110.56s)]
*  concerned about it yeah that's the question I was going to ask you this is a former president of the [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1117.04s)]
*  United States he's supposed to be getting as you say the best medical care in the world and yet [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1121.92s)]
*  you know just a few months after he leaves office this prostate cancer is advanced enough that it [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1127.68s)]
*  has metastasized to the bone that's well that's just not good no and then we don't have enough [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1133.28s)]
*  information for me to be sure of the following statement but I want everyone to know that the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  PSA though I think it's a really great test and I do it on every mail over the age of 45 [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  sometimes it can be low and you still could have this it's not 100% I'm not saying his was low it [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1151.52s)]
*  wasn't written as as I don't recall it being indicated there but if it's high you go after it [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1157.44s)]
*  and again to reach the point of symptoms we often off most of the time we can diagnose it before [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1165.12s)]
*  although you know it may very well be that he's hormone responsive and that's as a casual lurker [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1172.48s)]
*  I will have to step away from you your level of crassness is worth unsubscribing oh no only [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1178.32s)]
*  logged in to let you know I think you're very researched opinionated politically astute and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1184.0s)]
*  extremely extremely crass yeah don't worry goodbye at this point it is as you say one of the most [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1188.48s)]
*  treatable forms of cancer but you have to catch it fairly early right [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1201.6799999999998s)]
*  well you have to catch it fair if you catch it while it's still within the capsule within [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1209.4399999999998s)]
*  the prostate itself it's curable most of the time when it's metastasized like here to the bone [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  much less so and again this aggressive very concerning means that it probably spread pretty [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1220.32s)]
*  fast they might try to radiate that lesion they found on the bone they're definitely going to [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1226.56s)]
*  give hormone therapy here they'll know more in a few months about how responsive it is when you [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1231.36s)]
*  the goal is to get it before it leaves the prostate when it's left the prostate it becomes much [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1236.1599999999999s)]

*  effort to ensure that there wasn't enough time to replace him okay dookie him and all of the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1291.6s)]

*  noticed that yet i've been saying this now since the debate he is literally trying to [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1334.32s)]
*  desperately get to the convention so it becomes a matter of like it's not even a question at that [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1342.3999999999999s)]

*  will be the wrong party here that's it do you think that joe biden really would have been able [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1387.44s)]
*  to perform as president all the way through january 2029 when he would have been when he would be 86 [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1394.48s)]

*  a bit concerned about his schedule in the run-up to the debate he took two overseas trips came back [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1486.32s)]
*  and started prepared for that debate uh and i called it at the time preparation overload [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1493.68s)]
*  because they were cramming the into a four or five four five day period uh the preparation for the [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1499.92s)]
*  debate after taking two overseas trips which i thought was taxing in and of itself and so these [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1505.76s)]
*  kinds of concerns are out there uh but none of us thought uh that there was anything here that created [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1512.16s)]
*  any suspicions of any prolonged condition are you scared of being yelled at by liberals or do you [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=1519.12s)]

*  well in those snippets of audio that have been released do you think that this diagnosis in any [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2035.1200000000001s)]
*  way um changes the equation does it does it bring more sympathy forward for the former president [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2041.3600000000001s)]

*  i think it's a great question i don't know the answer to that but certainly i think the [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2054.7999999999997s)]

*  uh the former president anyone who's ever uh heard a physician tell them that they have cancer [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2662.24s)]
*  understands how uncertain and disorienting and terrifying these times can be so so my thoughts [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2667.76s)]
*  go to the former president and and his family so so prostate cancer is extraordinarily common about [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2674.88s)]
*  one in eight men in this country will get prostate cancer during their their lifetime and you know [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2681.6000000000004s)]

*  hormone therapy what we've heard so far uh sort of bad news and good news the bad news [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2694.64s)]
*  is that his gleason score which is how the pathologists grade the aggressiveness of the [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2700.7999999999997s)]
*  tumor by by looking at it under the microscope was quite high the gleason score goes from one to [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2707.36s)]
*  ten one being the best ten being the worst and his tumor was graded as a nine so a very aggressive [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2714.4s)]
*  form uh the second adverse uh diagnostic uh information that we've received is the fact that [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2719.84s)]
*  it's now already uh metastatic to bone so it's no longer contained in the prostate so this is not [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2726.48s)]
*  something have some bloody respect goslass hospital for 10 000 cancer patients shuts down reported [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2732.4s)]

*  the body we're told that it's spread to the bone but there are treatment options uh where the good [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2747.52s)]
*  news is that uh we're told that uh the former president's particular tumor appears to be [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2752.96s)]
*  sensitive to hormone therapy uh the male hormone testosterone causes prostate cancers to grow so [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2759.28s)]
*  blocking a test testosterone is a for the record a lot of people in the shadow saying well palestinians [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2767.28s)]
*  have no access to cancer uh treatment because of joe biden and now donald trump right and before [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2773.68s)]
*  people say oh this is like saying they're starving children in africa make no mistake [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2781.52s)]

*  biden is almost single-handedly directly responsible for israel's endless bombing campaign [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2800.8s)]
*  as he had every opportunity to shut it down early on and refuse to do so so much so that he allowed [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2806.96s)]
*  this election to be lost to donald trump right path for him going forward and i just want to [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2814.96s)]
*  make sure i'm understanding when when we when they say it is hormone sensitive and that's a good news [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2820.96s)]
*  you're saying if you can block that testosterone which is of course a hormone that that can yeah [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2825.84s)]
*  they're going to block bimonides brandon hope or they hope for the fact that it would give them a [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2830.4s)]
*  little more control over that cancer yeah and i and i think in an 82 year old uh patient what [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2834.48s)]
*  you're really trying to do is uh control control the cancer prevent the cancer uh from you know [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2841.6800000000003s)]
*  spreading more widely uh spreading to you know organs you know like the liver or the or the lungs [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2848.88s)]
*  uh and trying trying to control it for as as long as as you can and uh being hormone sensitive [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2854.56s)]
*  gives them the option of using these uh androgen blocking therapies and then the other piece of [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2861.6800000000003s)]
*  information that you were going through as well was this i was this information that it has [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2868.88s)]
*  spread to his bones that it has metastasized when you hear that that does sound daunting [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2873.76s)]
*  uh what is that painful what what else does that you know what what else does that mean [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2879.7599999999998s)]
*  for the patient in this case yeah it can certainly cause bone pain right and you know once the the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2885.3599999999997s)]
*  tumor starts uh affecting affecting the bones particularly the long bones uh particularly [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2891.52s)]
*  bones of the legs and things like that um and back uh but you know the more important aspect [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2898.64s)]
*  of the fact that it's metastatic to bone is that it really does change or metastatic period is that [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2906.0s)]
*  it does change the uh the prognosis sometimes you know people with early prostate cancer generally [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2911.52s)]
*  not fatal with a five-year survival rate of over 95 for most patients assuming ex-president biden [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2917.36s)]
*  is under close surveillance his likelihood of dying from natural causes higher of course the [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2921.68s)]
*  specific subtype matters in patients with gleece and score of nine the five-year survival rate is [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2925.68s)]
*  typically around 50 to 70 i thought it was 30 not 50 to 70 but yeah i mean look i'm not you know [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2930.4s)]
*  and you know when oncologists talk to who knows it's important for the patients to understand [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2939.76s)]
*  that they are not a statistic and if they look at google and they look at that number [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2946.32s)]
*  and they look at a number that says for instance that five-year survival rate is 33 you know that [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2950.88s)]
*  can be very very uh dispiriting but what i think a lot of doctors would would tell a patient what [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2956.72s)]
*  i would tell the patient if i were an oncologist is that statistics are for 100 people and what [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2963.2799999999997s)]
*  they should only be interested is what is their outlook what are the features of their tumor and [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2968.72s)]
*  their overall condition uh where does that where does that point them and to me it sounds like [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2974.64s)]
*  there's a lot to do here and so i would if i were involved in the president's care and i have not [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2980.4s)]
*  i would tell them look we have a lot to do now we'll take things one at a time [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2987.6s)]
*  and we'll pick a comprehensive cancer center to help structure your treatment and i'm sure that's [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2991.76s)]
*  what president biden's team is doing they're looking for a comprehensive cancer like i just [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=2999.76s)]
*  i don't god not only do i not care because this is happening in the backdrop of of [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3004.24s)]
*  biden's actions and his in his gross ambition to continue starving the palestinian population [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3010.24s)]
*  and killing them directly has led to tens of thousands of palestinians not being able to get [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3014.72s)]
*  this kind of medical care coverage but biden also for 50 years was a very ambitious person [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3021.12s)]
*  uh was able to basically hold on to the grips of power and became the president and used that [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3028.7200000000003s)]
*  opportunity to do a metric ton of evil and on top of that he is going to have platinum health care [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3035.6s)]
*  coverage there are people in this country right now that have cancer that have the same type of [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3042.16s)]
*  cancer that fucking joe biden has that are spending their last moments not with their [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3047.28s)]
*  fucking families but instead talking to insurance agents okay like who we show what level of support [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aE8U3PWQw&t=3054.16s)]
