# When Will Inmate Firefighters Receive Fair Pay? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY)
*  Around 1600 incarcerated people work as firefighters in California, making up as much as 15% of the state firefighting force, Cal Fire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=0.0s)]
*  16% of the total fighting force, sometimes is up to upwards of 30 fighters out on the line are incarcerated. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=9.6s)]
*  Anyway, let's get to, I don't really care about Pan Bondi, honestly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=16.12s)]
*  We'll do some updates on the California wildfires and move on. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=25.12s)]
*  The fire emergency in Los Angeles. The most severe wind warning is in effect again this morning, threatening to start new fires, spread existing ones. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=31.12s)]
*  This new danger comes as we also learn new information about what may have sparked the Palisades fire. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to cover Pan Bondi because I don't care. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=44.12s)]
*  Chief National correspondent Matt Gutman is on the scene. Good morning, Matt. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=46.12s)]
*  Hey, good morning, George. The next 11 hours here are going to be absolutely critical. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=49.12s)]
*  Very low humidity. The winds are going to come howling down canyons like this, which is why fire officials have pre-positioned so many trucks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=54.12s)]
*  In almost every driveway here, this goes on and on. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=63.12s)]
*  In all about 15,000 firefighters in Southern California right now, they are concerned that these winds could whip up embers and ignite new fires here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=66.12s)]
*  This morning for the second straight day, millions facing an extreme fire risk in Southern California. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=76.12s)]
*  The next 12 hours critical. Everybody here urges you to remain alert as danger has not yet passed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=82.12s)]
*  Fire crews scrambling to mop up any remaining hot spots, fearing that powerful Santa Ana winds and dry conditions could rekindle monstrous Eaton and Palisades fires. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=89.12s)]
*  Palisades fire now 18% contained as new clues emerge about how it may have started. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=99.12s)]
*  ABC News has learned that the ATF, the federal agent... [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=104.12s)]
*  Your tweet that made me come to that stream seems right wing, which is upsetting, being left wing. Stop trying to suck up to them. Wait, what? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=107.12s)]
*  Like to give money to a leftist from other side of the sea. Thanks for your commentary. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=114.12s)]
*  What? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=119.12s)]
*  Your tweet made me come to that stream seems right wing, which is upsetting, being left wing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=120.12s)]
*  Stop trying to suck up to them. I'm trying to understand what you're saying. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=125.12s)]
*  Are you saying you expected me to be right wing? Or are you saying that you saw my tweet and it seemed right wing focused? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=129.12s)]
*  Let's continue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=136.12s)]
*  Is just a man we needed a time on. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=137.12s)]
*  Wrong one. Hold on. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=140.12s)]
*  An agency charged with investigating arson and explosions is zeroing in on the Palisades Highland area. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=141.12s)]
*  The fire started real close to where the last fire was on New Year's Eve. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=147.12s)]
*  Some residents pointing to this fire first reported on the hillside just after midnight on New Year's Day. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=152.12s)]
*  LAFD had sent helicopters and had sent trucks to put that fire out. They were there for hours circling overhead. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=158.12s)]
*  We assumed then the fire was out for the next several nights. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=165.12s)]
*  There were fireworks again going off at night in various areas in the hills. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=170.12s)]
*  By three thirty eight a.m. The fire is stopped and an hour later by four forty six fully contained. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=175.12s)]
*  Fire officials say that ash pits or tree roots can smolder for days unseen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=180.12s)]
*  We were right behind it. Then at ten thirty a.m. Tuesday, January. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=185.12s)]
*  The crazy thing is these guys got blamed for the wildfire. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=188.12s)]
*  And now the most likely the most likely scenario is that it's a reignition from a previous fire fire that was put out because someone else had lit fireworks during New Year's Eve. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=192.12s)]
*  Yeah, they hit him with the with the fart principle. Whoever smelt it dealt it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=210.12s)]
*  That's what they did. They were like, oh, you were there. Oh, yeah, I was on I was on CNN. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=215.12s)]
*  We'll look at that in a second with the Bernie. We got some hits off the Bernie interview. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=220.12s)]
*  The Palisades fire was reported. These side by side satellite images seem to show that fire starting at nearly the same spot as the fire the week before. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=224.12s)]
*  We witnessed the furious firefighting efforts at that spot as the Palisades fire began to spread. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=233.12s)]
*  Just in the past couple of seconds since we've been here, this fire has crested this little hail. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=239.12s)]
*  We're on the entire base in here is engulfed in flames. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=244.12s)]
*  Fema on the ground in L.A., already receiving 40000 aid applications. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=249.12s)]
*  Eighty four year old Susan Sulser says she watched the Palisades fire approach her home from her kitchen window before fighting the fire with her 86 year old husband Winston saving their home. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=254.12s)]
*  I wasn't sure where Winston was. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=266.12s)]
*  Couldn't contact him, but it turned out he was at the south end of the house doing the same thing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=270.12s)]
*  The Palisades and fires have claimed the lives of 25 people and the survivors are still reeling. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=276.12s)]
*  It was literally shooting like fireballs. It looked like a volcano. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=282.12s)]
*  Zaira Calvin remembers the Eaton fire surging towards the place he's called home for 47 years. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=288.12s)]
*  I got the baby. I'm getting my mother. We're going. I go to the left and my sister's car is still there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=293.12s)]
*  He says he thought his sister, Evelyn McClendon, had managed to leave already. The next day they located her. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=300.12s)]
*  When you mourn your sister's death, there's no real understanding. There's no understanding. There's no way to even take it in. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=307.12s)]
*  The family hit hard, but not giving up on their community. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=315.12s)]
*  Everyone is fighting. Everyone is literally just asking, leaning on each other to say what's next. What's the best thing to do? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=319.12s)]
*  Folks like Zaira Calvin say that they can rebuild. They just need the financial resources and support in order to do it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=328.12s)]
*  Now something that authorities here are very concerned about. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=335.12s)]
*  Over the past eight days, there have been three particularly dangerous situation alerts put out by the National Weather Service. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=338.12s)]
*  There have also been some mistaken text alerts on that emergency alert system put out by the county. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=346.12s)]
*  And officials are concerned there will be complacency. But they are pleading with folks to heed those warnings. They say lives are at stake. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=353.12s)]
*  Michael. You can definitely feel the heartbreak there and definitely need to take those warnings seriously. Thank you so much, Matt. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=361.12s)]
*  Wall Street Journal did a firefighters are fighting fires for less than two dollars an hour piece. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=367.12s)]
*  This is a group of wildland firefighters. This is the main palisades fire. So they're tasked with going up these steep hills and protecting these expensive houses from burning down. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=373.12s)]
*  Seven years, wildland, 61 fires. I've called about 30 of those out. I've had one restart about 90 days later. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=386.12s)]
*  It can reignite 90 days after the fact. That sounds insane. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=393.12s)]
*  Thousands of firefighters have come from all around the country to battle the still raging Los Angeles fires. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=397.12s)]
*  This crew came from a camp. So these are inmates in the California penal system. These guys all volunteered to come out here. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=406.12s)]
*  And this is a major labor force for California. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=414.12s)]
*  Around 1600 incarcerated people work as firefighters in California, making up as much as 15 percent of the state firefighting force. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=417.12s)]
*  16 percent of the total fighting force, sometimes it's upwards of 30 fighters out on the line, are incarcerated. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=427.12s)]
*  We work 24 on 24 off. We won't be out of here until 6, 7 in the morning. It's kind of surreal. You know what I mean? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=434.12s)]
*  This is California history down here. I mean, we're in Hollywood. It's better than being locked in a cell. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=441.12s)]
*  We're basically free out here. Is the pay a little rough? I get a dollar an hour right now and I'm one of the highest paid guys on the crew. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=446.12s)]
*  Incarcerated firefighters get between five and ten dollars a day. When they're assigned to a fire, they earn an extra dollar an hour. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=453.12s)]
*  By contrast, a firefighter hired by Cal Fire to do similar work ends up earning about three hundred and fifty dollars for a 24 hour shift, not including overtime. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=461.12s)]
*  But the bigger draw is early release serving on a fire. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=471.12s)]
*  OK, Cal Fire's numbers are so insanely low as well, by the way. That's crazy. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=475.12s)]
*  Dude, dude, do you understand you're working 24 hours on 24 hours off? You're sleeping in the mountains. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=483.12s)]
*  You can't even bring a bed with you. Like you can't bring like a sleeping bag with you because everything else you're carrying could potentially become an issue in a fire. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=490.12s)]
*  And every everything you're carrying has you have to have the light is lowered basically because you're trekking for 24 hours. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=499.12s)]
*  OK, and even even the people that are fighting the wildfires that aren't incarcerated or making two three hundred fifty dollars for a full 24 hour shift. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=507.12s)]
*  Like that's the maxed out hazard pay. Also being on the Sawyer team, those guys have to take tests and train for more than a year to be able to do that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=518.12s)]
*  These dudes are legit. Yeah, like I when I think about that, not even the incarcerated, the people who are not incarcerated. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=526.12s)]
*  And then I compare that to the police salaries for sitting around playing Candy Crush, waiting for like some some black or brown teenager to roll over with an electric scooter so I can shoot them and then be like, I killed a looter. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=533.12s)]
*  And how much hazard pay and overtime pay they actually rack up in that same time frame. I'm like, what are we doing? Our spending priorities are so out of whack. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=545.12s)]
*  Bro, three fifty a day is still great. Are you crazy? We're talking about 24 hours. You're working for 24 hours. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=554.12s)]
*  Under conditions that are deadly, like you can die. What dog you're talking about? You're talking about fourteen fifty an hour. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=561.12s)]
*  That's lower than the California minimum wage. Why? Because Cal Fire, like people that work in the forestry service, are federal employees, as in they make less money. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=570.12s)]
*  They make the least amount of money in the federal government. They're making fifteen bucks an hour, dude. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=581.12s)]
*  Three hundred fifty for 24 hours is insane. I mean, three fifty for twelve hours of production assistant and that's not fighting fires. That's what I'm saying. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=587.12s)]
*  Yeah. Cal Fire State yet before overtime and Cal Fire State. Oh, Cal Fire is not federal pay. I thought Cal Fire also had the pay that was like similar to federal pay. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=594.12s)]
*  Am I wrong on this? I'm sure there are some wildfire firefighters in here. I mean, it doesn't matter. It's extra messed up if they're getting only three hundred fifty dollars a day for a 24 hour time frame that they're working. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=607.12s)]
*  Our crew gets time shaved off your sentence and a chance to get your record expunged. We're here for the opportunity to reduce our time. Anything I can do to go home day or two earlier, I'm going to be there to do it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=620.12s)]
*  After a 24 hour. No, US Forest Service guys envy the Cal Fire. They make about three X federal salary. Really? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=631.12s)]
*  Or shift and then a 24 hour rest. The crew is back at work. Now the job changes from fighting fires to helping prevent them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=637.12s)]
*  This is the arduous work of just clearing this area and making sure it's safe and stopping the fires before they start. This is work that these guys do all year round. It doesn't just happen when there's wildfires. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=647.12s)]
*  We do this Monday through Friday. This is what we do every day. Fire or not. When we talk to other groups and they're doing the same stuff we're doing and we talk to them about how much you guys getting paid. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=658.12s)]
*  How much you guys getting paid? Oh, we're getting paid $20 an hour. We're getting paid this much a day. He'd be like, dang, at the end of the month we probably make like $100. Something that somebody probably making like half a day. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=669.12s)]
*  Kip Ford says his time on the fire crew has been an attempt at redemption. He's in his walk as a cops that are overseeing them like the CEOs are getting paid probably double overtime and hazard pay in the process. They also don't go out on the line, I suspect. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=680.12s)]
*  After being convicted of construction fraud in the aftermath of the 2018 campfire in Paradise, California, a verdict is appealed. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=694.12s)]
*  I have a part of my past that I'm not 100% proud of. Well, I just hope that I have did all I can to right that wrong as best I could. We were up there fighting them fires this year as a crew as a team. The Park fire, the Thompson fire, the Apache fire. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=703.12s)]
*  But just to go to say, you know, that's what do they say is karma. All I can do is move, move forward. And that's how I justify the day. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMWaLP0ufY&t=719.12s)]
