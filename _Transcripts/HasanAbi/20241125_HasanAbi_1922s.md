# The YouTube Content Wasteland | Hasanabi Reacts to Noah Samsen
**HasanAbi:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w)
*  She ends by apologizing to Chud for going back on her word to not leak the messages, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=0.0s)]
*  but reiterates what she said at the start that she is doing this with the goal of protecting other [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=4.64s)]
*  young people. So what about this thread communicates ill intent? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=9.28s)]
*  Okay, open and shut case. Who is defending this? There are people who are making YouTube videos [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=12.96s)]
*  defending this? Like what the fuck? They're actually they're blaming a minor. They're [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=17.92s)]
*  actively blaming a minor for for like, being groomed by [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=23.12s)]
*  good stuff. All right, let's see the YouTube content wasteland. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Last month, I started a video series in response to a video called Why I Hate Breadtubers from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  the YouTuber Rob's Media. I didn't end up finishing it because towards the end of the series, I had a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=42.0s)]
*  change of heart in the direction that I want to take this channel. There are things happening in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=46.56s)]
*  the world right now that I think are important and not getting enough coverage on YouTube, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=50.08s)]
*  namely the genocide in Gaza. While I had previously covered it on my channel, that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=54.0s)]
*  coverage was interspersed between internet drama videos and making fun of weird guys. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And that's all fine, right? But after spending a month making videos exclusively about Gaza, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=61.92s)]
*  I discovered that I really do not want to talk about anything else. Not right now, at least. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=66.56s)]
*  There's too much suffering, too many lies justifying that suffering and not enough people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=70.64s)]
*  talking about it on YouTube. For this reason, I have no desire to return to online drama content. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=75.04s)]
*  I've been working every day, 12 hours a day for the last three weeks on a big video that's related [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  to media coverage of the Gaza genocide. And I have a few others in the chamber. I'm excited for you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=84.64s)]
*  all to see them. With that said, though, there are some loose ends in the drama sphere that I want to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=89.28s)]
*  tie up first, starting with Rob's Media. Rob responded to my videos. So that's what we're [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  going to look at today. Hopefully it'll be a nice break from the really heavy stuff as well, if that's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=97.92s)]
*  been too much for you to watch. So that's the plan. But first, real quick, I want to thank the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=101.92s)]
*  sponsor of today's video, Lalo. Lalo makes some really high quality bedroom equipment for going [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=106.4s)]
*  bonkers on yourself and others. Massive L haircut? Oh, shut up. He looks good. Noah's always been a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=111.6s)]
*  babe. OK, he's always been a hottie. Lalo was kind enough to send me the Tor 3 and the F1S V3. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=117.6s)]
*  And these things are amazing. The Tor 3. Wait, what the f**k? Hey, yo, OK. Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=125.44s)]
*  I can't show this. I don't know if I can show this. OK, I didn't even realize what the f**k he was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=132.0s)]
*  selling. No, I think that is a cock ring. Anyway, Noah Lalo 10 for 10% off. OK, god damn. This man, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=138.72s)]
*  dude, it's a cock ring. OK, back to the video. So Rob's Media called responding to Noah Sampson, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  which makes sense as a name for the video. Love the thumbnail. Looking good. It's another pretty [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=152.32s)]
*  long video, so I will need to break this up into parts again. Sorry. Again, I got other stuff to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  put out in the meantime, but don't worry, Rob, I won't forget you. Never forget Rob. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=160.48s)]
*  So I've been wanting to respond to Noah Sampson's coverage of my Why I Hate Breadtubers video, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  which he decided to split into multiple parts for some reason. Unlike him, I don't like wasting my [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=168.72s)]
*  audience's time, so I'll only be going over the main egregious points Noah made. I'll link all of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=173.12s)]
*  his videos below. Don't harass the guy, obviously. I'm linking them for full transparency. I like [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  that, linking the videos. I think it's good practice. More YouTubers should do that. Academic. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=182.16s)]
*  As for the comment about me wasting people's time, whether it's one big video or chapters, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=186.8s)]
*  I'd be wasting their time regardless. The content itself is a waste of time. I am sorry though if [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=191.52s)]
*  you feel like your time was wasted. Some of my viewers felt the same way and just sat the series [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  out or unsubscribed, which is totally cool. I get it. I just let the market decide and the market [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  told me to stop making them. What really caught my attention of Noah's responses is the downright [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=205.84s)]
*  slanderous stuff he said about YouTuber, streamer, and fat British guy Chud Logic. In my original [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  video, I brought up this infamous Noah tweet where he calls Chud a pedo and insists he should [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=215.36s)]
*  be brutally killed. I'll address this tweet more later, but let's focus on the important part. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=219.36s)]
*  Noah is outright trying to paint Chud as a p***y, something no other YouTuber agrees with. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=224.0s)]
*  Mouse a dog. Okay. Good one, dude. What is it? Love is all around. Is that what it is? It's like [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=245.36s)]
*  the five hearts and under one roof. Love and four hearts. Is it love is all around for real? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  Is it love is all around? Actually, that's the one four hearts is Korean. I already did that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=257.76s)]
*  Hi chat. If you like the Chinese dating games, here are some English subtitles. Also, I know [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  Jason already played three of them. Love is all around. Try and love knowledge or no lady. My [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=268.88s)]
*  destiny girl. She had been asking to play this game for weeks now. Love in the room. Love is all [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=275.28s)]
*  around DLC. Oh my God. Oh my God. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, look at all these games [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=279.12s)]
*  that I must avoid. Look at all these games that I will be avoided. I will not be white. What what's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=288.0s)]
*  what do you, I will certainly now be chat might be saying that I'm a, you know, I see a lot of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  movement in the chat. Like, Oh dude, you're downloading. It's like, I'm not, I'm not downloading it [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=301.28s)]
*  and I'm certainly not installing it. Love is all around. I mean, I would never, I would never do [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=306.08s)]
*  that right here, mom. Oh, okay. The steam tags are FMV and dating simulator to find games like five [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=311.68s)]
*  hearts. I would never do that. I would never do that in a million years. Okay. It's clear to me [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  that I'm, you know, it's clear that I would never, everybody knows I mistakenly clicked on the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  previous dating sim. And we just kind of looked at it to see what's not good. In my video, I retracted [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=330.56s)]
*  the accusation that chud logic was a file, but I did it in sort of a backhanded way. I'll play that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  now. So yes, technically you guys got me. He's not at a he's in the fever file. He's not a file. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=342.96s)]
*  He's in the fever file and a weirdo and a groomer. So yeah, I do want to unequivocally retract that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=348.8s)]
*  he's a that I called him a wait. That's what everyone was mad about. Like people were bullying. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=354.0s)]
*  People were bullying Noah Sampson into, into doing actually it's a fever file shit. Yeah. Well, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=359.2s)]
*  look at the all endings of this game in a second. What the I shouldn't have done that. And I'm sorry [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=365.2s)]
*  to chud logic for doing that. I got some feedback from CSA survivors about how we shouldn't throw [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=370.56s)]
*  that word around without evidence because it cheapens the words meaning. And I think that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=374.72s)]
*  makes perfect sense. I've always loved internet humor like this, you know, extreme hyperbolic [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=378.24s)]
*  insults, like quote tweeting a Zionist that's mocking Palestinians being killed and saying, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=382.56s)]
*  Hey chat, someone should probably beat this guy to death with hammers or in chud's case, you know, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=386.88s)]
*  he was putting scantily clad photos on the thumbnails of videos that were scrutinizing [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=390.8s)]
*  sexual assault allegations. Hey guys, we should melt this guy in cast iron cauldron. It's ridiculous. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=395.04s)]
*  It's a product of Twitter culture and it's always been hilarious to me. What I've learned over time [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=400.4s)]
*  though, is that doing this is not worth it. It's not worth the trade off and punishment. I got [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=405.36s)]
*  banned from Twitter for this and other similar statements. My cope for almost two years now has [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=409.68s)]
*  been that I was leaving anyways, and that Elon broke the site and made it Nazi site. And that's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=414.48s)]
*  true. Why didn't he just like demand that he be unbanned by doing the trick, which is woke liberals [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=419.68s)]
*  canceled me. Because if you say woke liberals cancel me like as a 100% on ban rate. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=426.48s)]
*  True in part, I've been on blue sky lately and it's 10 billion times better. You should follow me on [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=431.92s)]
*  there if you want. However, having access to my audience on other platforms is genuinely pretty [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  helpful, especially when it comes to the more serious political side of things like the stuff [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  I've been covering lately. It would be nice to be able to talk about it with you know, my audience [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=445.68s)]
*  and the people I know. But thanks to stuff like this, I don't have that anymore, which sucks. So [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  to anyone that wants to do content online, as funny as it may feel to post stuff like this or [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=453.84s)]
*  make hyperbolic death threats as fun as the word. What is this? Wait, what? What was that? It said [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  downloaded. I don't know. I don't know what that was. Damn it. Must have been a virus again. I [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=464.23999999999995s)]
*  think the hackers hacked into my computer and downloaded something for me. It is to throw around [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=470.32s)]
*  that people you don't like if you don't have any real evidence to go off of then just keep that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=477.12s)]
*  offline. Anyways, let's continue. In early 2021, a Twitter user made a thread detailing her [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=481.12s)]
*  experience of Chad the year prior. She said she was a fan of his and he'd messaged her first with [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=486.08s)]
*  this glorious image. Hey, it was at Muthahar. I think Rob is trying to make a joke here and say [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=490.8s)]
*  that this guy looks like Muthahar from some ordinary gamers. But these guys look nothing [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=496.0s)]
*  alike. I think Rob just identified their one common feature, Brown and did a bit off of that. But come [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=501.2s)]
*  on, like it's not even remotely close. Wait, so there's like actual YouTubers out there that are [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=507.6s)]
*  just like making long convoluted YouTube videos like defending people who are actually a Feeba [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=512.4s)]
*  files and like groomers and shit. Like actually, is everybody okay? Like what is going on? Is [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=522.96s)]
*  everybody all right? What's happening? I'm so happy to just be completely oblivious to that side of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=529.28s)]
*  the world. This is why I don't look at any of the drama slop usually. That's crazy. They'd sent [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=535.6s)]
*  messages back and forth for months, usually being flirty or inappropriate. Sure, they're weird and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=540.4s)]
*  creepy, but you can say that for any leaked sexual exchanges. I don't know about that one. I think [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=544.96s)]
*  you can definitely sex without being weird or creepy. I think suggesting otherwise is kind of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  a self-report. Maybe what he means here is that it's, you know, cringe seeing people horny texting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=553.52s)]
*  outside of the- What is Destiny doing? He's just like reviewing the- Like is he doing like [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  pedicure review? Like what the fuck is this? It's just like a streamlined- What's up guys? Today [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=562.96s)]
*  we're going to be doing pedicure review. It turns out, you know, it's actually a Feeba file. Is that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=568.16s)]
*  what it is? He's being flirty or inappropriate. He judges their groomer is? Okay, that's nice. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=575.04s)]
*  And people horny texting outside of the context in which they were horny, which I generally agree [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=581.6s)]
*  with, but weird and creepy every time? Nah, man. At one point, Judd says that he doesn't want to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=586.64s)]
*  flirt with someone who's a young adult. With his limit being someone half his age plus seven, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=591.92s)]
*  Judd was 34 at the time, meaning the youngest he flirt with is 24. Like she said, she said herself, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  oh, um, I said that I was 18 and never, never really made a big deal out of this idea that I [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=601.76s)]
*  was some sort of ****hole, but that became the narrative. That became the narrative that grew [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=606.64s)]
*  up off the back of it. This point is odd from Rob. Judd was under the impression that this girl was [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=610.8s)]
*  18, but if his age limit was supposed to be 24, then he broke his own rule, right? Like he knew [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=615.92s)]
*  it was wrong, but he did it anyways. Um, that was my original point. Rob doesn't argue against that, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=621.76s)]
*  though. He actually just follows it up by immediately accusing the girl of trying to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  ruin Judd's career. So yeah, this Haley person lied about their age and is now playing victim [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=630.0s)]
*  while trying to ruin Judd's career. I think because he and others disagree that Judd was [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=634.72s)]
*  being predatory at all, then that must mean that she was acting maliciously by making these [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=639.2s)]
*  accusations. This is unfair in my opinion, because when we read through what Haley actually said, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=644.08s)]
*  it seems pretty clear from the tone and from what she said that that's not what was happening. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=648.88s)]
*  She starts by giving her reasoning that she feels morally obligated to say something for the safety [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  of other young people in her community before making any accusations. The first thing she does [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=669.12s)]
*  is admit to fault about lying about her age and posting not suitable for work content in the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=673.76s)]
*  discord. She calls these mistakes and apologizes for them. She also communicates that she feels [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=678.8s)]
*  ashamed for even having to share this exchange. She admits with embarrassment to feeling special [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  and attached, but still feeling uncomfortable because of his messages. And she also admits [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=688.4s)]
*  to knowing from the start that Judd was in his mid thirties. She ends by apologizing to Judd [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=692.8s)]
*  for going back on her word to not leak the messages, but reiterates what she said at the start that she [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  is doing this with the goal of protecting other young people. So what about this thread communicates [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=702.8s)]
*  ill intent. Okay, open and shut case. Who is defending this? There are people who are making [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=707.6s)]
*  YouTube videos defending this. Like what the f***? They're actually they're blaming a minor. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  They're actively blaming a minor for like being groomed by a f***ing 34 year old man. Like what? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=718.4s)]
*  Who's doing this? I feel like you can disagree. Why are people making YouTube videos? Like why [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=727.28s)]
*  are they not embarrassed to say these things? Charges without demonizing this person by assuming [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=734.0s)]
*  that she was acting maliciously by assuming that she was just trying to yeah, cause she lied about [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=739.2s)]
*  her age is really dumb. Diddy tube ruin this guy's life for no reason. Watching back some of the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=743.52s)]
*  responses at the time further illustrates this point. I think take destiny even reading all of [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=749.68s)]
*  the messages. He starts out by framing this accuser in relation to other accusers that only [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=754.4s)]
*  make accusations out of regret. Somebody flirting with you and like typing sexual messages at you [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=759.76s)]
*  is not grooming. What the f*** do you guys think grooming is? What is grooming? It sounds to me [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=765.28s)]
*  like every single attempt at flirting is grooming to you people. That's f***ing- What is going on, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=770.72s)]
*  bro? I don't- Is it only grooming if it's a content creator that is not in your orbit? I guess that's [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  the standard, right? It's like if it's like a minecrafter or like someone you don't like, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=780.8s)]
*  then it's grooming. If it's a 34 year old man talking to a 17 year old girl in his discord, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=787.44s)]
*  who's a fan and is like getting them to send revealing compromising pictures and stuff like [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=792.72s)]
*  that, that's not grooming technically because you like that content creator. Is that how it works? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=799.36s)]
*  It's only grooming against his enemies. F***ing disgusting. You guys are dumb as f***. Like every [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=807.2s)]
*  single attempt at flirting is grooming to you people. That's f***ing disgusting. You guys are [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=812.96s)]
*  dumb as f***. If you think you don't know what grooming means, just don't use it as a word. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=817.0400000000001s)]
*  Jesus. Grooming equals guy hit on me and later on I decided that I wasn't really into it. When he [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=820.96s)]
*  actually goes through the thread, he reads them mockingly, setting it up so that whatever comes [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=826.0s)]
*  next will seem trivial. First, if you are related to me, I beg you, don't read this. I don't want [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=830.72s)]
*  this- I don't want to carry the shame of what I let happen to me. Be in your minds. Jesus f***. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=834.96s)]
*  This person must have been f***ed. Wow. We're about to read some crazy s***. We're about to [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=840.56s)]
*  read some crazy s*** in this thread. He ends by- You do the same s*** when he needs to waste money [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=844.4s)]
*  on something stupid with the hands in the head for like four days after. I do the same s*** when [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=848.9599999999999s)]
*  he needs to waste money on something stupid. There's been a moment where I've like defended, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=854.88s)]
*  oh, you do the same s*** as my dad when he needs to waste money on something stupid with the hands [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=860.16s)]
*  in the head for like four days after. Okay. Including that Chud did nothing wrong. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=865.28s)]
*  You didn't invite this by lying that you were a year older or anything else. He knew better. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=870.16s)]
*  This is on him. Uh, no. First of all, no one's making you lie about your f***ing age. F*** you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  There is no pressure. There is no f***ing like, man, I was just so pressured to introduce myself [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  to a Discord server and lie that I was- that I was, like, f*** you. Whether you agree with his [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=886.0799999999999s)]
*  conclusion or not, his presentation of the accusations assumed malice from the start. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=890.64s)]
*  Noteworthy here is Destiny's hypothetical about what he actually considers to be a real [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  example of wrongdoing. Does it matter a 30-year-old shouldn't be talking to an [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=900.0s)]
*  age-year-old like- I mean, like, who cares? Like, who are you even to judge this? Who the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=903.36s)]
*  f*** cares that much? Like, if this guy was like trying to like abduct her from like a f***ing high [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=906.48s)]
*  school or some s***, sure- Oh, okay. I'm glad that- I'm glad that Destiny is anti-abduction. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=910.56s)]
*  Got it. Okay. That's a- that's a separate- he has a separate standard, you know, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=917.84s)]
*  leading up to that point is fine. It's just actually when you cross that threshold, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=922.64s)]
*  yeah, someone in the- is only grooming. It was from the grooming region of France. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=926.88s)]
*  You don't understand. You're only a Nazi if you are in the year 1938, okay? And a card-carrying [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=931.6s)]
*  member of the National Socialist Party. And even then you also have to, on top of that, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  say, Heil Hitler. Otherwise, you're not a Nazi at all. And a 30-year-old talking to an 18-year-old [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=944.64s)]
*  is how his last marriage started, so it makes sense. Yeah, that- it's not wrong, I guess. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=951.5999999999999s)]
*  Sure, maybe. But I mean, if you're all in a Discord room, like- [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=957.28s)]
*  I guess technically he's- he's- he's consistent. His moral- his moral systems are intact. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=959.52s)]
*  As long as they're 18-plus, like, are we- [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=966.8s)]
*  Dee did this with the- the exact kind of s*** that three other women, including a former close friend [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=968.88s)]
*  of mine, additional trauma he created was inhumane. What is this? 34-year-old man who [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=972.32s)]
*  cheats on his wife with 19-year-olds on Discord because his wife won't play out of sick fantasies. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=977.84s)]
*  How do you feel about age play stuff? What the f***? Oh, this is- this is him taking credit for [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  the Fox News thing. Proof of age, the person he sent this to. I really don't think she would call [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  you her soulmate and not want you to be with her. Damn, we probably won't talk anymore if you do [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=993.5200000000001s)]
*  get into a relationship with her, lol. I mean, we can talk. It just wouldn't be sexual. You're super [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  young, but you've been a fun person to chat with. Honestly, generally prefer if anyone with 20 [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1001.44s)]
*  messages- if anyone 20 messages me, we don't end up talking for more than a day or two. I'm glad [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1005.36s)]
*  that makes me happy since I've been so stressed. I agitated today. I haven't come at all. Maybe [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  tomorrow I can send you a final big cum shop vid, lol, if I'm not too stressed about the coming day. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1013.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. Wait, what? Oh, if anyone under 20 messages me, we don't end up talking for more [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1020.1600000000001s)]
*  than a day or two. You haven't seen these yet? No. What is age play? Like, with a- with a 19-year-old [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1024.64s)]
*  what is the age play? If the person is under the age of 20 at that point, shit got released [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1031.92s)]
*  a few days ago. How did people have access to these messages? The 19-year-old leaked it? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1037.28s)]
*  What the fuck? Someone said he wants the- he wants the roleplay as her being 75 years old. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1042.48s)]
*  That'd be kind of funny. I'm not gonna lie. I mean, this doesn't seem- this doesn't seem that, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1049.28s)]
*  but I'm imagining a like a discord groomer, cake streamer being like, guys, my kink is age play, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1053.6000000000001s)]
*  and I really need you to call yourself Bertha. Talk about- talk about how your knees ain't what [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1059.44s)]
*  it used to be. I'm Gertrude. Come on, grandma, you gotta take your Alzheimer's medication. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1064.64s)]
*  Oh, oh yeah, take your dentures out before you give me the good suck. Okay, let's get back to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1070.8s)]
*  this video. I'm learning way too much that I did not know about and should have never known. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1077.68s)]
*  What does it matter? This rationale from Destiny makes sense, though, given his history of statements [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1084.3200000000002s)]
*  about his own sexual exchanges. What is this? People keep sending me- okay, this is the- this [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1089.12s)]
*  is- warning, CSAM. Destiny, I shouldn't tell this because I'm gonna get arrested for CPS. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1094.4799999999998s)]
*  We would troll this eight-year-old kid. This kid took off his pants and wiggled his dick on stream. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1099.1999999999998s)]
*  That is- I shouldn't tell this because I'm gonna get fucking arrested. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1103.9199999999998s)]
*  Our child protective services. I used to be part of this horrible thing called the Bro Squad, okay? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1108.56s)]
*  Fucking me, if you remember that fucking Cheeks bitch and fucking a couple other people that [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1114.0s)]
*  have never been on my stream before. We're part of the Bro Squad and what we would do is we would [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1118.8s)]
*  go around JustinTV streams trolling the shit out of these people and we went around from fucking [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1122.72s)]
*  channel to channel like fucking around. Like it was just horrible shit. We went to this channel [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1129.12s)]
*  with this fucking like- this kid was like eight years old and he was fucking bro-ing out with [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  everybody in this chat for fucking reason. This kid decides to take his pants off and fucking wiggle [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1140.56s)]
*  his eight-year-old dick on stream. I can't even believe it. Why is so much of the fucking narrative [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1147.92s)]
*  around being edgy and trolling just like doing straightforward illegal shit? Oh my fucking god. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1154.16s)]
*  It was like I didn't even know like we were on Skype. We were like holy shit. Like we had to do [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1161.52s)]
*  like a double take because we didn't even fucking know like what the fuck was up. Like we were [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1167.68s)]
*  looking at like an eight-year-old dick like on the fucking screen and his fucking brother [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1171.2s)]

*  Squad disbanded after that but I know that I left the Bro Squad after that because the shit that I [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1191.3600000000001s)]
*  saw was just too real. Why is he saying this out loud? This gotta be like at least 10 years old [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1196.0800000000002s)]
*  this clip. He elaborates on what he means by age play here. What? Okay sorry finally awake lol. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1202.48s)]
*  I've had huge fantasies lately related to babysitters either MMF or FFM. It'd go like [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1209.44s)]
*  older babysitter starts messing around with a younger person and they teach them slash get [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1215.2s)]
*  them really good at sex and start bringing over their friends to mess around with them. So say [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1220.48s)]
*  it's a younger guy. Girl finds out finds out he's got a nice dick and starts teaching him how to eat [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1225.2800000000002s)]
*  out and everything then starts bringing over her girlfriends to fuck them one by one. What the fuck? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1231.92s)]
*  This is okay. I'm gonna say judge me by my enemies again on this. Dude I apologize. He explaining his [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1243.92s)]
*  type of women. Wait what? Talk about the fact that you are the cringest gayest fucking retard. First of [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1250.48s)]
*  all we don't say gay here. Okay I've never seen a man's DMs that have made me more uncomfortable [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1257.28s)]
*  in my life than when watching. Jesus Christ. When you try to message e-girls. Okay listen they like the catfaces okay. Can we talk about that for real though? Tyler the creator. No I don't know. Let's go back to it. How old are you? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1261.12s)]
*  Enough to get results. But you're old enough to not text women like you're an eight-year-old horny virgin. It works. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1271.76s)]
*  That's what I'm saying is that maybe you should target other women because the type of women you're [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  targeting where that shit works on is fucking gross. It's people that watch streamers. Exactly stop fucking these type of women. Yeah what should I walk into the professional world and be like hey I'm looking for uh I'd rather fuck the people that like the catfaces [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1280.3999999999999s)]
*  than the people that want the fucking $200,000 watches. Your DMs look like a 17 year old fucking a 16 year old. They work. It's gross. At least the girls that like the catfaces don't have like fake lips and fake tits and fake boobs. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1291.04s)]
*  This is not my type of person. Why? Because I like the like the nerdy college like attitude vibe like anime fucking people. Stop saying words that make them younger and younger. I don't know how you want me to describe it. It's not like you have to specialize in these type of women. You can fly bitches from anywhere. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1303.04s)]
*  Why would I? I just don't want to. I don't vibe with this. Okay. Post a Richard Mill on your Instagram and see what happens. What do you think what happens? I think you get you get scouted by a different uh different breed of woman. What type of woman? Type of women that aren't uh cosplaying as 14 year olds putting on braces. Don't we don't look yet. Jesus Christ. Oh sorry yeah. Who are all these girls? Stop stop stop. You know there's a lot of DMs. Oh Jesus. No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1319.04s)]
*  the DNC not inviting this guy. He's a garment committed defender of the Democratic Party dude like what the fuck. I just don't get it. I don't understand why the DNC is not inviting this guy. All right let's continue with miners. So what is the admitting to jerking off to 15 year olds and what is that? I never admitted to jerking off. I think I just said like this I think the log is something like this 15 year old chick was trying to send me or sending me pictures of herself and she's like let's get back into the video. The video is even worse. That's why it's like really hard to like turn down some of these people. I think. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1349.04s)]
*  She said she was 15 because I shared a picture of a chick that I said look at this hot jail bait. There is no way you just at least he gets pussy on like you. Come on. That's crazy. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1379.04s)]
*  It's me a pedophile. There's a 15 16 year old chicks that like look pretty fucking high like I can't I can't help that like some people mature fucking older when you're a professional gamer there's a lot of fucking girls that are hitting on you. It's insane. And even the scariest part is the underage chicks that hit on you. If you're in your fucking early 20s or some shit and you've got these late fucking teeny bobbers that are sending you you know these crazy pictures and whatnot like not necessarily nude pictures either. I don't to my knowledge I haven't received a nude pictures of an underage person although I guess it's theoretically possible. I don't know. I've never [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1389.44s)]
*  knowingly traded pictures with an underage person consulting some of these logs destiny writes you want to see the sickest shit in the world. So many fangirls. I had one that was 15 dude she's 15 what the fuck. But she sent me pictures. Someone else writes what the fuck. She's huge. Destiny writes back that made it so hard to say no. He shares an image in the chat and then writes I'm going to get arrested one of these MLG's man. I don't know what MLG's means but you know I'm getting the vibe that that would be bad. A friend of his minutes later admits to hooking up with a 17 year old. I don't know [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1419.44s)]
*  how old this person was but based on the context of the conversation I feel like they probably weren't 17. In another log destiny writes I would fuck the shit out of that 15 year old girl what the fuck. He was 26 at this time. So yeah regardless of how you feel about chudlogic's messages the environment in which these allegations were discussed given some of the people involved was nines of responses along with statements like Rob's only further discourages people from speaking out when stuff like this happens. I guess that's a nice transition to the next point [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1449.44s)]
*  which is the topic of aphibophilia. No other makes fun of debate bro logic by using the term aphibiofile. Well it's just inappropriate for me to be flirting with someone who is underage or even young like 18. It's supposed to be half your age plus 7. So yes technically you guys got me. He's not at aphibiofile he's in the aphibiofile. This is a meme it's the debate lord meme that you are differentiating. That definition is straight up dumb. It conflates that being attracted to 15 year olds is the same as being attracted to 19 year olds. Okay so once again I want to retract this accusation. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1479.44s)]
*  I shouldn't have called this guy an aphibiofile either. There's a running joke about how debate lords will make that distinction and how it's weird and I guess now we have some insight as to why they might need to do that. There's a 15 16 year old chicks that like look pretty fucking hot. But in an effort to make fun of that I ended up just unironically doing it myself. I made this distinction when no one involved with the situation ever used it as a defense. What I didn't know about aphibophilia because to be honest I didn't read much beyond the Google search I showed is that the attraction to this a-tribe must [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1509.44s)]
*  be primary. Like he only goes after people in this age range and beyond this one example I have no evidence to support that this is the case. Again I still think the messages were weird and creepy and that the age gap combined with the fact that she was a fan of his does seem a bit predatory but I should be able to say that without calling him these more loaded words. Another issue I do have here though is the implication from Rob that adults can't be groomed. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1539.44s)]
*  Of course adults can be groomed. Categorically denying that this could be a case of grooming because he thought she was an adult is wild. Don't do that. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1570.44s)]
*  Wait a minute. The thumbnail of this video says that stranger danger with my face. He is kind of doing that isn't he? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1581.44s)]
*  I get called a p*** while every other day on my YouTube channel and it's usually because of my mustache and my haircut. You know p*** of stache. It's sort of a classic insult. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1589.44s)]
*  Rob does this thing where he just says something and doesn't give any reasons for why he thinks that. Love that. I also love his characterization of the thumbnail as just being goofy and not that the text above my head says stranger danger and that the person directly to my right or your left is a known sexual harasser and drawn child porn consumer. The obvious implication here is that we are somehow predatory. That's why I compared the two. Seems kind of like a reasonable comparison. I don't know. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1599.44s)]
*  This just proves the dehumanization point I made in my original video. He's got to label him the worst thing ever. No other YouTuber agrees with this take from Noah. Not even Chud Logic's sworn enemies. Xander Hall and Kevles. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1629.44s)]
*  What is this argument dude? What the f***? An endless well of depravity. Just nobody actually agrees with your argument including these other f***ing YouTubers who don't agree with your argument. Those are his sworn enemies. Also Xylothal is a real person which is amazing. Xylothal is the placeholder for like random YouTuber name that I had no idea existed until this very moment until they made like a [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1649.44s)]
*  f***ing hate video on me and it turns out that's a real YouTuber. That's a real guy. Okay. That's fantastic. If you ever catch yourself saying these names think about yourself. Yeah no that's it. Xylothal is a real man. Okay. And he's got he's got opinions and you need to hear those opinions. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1676.44s)]
*  Bandwagon fallacy. Bandwagon fallacy. Bandwagon fallacy. But nah man like I said even though this stuff was really weird I shouldn't have called this dude a pedophile or a nephemophile and I'm sorry to Chud Logic for doing that. I do want to be more responsible and intentional with my words online and this exchange has helped me to recognize that. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1699.44s)]
*  Anyways that's it for today. We will. Jesus Christ dude that is so f***ing nutty. What is this? Even you're loading all of the stuff. When you say he's texting her and he wants to give her dating advice what if she's the one that brought it up first? Should he say something like I'm sorry but it's inappropriate for me to talk to you about high school boys or what like? Yeah yeah yeah you do it all the time when some young person comes up to you and starts saying weird stuff you just sit there with this 13 year old and then you start having conversations extended about them about dating. Yeah I have before. What do you mean? No would I tell a if a if a young person [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1717.44s)]
*  came up to me and they were asking me questions about some like boy problems or some shit? Yeah I'd probably say yeah of course. What do you mean I'm a 35 year old man of course I'm gonna have better advice for them than some f***ing random high school person yeah of course. Wait wait wait okay well then maybe that's just weird behavior even for me that's weird. Okay I think it's I think it's hold on who are they supposed to ask if not adults? What do you mean? If a if a 15 year old girl came up to me and she's like there's some weird shit going on with a boy in my high school and say oh no no don't talk to me honey go ask another 15 year old boy or ask your retarded f***ing mom and dad who are gonna tell you to never talk to anybody's ever? No what the f*** why would you why would I not talk to you in person? Wait what? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1747.44s)]
*  And Destiny if that stuff came out that you were talking to 13 year olds about dating and they came up to you and you're like yeah you know this and this about sex or whatever? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1777.44s)]
*  Why is he getting so mad? He's like no I will. The streamer Axis of Evil? Imagine ever calling someone an a** like sure I may be a pedophile but at least I'm not British. I sexually harassed a girl two years ago there's a video about it on my channel. What? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1783.72s)]
*  I think these guys are all attempting to make jokes well except for Vosh. Vosh was being for real that he did do that and he made a YouTube video about it. What is this? For instance I would not have sex with a Sompiker even if he was a child because he is Turkish. Oh yeah I remember Kevill saying that. That was weird. Listen I don't know what it is and I don't and I also don't want to see this. This is gross but I I will say this I don't know what the f*** vibes I bring to the table but damn near the [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1798.28s)]
*  entirety of my f***ing haters that find themselves in the in the marketplace of f***ing content almost always are either defending groomers are groomers themselves are out at his pedophiles you know what I mean? Defend pedophiles. It's kind of crazy like I don't know what it is but once again as I've always said judge me by my enemies. Okay. If you want to if you've seen a YouTube video that has been out there and it's making you [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1828.28s)]
*  feel some type of way you know where it's just like a sequence of s*** that is clipped out of context most likely coming from this group of individuals. Speaking of Pedogate I'm telling you if you did only less than 1% of all the weird and discussing bad things D did during his online career you would have been already canceled years ago. Yeah I know. I saw clips of you playing some horny ass game. Yes it is true. Yeah every year this meme has to be updated because of more and more Sompiker enemies are out at his predators or their collaborators. Anytime D brings up bro [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1858.28s)]
*  twos we should bring up his bro squad. Yeah yeah my worst my worst s*** is like a satirical an attempt at satire did 11 years ago that is nowhere near as remotely bad as something that I've like owned up to and has informed like my perspective on the world. That's so funny. All right. Let's. Anyway how was working out being going. It's been great. Speaking of speaking of Diddy gate. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1888.28s)]
*  Diddy G. Pedophiles people who collaborate with pedophiles. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETskEkPr6w&t=1918.28s)]
