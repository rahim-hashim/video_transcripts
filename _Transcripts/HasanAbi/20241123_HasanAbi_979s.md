*  one-to-one anyway. But what I was going to say is she was born as an anime cosplay. Yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=6.08s)]
*  An anime character. Yeah. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=13.64s)]
*  Arcane will rip your heart out. I haven't watched the latest arcane yet, but the last three [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=16.6s)]
*  jobs, but I did catch up last night finally. And I'm going to be talking about that folks [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=24.2s)]
*  ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, MBs. It is 11 a.m. exactly on the dot. It's actually [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=29.84s)]
*  10 59 on the dot. I'm live. I'm a song. Pike or this thought that I broadcast go to live [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=35.88s)]
*  from kind of shitty weather, California, Los Angeles folks were alive and alive. And I [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=40.92s)]
*  hope everyone's having a fantastic one. We have, I have so much to talk to you about. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=45.8s)]
*  This is part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news about what's going [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=51.16s)]
*  on in the world of us on outside of the pike room between the time period where it places [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=53.64s)]
*  the stop stream button and press the start streaming button. Okay. That's right. And [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=56.08s)]
*  a lot has occurred in the world of us on house and I be piker. Just kidding. Not really much [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=60.76s)]
*  has happened, but that's neither here nor there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=64.6s)]
*  Okay. First and foremost, let me just get started. I ended the Korean gooner dating [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=68.4s)]
*  stream last night after, you know, seven hours I was tired. I want to hang with the fam and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=73.38s)]
*  I actually caught up on arcane. Finally, I caught up on arcane except three new episodes [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=81.4s)]
*  landed last night. I didn't finish them yet. I didn't watch them because it was way past [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  my bedtime. All I'm going to say is this, all I'm going to say is this. It is incredible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  I don't know spoilers for anybody on arcane overall, but like, I think arcane, I cannot [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=104.64s)]
*  believe I didn't watch the first season when it first came out and everyone was saying [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=110.12s)]
*  it's so sick. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=113.6s)]
*  You lied to your community while you hate us. Wait, what? First of all, I retain the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=114.6s)]
*  right to do whatever the fuck I want when I'm off stream. Okay. That's number one. And [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  number two. Yeah. I wanted to watch arcane. I hung out with, I hung out with little bro [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=124.4s)]
*  but then I watched arcane. Okay. Arcane spoilers, lesbians. Yeah. So that is true. There's a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=129.56s)]
*  lot of lesbian stuff. Lesbians have never had like, this is the greatest. It's the greatest [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=135.72s)]
*  number. It's the greatest amount of, of agitated propaganda that one could do for lesbians. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=143.24s)]
*  Like it's just not lesbians on top. You know what I mean? Like bisexual invisibility, bad [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  year for the bisexuals. Once again, year over year, always a bad year for the bisexuals, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=156.12s)]
*  but lesbians have, have come up so big. Okay. Lesbians have come up so big. Kid fury. They [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=161.96s)]
*  give us 20, give the subs. It is crazy. Okay. Are you by, I am not, which is another L for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=168.44s)]
*  the bisexual world, but woke flicks. Yeah. Netflix is woke. Arcane is incredible. Lesbians [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=175.24s)]
*  on top straight up. Like it's just, it's crazy. It's crazy how much lesbian propaganda is, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=182.2s)]
*  is, you know, embedded into the show, but aside from the lesbian propaganda, okay. Aside [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=188.28s)]
*  from the lesbian propaganda, arcane apparently was like an insane price point. Apparently [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  it costs like like 250 million or something. I don't know. And I really, really, really, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  hope that they complete. They keep doing it. They keep making it. It is incredible. Okay. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=208.6s)]
*  I, when I say this, like, look, listen, listen, there's parts of it that I don't like. Okay. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  There's parts of it that I do not like, for example, the music. Okay. There's a lot of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  like millennial cringe. I think that there's a lot of stuff in it that is very like, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=227.64s)]
*  um, what's that game also with the lesbians, the, the woke game that everybody likes, but, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=233.32s)]
*  you know, uh, what was it with like the suicide and stuff? Not Skyrim life is strange. Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=240.76s)]
*  It's giving life is strange. Okay. There's a lot of stuff in it that is like kind of life is strange [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=247.96s)]
*  vibes. And I don't really like it that much. And in the second season, they try to go a little too [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=254.84s)]
*  artsy fartsy with like, um, you know, when they want to advance the story at certain points and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=260.28s)]
*  they do these like quick musical hits in between. And I'm like, I don't really like that, but it's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=266.2s)]
*  fine outside of that. And outside of the imagine dragons as music, honestly, it is every frame is a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=271.88s)]
*  painting, every frame of painting in this show. You can literally randomly on accident pause the show [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  and it just looks incredible. It looks spectacular. It looks like cinema. Okay. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=287.0s)]
*  The studio has been approved for five more seasons of different storylines. I want to inject it [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=292.84s)]
*  directly into my veins. It is fantastic. Okay. Um, there's a Hassan lookalike contest in LA. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=296.52s)]
*  Please tell me you've seen this. I have not seen it, but each background is hand painted. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=302.36s)]
*  It is so good. It is so spectacular. Did you see the OompaVille Mr. B's interview? Yeah. Um, I'll, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=307.08s)]
*  I saw like people criticizing it, but I'll watch it. Did you cry at any point to be honest? Um, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=312.84s)]
*  not really, but it was, uh, what is this? Was Gallipoli from the Ottoman perspective? Hey, yo, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  okay. This is something I might watch. So all I'm going to say is this, okay. It was so goddamn [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=325.4s)]
*  good. Arcane was so goddamn good. It made me want to potentially consider playing League of Legends. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  Like is, is the early heads of the show? No. Okay. I used to be a MOBA demon. I used to be a MOBA [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=337.0s)]
*  freak in my, in my youth. Like back when you guys were literally protein in your father's nutsack, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=343.88s)]
*  I was out there in the trenches playing Dota. The first ever MOBA created defense of the ancients, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=350.76s)]
*  which was a fan made project off of Warcraft three. Um, that was the OG MOBA. Okay. Ricky [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  Mata was my shit. Okay. And ox butcher ox. Um, you know, try to get that crit, try to get that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=363.64s)]
*  crit going. Anyway, I was a, I was a crit damage player. Anyway, that's not, that's neither here [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=374.2s)]
*  nor there. No, I'm not. I'm that it's fine. Right? I have, uh, I have trapped the old me. I have [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=380.2s)]
*  trapped the old me in the deep dark corners of my mind. I stopped, I stopped playing MOBA games [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=388.44s)]
*  because I was deeply addicted to it and it would do something to me that I did not like. Okay. So [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=396.2s)]
*  I stopped. And then of course, after Dota came Dota two, Han, what is it? Heroes of new earth or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=402.92s)]
*  whatever. Um, and a whole bunch of different, uh, you know, MOBA games came out. And then of course, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=409.48s)]
*  out of all of those, I think, uh, league of legends was the one that, you know, became the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=416.12s)]
*  dominant one. Right. And I know I have a major distaste for mobile games for that reason, for my [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=421.0s)]
*  own personal, my own personal experiences in my life have taught me that I probably shouldn't, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=426.92s)]
*  I probably shouldn't do it. Even though I did post it, arcane is so good. It got me seriously [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=433.16s)]
*  considering playing league 21,000 lines. Don't Sanchez said, don't. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=437.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=446.04s)]
*  Check out Emerald's makeup for her jinx cosplay last night, bro. You ain't no way dog. You did [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=452.92s)]
*  not just link me the vaude. Like that is insane. Chatters are so horny, dude. Hey man. Nice, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=458.76000000000005s)]
*  timestamp, dude. Bro said, Hey, watch this entire eight, nine hour vaude, dude. Check out Emerald's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=468.84s)]
*  cosplay. It's nine hours long. You should watch all of it. Look at Loey bro is really bad, bro. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=477.56s)]
*  All I'm going to say is all I'm going to say, Oh, this is incredible. Holy shit. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=484.28s)]
*  That's weird. What the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=491.64s)]
*  fuck? How does she look exactly like her? That's crazy. Actually, god damn, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=493.4s)]
*  Emerald's so talented. It's crazy. Circus 10 looking ass. Yeah, I got the pants. Okay. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=499.88s)]
*  That is incredible. I guess I will do these. I don't know where they go. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=507.16s)]
*  Her body's literally built like her. Yeah, I guess that's part of the reason. Dude, it's weird. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=512.84s)]
*  How good it is is weird. How good it is. She looks like, like this is a one to one anyway. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=518.52s)]
*  But what I was going to say is she was born as an anime, cosplay, anime character. Yeah. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=527.4799999999999s)]
*  You have to do another cost picture with her. Yeah. I got to do another cost picture with her [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=533.0s)]
*  where she turns me into a, people are saying Jace, but no, I think, I think Warwick before [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=535.88s)]
*  he becomes the beast. What was his name? Vander dude. Vander is the goat. Yeah. I love Vander. So [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=542.84s)]
*  you said no spoilers. That's not a spoiler. Shut up. You don't know anything anyway. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=551.72s)]
*  People that say spoilers are literally aware of what happened in the show and they just want to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=557.32s)]
*  say spoilers. Okay. Listen, listen, listen, listen. You actually fucking spoiled. I'm actually upset. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=561.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay. I'm sorry. So what was I saying? Oh, every frame's a painting. The music leaves much to be [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  desired, but it's okay. I just, I loved, I loved the, I love the show. I like the politics of the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=572.68s)]
*  show too. It's like not, it's not bad. I mean, it's a little, it's at times it feels a little lipped [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=580.28s)]
*  up, but I personally love a good, you know, I personally love a good, is this person evil or [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=586.28s)]
*  are they not evil? Like can't really make up their ambitions really quickly. There's no well-defined [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=594.52s)]
*  boundaries of good and bad. You know what I mean? I like that. I think that's sick. So in any case, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=599.64s)]
*  yeah, not, not the biggest fan of imagine dragons as music, but other than that, it's, it's fantastic. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=607.08s)]
*  Did you say the music is bad? Season was on season one was on point. It's just not for me. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. It's just not for me. Speaking of which, okay. Speaking of good music [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=619.88s)]
*  that I love, okay. I'm not a big fan of the, all the memories, but you know what I am a big fan of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8LysQ-3W0&t=623.88s)]
