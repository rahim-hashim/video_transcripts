*  Nasrallah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  You guys don't understand one Israel has a right to defend itself to Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=10.4s)]
*  It has a right to take over that territory if it chooses to do so in an [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  effort to defend itself. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Yet at this pivotal moment, I want to address you the people of Iran. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  I want to do so directly without filters without this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=29.7s)]
*  Oh, bro, same playbook. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=34.0s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=36.8s)]
*  I love that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=38.9s)]
*  He's mentioning he's talking to the people of Iran in English. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=39.3s)]
*  Oh, I want to free the Palestinian people from Hamas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=41.9s)]
*  I want to free the Lebanese people from Hezbollah and I want to free [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=46.3s)]
*  the Iranian people from Ayatollah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=49.9s)]
*  Where have I heard this before? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=52.4s)]
*  It might as well be the kiss of dog when Israel says, oh, I care about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=55.1s)]
*  the people that means he's going to send some packages. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=58.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=61.8s)]
*  Every day you see a regime that subjugates you make fiery speeches [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=63.0s)]
*  about defending Lebanon defending Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=67.9s)]
*  Yet every day that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=70.7s)]
*  and deeper into war every day. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=75.4s)]
*  Their puppets are eliminated. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=77.9s)]
*  Ask Muhammad, ask Nasrallah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=80.1s)]
*  There is nowhere in the Middle East. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=82.2s)]
*  Israel cannot reach. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=83.9s)]
*  There's nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  with every passing moment. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  The regime is bringing you the noble Persian people closer to the abyss. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn't care a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  wit about them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=100.3s)]
*  If it did care. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  I think what's really funny about this is that like you can make [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  the exact same article example out of Benjamin Netanyahu and the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=106.1s)]
*  and Jews across the world and certainly Jews in Israel too. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=111.0s)]
*  But anyway, this is like telegraphed even from the invocation of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=114.7s)]
*  Persian to the Los Angeles constituency. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=118.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=122.2s)]
*  He is not talking to the Iranians. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=122.8s)]
*  Well, he is he's threatening the Iranians in Iran. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=124.2s)]
*  Just like when he said this about Lebanon, he was threatening [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=127.9s)]
*  the Lebanese population or at least like just telling him like [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=132.1s)]
*  you're going to get that's what it is. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=135.1s)]
*  This is great. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=137.7s)]
*  If it cared about you, it will stop wasting billions of dollars [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=138.5s)]
*  on feudal wars across the Middle East. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=142.6s)]
*  It would start improving your lives. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=145.1s)]
*  Imagine if all it's so funny because it's like again resource [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=147.7s)]
*  resource rich nation and like one of the biggest problems it [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=153.2s)]
*  faces is not necessarily it's like funding of around the region [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=158.2s)]
*  like it's funding of the axis of resistance, but instead [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=162.3s)]
*  unimaginable levels of sanctions that it has to deal with on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=166.2s)]
*  a daily fucking basis. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=168.8s)]
*  Like it's literally Israel and America. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=170.0s)]
*  The vast money the regime wasted on nuclear weapons and foreign [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=172.7s)]
*  wars were invested in your children's education and improving [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=176.0s)]
*  your health care and building your nation's infrastructure [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=180.5s)]
*  water sewage all the other things that you need. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=183.4s)]
*  It's so funny that we're watching this because it is damn [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=186.0s)]
*  near identical to Hitler being like the Hitler doing those [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=189.1s)]
*  speeches. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=194.2s)]
*  Well, I guess like Hitler didn't truly want to you know, get [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=194.7s)]
*  the smoke from England, but remember those Hitler speeches [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=199.6s)]
*  that we were looking at the AI translation or like all the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  misinformation surrounding all of these like Hitler lovers [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=205.5s)]
*  basically lying about his intentions to present him as [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=209.0s)]
*  like a peaceful dove while also simultaneously being like, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=212.6s)]
*  you know, he had to deal with the Jewish problem and it's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=216.2s)]
*  like what the fuck are you saying dog? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  You are literally an anti-Semite. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=219.7s)]
*  Anyway, a lot of those speeches hold great resemblance to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=222.2s)]
*  what Benjamin Netanyahu is saying here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=226.4s)]

*  publicly. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=564.3s)]

*  described is to move Hezbollah back from the border and to do [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=568.6s)]
*  that they seem to be making it clear. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=573.4s)]
*  They don't just intend to do damage to Hezbollah forces along [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=576.8s)]

*  as to whether even if a decision were made by Hezbollah to carry [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=813.2s)]
*  out a sizable retaliation who would make that decision and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=817.0s)]
*  how would they communicate that to field commanders to then [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=821.2s)]
*  carry it out? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=824.6s)]

*  get gifted a sub if you are lucky even Israeli officials [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=857.7s)]

*  capacity. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=862.2s)]
*  Of course, dude. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=862.7s)]
*  And also this doesn't like magically go away people's [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=864.4000000000001s)]
*  resentment towards Israel them and their family members [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=868.1s)]
*  doesn't go away when Hassan Azrala is it's not like the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  guy was single-handedly like brainwashing everyone in [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=873.4000000000001s)]
*  Lebanon into hating Israel. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=878.0s)]
*  Okay, that's why the exact same approach exists in Lebanon [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=880.2s)]
*  as well. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=885.2s)]
*  It you the I have been war. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=886.3s)]
*  Okay, it's not like the Palestinian people are going to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=888.0999999999999s)]
*  be like, oh, I guess it's over now like I guess thank you [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  for humiliating us and subjecting us and us and destroying [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=893.3s)]
*  our lives. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=897.4s)]
*  I now have a totally different analysis of the situation. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=898.5s)]
*  It's like dude, what are you saying people are still going [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  to want to understandably fight back like gutting the command [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=904.5s)]
*  structure of Hezbollah doesn't do anything. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=908.3s)]
*  It just like kind of buys you time for a brief moment. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=910.4s)]
*  But if you immediately go and invade afterwards, you'll see [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=913.2s)]
*  that that command structure is still has a very clear line [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=916.3s)]
*  of succession. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=920.1s)]
*  This is a standing military with a lot of combat experience [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=921.2s)]
*  has below as remaining Arsenal or the threat but the blow [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=924.3s)]
*  that Israel has struck in recent days really raises questions [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=927.9s)]
*  as to what they're capable of it and we should also keep [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=931.2s)]
*  in mind Iran's public comments, which has been to say we're [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=933.2s)]
*  kind of leaving this to Hezbollah to retaliate were effectively [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=937.8s)]
*  sitting this one out not to minimize Iran's own my Lebanese [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=942.1s)]
*  Catholic friend wore black and was mourning Nasrallah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=945.8000000000001s)]
*  So many are pro-resistance even in communities that traditionally [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=948.1s)]
*  weren't of course like dude, of course man, of course like [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=950.6s)]
*  these people understand why Israel has on Nasrallah. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=955.5s)]
*  They didn't has on as all the because he's homophobic or is [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=959.7s)]
*  like domestic politics in Lebanon because he stood as a [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=962.9s)]
*  threat to Israel doing whatever the want in the region anyone [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=967.5s)]
*  who tries to tell you that is different. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=971.6s)]
*  Okay, like there are straight up there are there are Christian [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=973.7s)]
*  Palestinians Christian Lebanese people in this chat that also [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=978.9s)]
*  understand exactly what I'm saying. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=982.2s)]
*  There are Syrians who celebrate of Hasan Nasrallah partially [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=984.0s)]
*  because of the Hezbollah operations in Syria, but also I'm [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=989.7s)]
*  certain that there are Syrians who don't necessarily hate [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=995.2s)]
*  operations, especially against against ISIS style Syrian [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=998.8s)]
*  forces, you know, but none of that matters in this situation. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1004.7s)]
*  What matters is what Israel is doing and what matters is why [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1008.7s)]
*  Israel did what it did. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1012.2s)]
*  They openly stated it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1014.0s)]
*  They were they did not him for any reason other than the fact [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1015.5s)]
*  that he was fighting against and putting a price on Israel's [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1018.0s)]
*  permanent genocide of the Palestinians. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1024.6s)]
*  And if you were to ask those Syrians who are celebrating [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1028.9s)]
*  Hasan Nasrallah, I'm sure many of them would probably tell [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1031.3s)]
*  you that Israel is still a far greater threat unless they're [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1034.3s)]
*  stupid and people can be stupid for the record capabilities, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1038.2s)]
*  but at least from the public messaging standpoint, they seem [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1042.0s)]
*  to be keeping their powder dry as well. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1045.3s)]
*  It is something that absolutely bears watching is Hezbollah [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1047.3s)]
*  on its heels as much as it seems at least from everything [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1050.7s)]
*  we see in here Jim Chudo. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1053.9s)]
*  It's great to have you there as our eyes and ears. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1055.1s)]
*  Thank you so much, Sarah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1057.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1059.3000000000002s)]
*  If Israel attacks Iran would Russia respond? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1060.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1063.6000000000001s)]
*  Yep, Maronite Lebanese here Hezbollah is not without sin [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1064.8000000000002s)]
*  and a street of Syrians horribly. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1067.8000000000002s)]
*  We don't forgive that while simultaneously recognizing Hezbollah [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1069.0s)]
*  is the only thing standing between another occupation in [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1071.7s)]
*  the Lebanese people and know their social economic issues [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1073.6000000000001s)]
*  can be properly dealt with during genocide. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1076.3000000000002s)]
*  Yes, that's like this is something that Americans will never [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1078.3000000000002s)]
*  comprehend because they have been the dominant force in their [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1081.7s)]
*  lifetime and in the lifetimes of their parents and great-grand [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1085.7s)]
*  parents. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1088.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1089.4s)]
*  And even before then they were a settler colony. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1090.8s)]
*  So they were always the dominating force. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1093.7s)]
*  There's only been like 17 years since 1776 were the conflict [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1096.5s)]
*  and sheltered from the impact of said, said active conflict [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1100.7s)]
*  due to his geopolitical placement on the map. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1105.8s)]
*  Okay, it's far away from all of that it deals by nature surrounded [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1110.3s)]
*  by sea. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1114.7s)]
*  So Americans have no way of understanding why people that [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1116.1000000000001s)]
*  that might have differences in opinion in terms of like domestic [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1121.4s)]
*  affairs will harden their position and recognize the true evil [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1126.2s)]
*  or the greater enemy that is destroying them like the three [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  minute ad break that I forgot the run which I'm running right [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1136.2s)]
*  now. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1138.0s)]
*  Okay, the Saan Nazarallah for the same reason that the Ismail [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1138.3s)]
*  Haniyeh. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1140.9s)]
*  I mean the Ismail Haniyeh thing is even worse. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1141.6000000000001s)]
*  Honestly, isn't this just sort of a similar argument that [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1144.2s)]
*  there's no point in taking out Al Qaeda leadership because [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1147.0s)]
*  they would just reconstitute under the cause of hating [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1149.4s)]
*  American imperialism, but Al Qaeda doesn't exist now. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1151.4s)]
*  So dog if you're comparing Al Qaeda to Hezbollah, I don't [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1154.3s)]
*  know what to tell you. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1157.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1158.9s)]
*  It's like thinking that if you American generals that the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1159.5s)]
*  American military is going to cease to exist. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1162.0s)]
*  Okay, that's the better comparison. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1164.3s)]
*  Also Al Qaeda still exists largely as a consequence of our [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1166.6s)]
*  great ally Saudi Arabia consistently using it as a weapon [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1170.2s)]
*  in places like Yemen as a matter of fact. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1173.8s)]
*  So I don't know like whenever people whenever people talk [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  about like Al Qaeda or ISIS and bring these like obvious [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1180.3s)]
*  militant groups that are Salafist in nature or are funded [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1186.3s)]
*  and facilitated and doing so much than destruction to not [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1190.6s)]
*  necessarily America or American interest really but certainly [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1193.6s)]
*  against like America's enemies or whoever America has [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1197.1s)]
*  interest in invading or whatever. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1200.8s)]
*  It's like if you're comparing them to their natural enemies [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1203.0s)]
*  in the region like Hezbollah or Hamas regardless of their [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1206.3s)]
*  different sects because Hamas is Sunni Hezbollah is Shia. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1210.3s)]
*  Okay, but if you are comparing these groups to one another [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1215.4s)]
*  and and pointing to their similarities in any capacity, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1219.4s)]
*  I think you might be a little bit Islamophobic. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1223.4s)]
*  I don't want to say that about you chatter. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1225.9s)]
*  You seem to be at least like somewhat charitable here, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1228.3s)]
*  but the only comparison that you can point to is that they're [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1232.1000000000001s)]
*  just like they kind of look the same I guess from afar because [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1234.9s)]
*  they got big beards and sometimes we're turbines and you [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1238.2s)]
*  know because in in its action. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1240.5s)]
*  Okay, and also direct allegiances. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1244.7s)]
*  Okay, you can say the enemy and my enemy is my friend or [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1248.6000000000001s)]
*  whatever but like in terms of like offering material support [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1251.2s)]
*  Israel has aligned with Isis in the past openly in Syria. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1254.8s)]
*  Okay, Israel has Saudi Arabia another ally of Israel still [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1259.3s)]
*  very much utilizes Al Qaeda in a similar capacity. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1264.6000000000001s)]
*  So the notion that like these guys like Hezbollah like [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1268.4s)]
*  America's enemies are closer to Isis and Al Qaeda is so funny [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1272.3s)]
*  when it's actually America's ally and America itself and [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1276.0s)]
*  it's on material interests aligned with Isis and Al Qaeda [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  in the region Israel also much like Isis desecrates cultural [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1283.0s)]
*  landmarks on a regular basis Israel also uses the shield [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1288.3s)]
*  of religion as a justification for its actions just like Isis [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1293.5s)]
*  does okay and Israel on top of that has directly given weapons [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1297.2s)]
*  to Isis in Syria and has offered medical treatment to Isis [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1301.6s)]
*  in Syria not arguing one way or another just saying they [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1306.5s)]

*  The problem is where do I go? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1758.0s)]
*  You know, where do I go? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1760.3s)]

*  are worsening there in a similar capacity. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1773.3s)]
*  I used it Austria. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1775.3s)]
*  That's a funny time to say that chatter like, oh yeah, I [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1776.2s)]
*  left the American Nazi governance to go directly to [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1779.5s)]
*  Austria, which is trying to do exactly what it did historically [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1783.7s)]
*  not that long ago, not even a hundred years ago. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1788.2s)]

*  That's that's it. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1818.5s)]

*  talks would be successful and the French and the Americans [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=1945.5s)]

*  the decision was made to not do so a because they weren't [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2464.7999999999997s)]

*  worried about Obama was worried about civilian casualties. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2470.7999999999997s)]
*  The Israelis went a different direction. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2474.5s)]
*  Obviously their intelligence was solid. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2476.0s)]
*  But do you think Israel made the right decision doing [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2478.7999999999997s)]
*  it the way they did it again? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2480.8999999999996s)]
*  I think having decimated the command structure of Hezbollah [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2482.2999999999997s)]
*  certainly works to the Israelis advantage. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2486.7999999999997s)]
*  It's actually good for the region good for the world. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2489.3s)]

*  We are continuing to talk to the Israelis about what the [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2497.7000000000003s)]
*  right next steps are and as you rightly said in the [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2500.7000000000003s)]

*  I think it's funny to say Obama cared about civilian [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2507.6000000000004s)]
*  casualties, but in this instance the American foreign [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2510.0s)]
*  policy has gotten more reactionary. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2513.5s)]
*  So I think it's important to make note of that. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2516.0s)]
*  Okay, it's correct. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2518.7999999999997s)]
*  America's foreign policy has gotten significantly worse [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2520.9s)]

*  strikes by Israel no matter how abhorrent the targets if there [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2667.9s)]

*  de-escalation as that State Department spokesman said I [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2680.0s)]
*  think what we would agree on is that there needs to be an [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkOuHh4AjM&t=2682.7999999999997s)]
