# They Used The DC Situation To Silence Us | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk)
*  This is an anti-Semitic act. This was not directional towards people who are people who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=0.0s)]
*  are working for the Israeli government. Now, listen, this is not a defense of the act that took place. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=5.92s)]
*  And I'm actually going to talk about this quite extensively in a moment. Having said that, however, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=12.08s)]
*  having said that, I am stupid enough to dive into that part of the discourse and say, yes, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=17.92s)]
*  this was not an anti-Semitic incident. But the reason why, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=26.4s)]
*  okay. All right. Hold on. All right. So we are, we are going to, before we get to the crypto [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=35.44s)]
*  gala, all this stuff, there are additional updates into the investigation into the killing of the two [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  Israeli embassy staffers. I'm obviously going to talk about this a little bit more today. I covered [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=46.72s)]
*  it extensively yesterday. But this is a perfect situation for those who are pro-Israel, those who [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=51.92s)]
*  are pro-Israel to turn around and reorient the news cycle to a victimhood narrative, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=63.52s)]
*  a victimhood narrative of anti-Semitism. And this will, of course, drive the discourse away from [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=72.24s)]
*  the subject of the Israeli occupying force shooting at Western diplomats, for example, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=82.64s)]
*  or which happened a day prior to the shooting of the two Israeli diplomats, right? Or drive [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  discourse away from the cleansing and the mass starvation that is taking place of the entire [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip. Okay. Matt does a tweet on this. Of course, Matt does, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=110.4s)]
*  and other people, ironically enough, are going to take this position. You know who didn't take this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=116.56s)]
*  position though? I will say this. I will say this. Out of all of the people that rushed to talk about [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=120.88s)]
*  how this was an anti-Semitic incident, okay, this was an anti-Semitic act of terrorism, okay? An [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=128.16s)]
*  anti-Semitic act of terrorism. And it wasn't like directional towards whoever this person perceived [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=137.28s)]
*  as. You know who actually did not say this was an anti-Semitic incident? Wow, I am not seeing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=144.4s)]
*  the name in the chat at all. AOC did. AOC said it was anti-Semitism. Zoran said it was anti-Semitism. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=150.72s)]
*  You know who actually didn't say that it was an act of anti-Semitism? Bernie fucking Sanders. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=158.96s)]
*  Surprisingly, one of the only people in American politics that actually looked at the situation [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  and refused to entertain the notion of anti-Semitism being the primary factor here [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=171.84s)]
*  was Bernie Sanders. He said, I'm appalled by the killing of the two Israeli embassy employees in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=178.88s)]
*  Washington last night and grateful for the quick response from law enforcement. We must all absolutely [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=182.24s)]
*  condemn this heinous act. Violence must have no place in politics. To be fair, he has a bit of an [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=187.44s)]
*  advantage compared to the other two. Yes, megaphonics, by the way, for those of you who [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=194.48s)]
*  don't know who is Jewish, understands the dynamic at play here. This is what all of my anti-Sinist [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=197.84s)]
*  Jewish friends have been warning me about as well, where it's like the knives are out right now. Be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=204.24s)]
*  careful of what you say. The reality of the matter is, if you are, especially if you're Muslim, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=210.8s)]
*  for example, especially if you're an anti-Sinist who is Muslim, you have to play this song and dance [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=215.84s)]
*  and you have to go along with the whims of whatever the mainstream discourse is and you have to say, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=224.4s)]
*  no, this is an anti-Semitic act. This is an anti-Semitic act. This was not directional towards [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=230.32s)]
*  people who are working for the Israeli government. Now, listen, this is not a defense of the act that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=237.28s)]
*  took place. And I'm actually going to talk about this quite extensively in a moment. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=242.88s)]
*  Having said that, however, having said that, I am stupid enough to dive into that part of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=248.0s)]
*  discourse and say, yes, this was not an anti-Semitic incident. But the reason why [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=255.68s)]
*  the Zoroastrians of the world and the Inhan Omar's even resorted to leave, like all these people are [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=263.12s)]
*  saying that it is, is because they don't want to get fucking destroyed. Because people will [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=268.08s)]
*  cynically weaponize this incident to further clamp down on anti-Sinist protest. Big week for [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=276.16s)]
*  anonymous Twitter accounts with 200 followers. Yes. Now it's not apparently Jake Tapper retweeted [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=283.76s)]
*  that clip of you. Yeah. I know Jake hates me. And he does not forget his grudges. So [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=288.56s)]
*  Inanna Rashid didn't say it was anti-Semitic. I thought that they did, but maybe I'm wrong. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=300.4s)]
*  Not that it matters. So this is an act of adventurism. It's vigilante justice. Obviously [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  decentralized violence is no way to truly find justice. Okay. And not only that, but it also [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  obviously creates a hurdle in front of the pro-Palestinian movement. Having said that, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=324.24s)]
*  however, I will never give oxygen to the idiotic posturing. Yeah. Jake Tapper fucking retweeted [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=330.8s)]
*  E.L. Yakoby. Come on, Jake. You're supposed to be a fucking journalist, dude. Are you also that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=339.68s)]
*  stupid? Are you so stupid that you didn't watch the fucking 37 second video? How does he know you? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  I called him a cunt once and he, I don't think ever forgot. Also, I talk shit about him all the time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=353.2s)]
*  Anyway, I do not believe that this is a false flag incident for the record. I will once again [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=357.76s)]
*  reiterate that position that is very clear in the video that Jake Tapper just retweeted, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=367.04s)]
*  despite the fact that the description says that it's not, says the opposite. So where was I? Oh, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  Matt does, by the way, takes this position. Matt does is Bernie Sanders's former foreign policy [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=379.6s)]
*  advisor for the record. Now, yeah, this is who Jake Tapper is retweeting, by the way. I'm not a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  geologist or geographer, but I know there's no shit in Gaza. This is the person that Jake Tapper [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=391.04s)]
*  is retweeting, just so you understand where his, where he's at in his position. But it is expected, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=398.24s)]
*  considering that Jake Tapper is, is, is famously antagonistic to any sort of pro-Palestinian voice [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=404.48s)]
*  or any sort of Muslim really. He is a massive Islamophobic person. Here's another tweet from [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=413.52s)]
*  the person that Jake Tapper just retweeted breaking amid the famine and air quotes in Gaza, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=420.24s)]
*  a brand new ice cream store has opened. Make it make sense from Gaza would the Pollywood saga. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=424.32s)]
*  This is just Holocaust denial shit for the record. Anyone that believes in Gaza would need to be put [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=431.44s)]
*  in a conservatorship. I mean, it's just straightforward genocide denial. So where was I? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  Why am I talking about all this? Because I want to offer a perspective that others are unfamiliar [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  with that actually Jeremy Scahill, who directly interviews leadership within Hamas with regular [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=451.68s)]
*  frequency for drop site news, shouts out the drop site news, actually brought a really good point [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  that sent me down a journey of further investigation. Okay. Jeremy Scale, when [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  talking to Chappo Trap houses, wonderful hosts, Wil Meneker and Felix Biederman said something [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=474.96s)]
*  about Hamas is operational structure and its interests. Hamas understands that operations [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=482.96s)]
*  outside of the boundaries of historic Palestine occupied Palestinian territory [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=492.48s)]
*  will draw will invite a lot of scrutiny to its operations and will only be considered a burden. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=498.88s)]
*  Okay. This is something that is very important. Hamas has never engaged in any acts of violence [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  or any incidents outside of the boundaries of occupied Palestinian territory. They've never [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=515.12s)]
*  done that. And not only that, but what I found to be rather interesting was this. Now, if you recall [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=522.32s)]
*  back in the day Hind Hasan went and interviewed for Vice News Yahya Sinwar. Okay. That one's getting [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=534.72s)]
*  clipped out of context. Yes. Hamas has never operated outside of historic Palestine. Okay. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=544.56s)]
*  They've never engaged in any direct action or violence. And they also urge people not to engage [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  in lone wolf attacks at all. Now people will say, oh, well, they encourage lone wolf attacks in the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  West Bank. Yes. That is occupied Palestinian territory. They did fight ISIS. Nope. They only [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=568.16s)]
*  fight it. They only fought ISIS inside of Gaza. Okay. So you're not wrong. They have fought, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=574.8s)]
*  I almost said fight it. Yes. They have fought against ISIS inside of the Gaza Strip. Hamas has [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=583.12s)]
*  no reason to operate outside of Gaza. They understand the international scrutiny would [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  undermine that call severely. Yes. But not only that, but as you guys might have known already, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=592.24s)]
*  if you've watched my commentary on this stuff before, a lot of the people that are both on the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=597.44s)]
*  militant wing of Hamas, the Al-Qasam Brigades, and also on the civil governance side like Ismail [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=604.08s)]
*  Haniyeh, who was assassinated by Israel, ironically enough, a neutral envoy, a diplomat, assassinated [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  by Israel in Tehran, foreign soil, have time and time again actually released statements, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=615.44s)]
*  released statements about violent acts that have taken place, violent acts that have taken place [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=622.48s)]
*  outside of Palestine. One of those incidents is obviously famously Yahya Sinwar talking about the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=628.96s)]
*  Black Lives Matter protests in the aftermath of the execution of George Floyd. We've covered this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=636.0s)]
*  before. Another thing that I found, however, that I didn't know was when there was an incredibly [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=641.84s)]
*  violent, horrifying domestic terror incident in the Tree of Life synagogue. Did you guys know [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=648.72s)]
*  that Ismail Haniyeh denounced the Pittsburgh shooting on the 28th of October 2018? This is [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  from Times of Israel, so it's written in a very negative way. But the original quote, I went and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=662.32s)]
*  I found the original quote. They said, the Hamas terrorist organization on Sunday condemned the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=668.0s)]
*  weekend massacre at the Pittsburgh synagogue, claiming that as Palestinian victims of Israeli [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=672.0s)]
*  terror, the group relates to the shattered Pennsylvania Jewish community's pain. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=675.04s)]
*  US authorities said that 46 year old, wait, holy shit, wait, so October 7 was done within [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  historic Palestine and Gaza? Yes, of course. What do you mean? Israel is a part of, Israel in its [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=686.0s)]
*  entirety is still a part of historic Palestine. It's occupied territory. Yes. What, what are you [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=692.48s)]
*  talking about? Anyway, listen, US authorities said 46 year old Robert Bowers killed eight men and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=698.4s)]
*  three women inside the Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=704.48s)]
*  police team shot and wounded him. Bowers faces state and federal charges. In a statement, top [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=708.48s)]
*  Hamas official Bassem Naim said the group was sorry to hear about the terror attack. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=713.12s)]
*  As Palestinians and victims of the terror of Israeli occupation, we know the meaning of terror [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=717.44s)]
*  and its horrific outcomes, Naim said. This heinous attack, especially in a place of worship, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  proves that terror has no religion or nationality, he added. And then of course, the rest of it is [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=726.0s)]
*  just like, you know, talking about how Hamas is, is horrible, but not only, not only are they in [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=730.4s)]
*  tune with American politics, not only are they in tune with what's going on in American politics, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=737.92s)]
*  it's actually interesting that like at times they've even released statements denouncing [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitic acts of terror in the United States of America. Can you pull up the BLM one? I mean, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  sure here, Yahya Senwar, Black Lives Matter. Wait, oh shit, the video is deleted. Let me see if I [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  can find it. Hold on. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? I think, okay, this is from Instagram, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=763.28s)]
*  but here is the best I could find. Senwar, Hamas's Politburo had recently killed in battle, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=768.48s)]
*  talked about the interconnectedness of black and Palestinian struggles against racism. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=773.52s)]
*  Oh fuck, I can't see the subtitles, it's too small. It's from the vice interview with Hinn [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=780.48s)]
*  Hassan that you just saw, but I can't fucking zoom in because it's an Instagram post. Let me [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=785.52s)]
*  see if I can find a, no, no, no, the video is not deleted. The video is not deleted here. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=791.6s)]
*  Okay, this is a little bit larger. And I want to take this opportunity, he says. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=797.84s)]
*  Okay, he says, I want to take this opportunity [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=803.68s)]
*  and remember the racist murder of George Floyd. George Floyd was killed [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=808.96s)]
*  as a result of racist ideology held by some people. The same type of racism that killed [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=816.16s)]
*  George Floyd is being used by Israel against the Palestinians in Jerusalem, the Sheikh Jarrah [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  neighborhood, and in the West Bank, and by the burning of our children, and against the Gaza Strip [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=829.52s)]
*  through siege, murder, and starvation. The entire free world must put an end to these crimes. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=836.48s)]
*  The reason why I'm bringing this up is because like they are, the reason why I'm bringing this [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=845.52s)]
*  up is because they are obviously very in tune with American politics and understand these dynamics. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=849.52s)]
*  And it reminded me of, hold on, let me see if I can, it reminded me of, it was on TikTok. I [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  liked it, I think, so I could show it to you guys. It reminded me of the IRA during the troubles, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=866.8s)]
*  releasing statements about American Irish people. Sorry, here's Bernadette Devlin in Boston [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=873.52s)]
*  in 1979. Here's what her statements look like. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  Guys, shut the fuck up. Yes, I know, Radiohead is the worst here because Radiohead is a fucking, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=902.96s)]
*  Radiohead or Zionist, shut up, just listen to the goddamn words that are coming out of Bernadette [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=921.44s)]
*  Devlin's mouth. Oh my fucking Lord. God, some of you guys are exactly the type of fucking annoying [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=926.72s)]
*  little babies that I despise and try to yell at all the time. It's like a different version of being [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=934.32s)]
*  so drama obsessed, okay? It's not the main point. It's not the main point at all, okay? Radiohead [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=940.0s)]
*  being the backdrop of this fucking commentary is not the main point. Listen to her words instead of [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=947.28s)]
*  freaking out. It's like if you saw a can of Coke in the background being like, oh, Coke is BDS, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=955.04s)]
*  shut the fuck up. Shut up. God damn. Gen Z activism is so laser focused on all of the wrong things. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=960.24s)]
*  I think that's part of it too. I mean, if they really understood what was happening in Ireland, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=985.1999999999999s)]
*  they would get themselves sorted out and stand on the right side here because we identify very [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=992.9599999999999s)]
*  closely in our struggle for equality and equality for the right side here. I think that's part of [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=997.5999999999999s)]
*  it too. I mean, if they really understood what was happening in Ireland, they would get themselves [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1004.24s)]
*  sorted out and stand on the right side here because we identify very closely in our struggle for [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1008.0s)]
*  equality and our struggle against oppression. In fact, the whole inspiration of our civil rights [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1014.32s)]
*  movement 10 years ago came from the black movement of America. And it looks to us from where we stand [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  at home that our people are being oppressed with the active assistance of our people. We find that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1025.44s)]
*  very sad. Yeah, this is solidarity of all oppressed peoples all around the planet, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1033.3600000000001s)]
*  okay? This is something that I've seen with my conversations with Irish people [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1040.64s)]
*  that get it. Irish people living in Ireland, of course, including the North of Ireland, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1045.6000000000001s)]
*  not Northern Ireland, but the North of Ireland. And they understand that. They understand that [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1053.2s)]
*  these struggles are almost the same. It might take up different forms. The people holding the gun [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1060.8000000000002s)]
*  might have different interests or rather a different look to them. Having said that, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1069.52s)]
*  the struggle against occupation is always going to look the same. The struggle against white [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  supremacy is always going to look the same. Now, the reason why I'm bringing this up is because [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1080.8s)]
*  there is a part of Jewish history that has often forgotten Jewish resistance to Nazis and Nazi [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1086.24s)]
*  demonstrations and Nazism in general in the lead up to the final solution. And what I find [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1097.36s)]
*  particularly strange is in the aftermath of the shooting that took place, in the aftermath of the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1104.3999999999999s)]
*  shooting that took place from the vigilante justice focused person who, by the way, once again, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1109.6s)]
*  I do not believe vigilante justice is a solution. Okay, I don't believe vigilante justice and [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1118.24s)]
*  adventurism is a real solution to ending the genocide in Gaza, okay, to ending Israel's [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1124.24s)]
*  genocide. Having said that, I find it odd that people who have been using this incident in an [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1133.76s)]
*  effort to clamp down on pro-Palestinian speech to claim things such as free Palestine is the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1143.1200000000001s)]
*  is the modern day equivalent of Heil Hitler, seemingly forget important aspects of Jewish [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1152.64s)]
*  history and Jewish resistance to Nazi Germany. I am reminded of the story of David Frankfurter. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1159.92s)]
*  I'm going to give you two people. I'm going to talk about two people. One is David Frankfurter. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1169.28s)]
*  I'm going to read you a Times article from, I believe like 1939, if I'm not mistaken. It's [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1174.96s)]
*  from 1936, sorry. This is from Time, February 17th, 1936. The title reads, Foreign News, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1183.1200000000001s)]
*  Jew kills Nazi. David Frankfurter, a nervous, hollow-eyed young Jew born in Yugoslavia, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1192.08s)]
*  took the train from Bern last week to the Swiss winter sports resort of Davos. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1198.88s)]
*  He did not go there to ski, and though Davos boasts a fine meteorological observatory, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1204.56s)]
*  he was not interested in the weather. After hanging around town for three days, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1210.24s)]
*  he asked his way to the home of Dr. Wilhelm Gustloff, physicist at the Davos observatory. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1215.04s)]
*  Puzzling Frau Gustloff ushered him into the study. When the doctor rose to greet him, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1222.24s)]
*  David Frankfurter whipped out a pistol, sent five bullets, crashing into his body. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1227.92s)]
*  Wilhelm Gustloff died instantly. Pushing his way out of the house, David Frankfurter walked quietly [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1233.6000000000001s)]
*  across the park and surrendered to the Swiss police. I did it because he was a Nazi agent [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1240.0800000000002s)]
*  who poisoned the atmosphere, explained assassin Frankfurter. These bullets should have hit Hitler. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1245.76s)]
*  Oldest in point of service of all Adolf Hitler's foreign organizers were Wilhelm Gustloff, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1252.72s)]
*  age 41. He was also among the ablest, possibly because he had more than his political beliefs [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1257.12s)]
*  to recommend him to Swiss converts. An able physicist, he went to live in Davos years ago, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1262.56s)]
*  feeling that the altitude would help his weak lungs. Even before his friend Hitler became [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1267.6s)]
*  chancellor, he began organizing Nazi groups in Switzerland. For weeks, Germany has had orders to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1275.36s)]
*  play down all forms of antisemitism in the view of the flood of tourists expected for the winter [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1281.36s)]
*  Olympics. After the murder of Nazi Gustloff here, there was no holding the Nazi press. Roared Julius [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1286.24s)]
*  Strider's Frankishke Tageszeitung. The assassination of Gustloff is another in the long series of [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1292.48s)]
*  Jewish ritual murders which began with the slaughter of the Aryans by Jews thousands of [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1300.32s)]
*  years ago and is now celebrated annually in the feast of Purim. Germany's minister to Switzerland, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1305.2s)]
*  Baron Ernst von Weissacher, on vacation hurried to Berlin for a conference, then back to [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1310.8s)]
*  Bern to make loud protests. Swiss vice president and foreign minister Giuseppe Motta had already [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1316.08s)]
*  sent an official letter of regret to Berlin and the Swiss deemed seemed cool to impassioned demands [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1321.6799999999998s)]
*  by Reichführer Hitler's own news organ for the death sentence for the assassin. Maximum Swiss [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1329.04s)]
*  sentence for political murders is 15 years in jail. The canton for Grisons, where the crime was [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1334.56s)]
*  committed long ago, abolished the death penalty. Thinking of the Olympic Games, Germany dared [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1339.76s)]
*  take no obvious reprisals, but bitter little propaganda minister Goebbels promptly ordered [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1345.6s)]
*  that all Jewish theatrical meetings, concerts, lectures, etc. in Germany be abolished until [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1350.8s)]
*  further notice. Now this is not the only important historical event that took place, okay? This was, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1357.12s)]
*  after all, and David Frankfurter is is hailed understandably as a hero in Israel for the record. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1364.24s)]
*  His story has been talked about in the past. A person who recognized the horrifying nature [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1370.96s)]
*  of Nazi Germany and took matters into his own hands and actually engaged in an adventurous act [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1380.72s)]
*  of violence directed towards someone in a position of prominence for the record, a position of high [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1386.72s)]
*  status. Not simply just like a low level diplomat or low level embassy employee, but a position of [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1393.76s)]
*  a person, a position of prominence. He only served, I believe, nine years of his 15-year sentence or [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1400.72s)]
*  even shorter than that, and he was subsequently released. Okay, here's another story. One who [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1405.44s)]
*  fought back, Herschel Grinspan and the Holocaust. Now this story is lesser known even though it was [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1412.16s)]
*  pivotal. Herschel Grinspan on the morning of November 7th, 1938, a 17-year-old, entered the [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1420.24s)]
*  German embassy in Paris. Hidden within the three-piece suit was a gun he had purchased [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1426.88s)]
*  earlier that day. In his pocket was a postcard on which he had written an abbreviated Hebrew [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1430.64s)]
*  phrase invoking God's help and a message in German for his family. My dear parents, I could not do [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1435.2s)]
*  anything else. May God forgive me. My heart bleeds when I hear of the tragedy that befell you and [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1441.2s)]
*  12,000 other Jews. I need to protest so that the entire world hears this, and this I will do [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  forgive me. At the embassy Grinspan asked to see an official saying he had a document to submit that [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1450.24s)]
*  was too important to be left with the clerk. He was ushered into an office of a junior-level [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1455.28s)]
*  diplomat, 29-year-old Ernst vom Roth, who asked to inspect it. Drawing his gun, Grinspan told him, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1459.0400000000002s)]
*  you are a filthy kraut and in the name of 12,000 persecuted Jews, here is the document. He fired [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1465.68s)]
*  five shots at vom Roth, who died two days later. Now what's important is this was used by the Nazis [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  as the incident that invoked the Kristallnacht. A lot of the important aspects of Jewish resistance [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1480.32s)]
*  against Nazi Germany are oftentimes not talked about, weirdly enough. The point I'm making is not [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  to defend the actions that took place two nights prior. It's not that at all, because as I've said, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1497.84s)]
*  adventurism and decentralized violence such as that, vigilante justice is no real justice at all. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1507.28s)]
*  It is, in many ways, an act of final resistance that people who feel desperate will engage in. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1516.8s)]
*  The reason why it's important to recognize this, the reason why it's important to understand this, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1526.8s)]
*  is because you need to reframe this within the confines of the actual harm that's taking place. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1531.84s)]
*  This is part of the reason why I advocate for real solutions. I advocate for legal solutions. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1538.8799999999999s)]
*  This is the reason why I advocate for real justice, to put an end to the genocide in Gaza, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1548.1599999999999s)]
*  through the legal means that are available. What I fear is that when people recognize that there are [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  no legal avenues available, they turn around and choose to take matters into their own hands. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1564.1599999999999s)]
*  This is something that Felix Biederman was talking about with Jeremy Scale, where he said, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1570.48s)]
*  the social contract that everyone is supposed to abide by recognizes that there is supposed to be [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1576.64s)]
*  a legal means of restitution, a way to take it up to the court structure and have the existing [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1584.56s)]
*  organs of justice, the existing organs of justice that are supposed to bring about some kind of real [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1592.48s)]

*  their powerlessness. This also plays along with what Taylor Lorenz was talking about yesterday in [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1613.92s)]
*  the video that we watched about the someone has to do it meme that has become incredibly popular [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1619.28s)]

*  as is my goal, you have to understand how violent incidents such as this one occur [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1644.48s)]
*  and correctly identify the reasons and recognize whether or not there is a grievance there that [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1649.76s)]
*  broadly would be seen as an important grievance to address. The comparison here is when a, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1659.84s)]
*  I'll give you an example of a person who thinks they're engaging in vigilante justice or vigilante [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1670.32s)]
*  revenge, okay, that does not have a righteous cause. This is identical to what I talked about [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1676.1599999999999s)]
*  with Luigi Mangione as well, yes. However, there are significant differences between this act and [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1684.08s)]
*  Luigi Mangione. I've described it yesterday, but I will re-litigate that in a second. Now, when you [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1689.9199999999998s)]
*  have white supremacist, white nationalist shooters, or anti-Semitic shooters like the Tree of Life [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1695.76s)]
*  Synagogue shooter, the media parses through their manifestos and reveals what their motives are [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1705.12s)]
*  in this process. The reason why they do this is to see what the grievance is. Not all grievances [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1712.8s)]
*  are correct. Some of them are completely fucking imagined. The Tree of Life Synagogue shooter was [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1721.2s)]
*  hopped up on great replacement Nazi theories, the notion, the false notion, the anti-Semitic [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1728.24s)]
*  conspiracy that Jews are importing third world populations into the United States of America and [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1735.44s)]
*  into the Western world in an effort to deliberately undermine Western superiority, okay. This argument [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1742.88s)]
*  is ridiculous. In this circumstance, the initial act of political violence, as Bernie Sanders is [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1749.04s)]
*  correctly called, an act of political violence, which has no place in American society, when Bernie [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1759.04s)]
*  Sanders says that, he's right, okay. This act of political violence was not born out of anti-Semitism. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1765.12s)]
*  And I think considering this as an anti-Semitic incident, or trying to massage the shooter's [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1772.8799999999999s)]
*  motives into fitting in the confines of anti-Semitism, is once again creating this [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1780.56s)]

*  political assassination. Today, Elias Rodriguez is being described by authorities as a terrorist [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1814.24s)]
*  fueled by hate and anti-Semitism, charged with firearms violations and murdering foreign officials. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1821.1200000000001s)]
*  Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated, especially in the nation's capital. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1827.76s)]
*  And we're going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1834.16s)]
*  And we're learning disturbing new details that the suspect had flown into the Washington area [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1839.92s)]
*  on Monday and checked a nine-millimeter handgun in with his luggage. The FBI says he bought a [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1844.64s)]
*  ticket to the event being held at the D.C. Capitol Jewish Museum, his alleged target location. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  It's there, authorities say that he murdered in cold blood 30-year-old Yaron Leshinsky and [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1856.8000000000002s)]
*  his girlfriend, 26-year-old Sarah Milgram, targeting them as they left the celebration [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1862.0s)]
*  of Jewish heritage. He allegedly shot the two members. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1867.28s)]
*  Like even that, this part of it is incorrect. There's plenty of parts of this coverage that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1870.24s)]
*  is just incorrect simply. Okay? Like the event is very clearly defined as a diplomat's gathering, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1875.84s)]
*  okay? Thrown by the American Jewish Committee. Now, the reason why I stress this is because [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1885.44s)]
*  it's called the AJC Access Young Diplomats Reception, because what further investigation [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1892.56s)]
*  has found is that this was an event where young diplomats were supposed to be gathering. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1903.52s)]
*  And while this was haphazardly done by the shooter, his motive was not to go to a place [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1912.8799999999999s)]
*  of Jewish worship and find Jews to kill, but instead try to identify someone who is associated [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1922.16s)]
*  with the state of Israel. This is not a justification of his actions. I am not saying [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1928.96s)]
*  he did the right thing. I'm not saying that I identify with his motives, but it's important [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1935.68s)]
*  to understand his motive. It's important to describe and analyze his motive. Do you understand? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1947.28s)]
*  And I think that there is a reason why this is being presented as an anti-Semitic violent act. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1953.12s)]
*  Because an anti-Semitic violent act and a hate crime is understood by the broader population, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1960.16s)]
*  okay? But the fears I think that people in positions of power, the fears that they have, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1966.72s)]
*  understandable fears that they have, is that if they were to present this as a suspect motivated [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1974.56s)]
*  by taking matters into his own hands because of the sheer inability of the democratic organs of [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1982.0s)]
*  justice taking place to stop the bloodshed that every American has seen, they fear that there [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1990.64s)]
*  would be more copycats. They fear that it would be harder to argue against because of the systematic [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=1997.76s)]
*  problems that I've already described to you about America's attitude towards violence. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2010.16s)]
*  We are in a dangerous place right now in terms of American attitudes towards violence, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2017.28s)]
*  American proclivity towards violence. We no longer have an intolerance to violence [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2025.28s)]
*  in the United States of America. We are no longer as intolerant as we once might have been to [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2032.6399999999999s)]
*  instances of domestic terror even. This is a terrifying prospect. This is a terrifying [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2041.44s)]
*  prospect if you care. Wait, what the fuck? Oh, Ken Klobistine, FBI visits me over the manifesto. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2049.04s)]
*  I guess the FBI came and visited him. We've never had an intolerance to violence. It's just now come [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2054.4s)]
*  home to us as well. Exactly. Members of the Israeli embassy in the back and continued to fire them [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2059.04s)]
*  after they fell to the ground. At least 21 shell casings discovered at the scene. A love story cut [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2064.96s)]
*  short. The Shinsky was planning to propose to Milgram next week. Friends and family describing [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2071.36s)]
*  the couple as lovely people who yearn for peace. Americans were intolerant to violence. That doesn't [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2076.96s)]
*  sound right. I think there was a larger percentage of Americans that were intolerant of violence [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2082.16s)]
*  in terms of like political violence. Do you understand? And now that that number has [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2089.52s)]
*  diminished. Americans have always loved violence. But as far as like political violence goes, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2095.6s)]
*  Americans like order. Political violence is disorder and we are dangerously becoming [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2104.08s)]
*  numb to political violence in general. And this is part of the reason why this is part of the [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2111.76s)]
*  reason why I think the media plays a role in saying like, no, no, no, this is a this is an [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2118.1600000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitic hate crime. Sarah was so empathetic and talking about how the people in Israel are [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2123.28s)]
*  suffering, the Palestinians in Israel are suffering. She was an incredible person [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2130.4s)]
*  and she will be really missed. Yaron was the kind of guy that would have conversations with [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2136.5600000000004s)]
*  anybody about anything. I will forever think of him as a diplomat on par and a peacemaker at heart. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2141.44s)]
*  On Thursday, the FBI was at the suspect's Chicago home continuing its international investigation. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2148.64s)]
*  Looking for it with the city still reeling. The police chief says she has increased security at [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2155.12s)]
*  schools and Jewish community centers. You're also seeing that kind of security across the nation [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2159.28s)]
*  as a result of this truly heartbreaking and cruel story. Michael, that it is Pierre heartbreak, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2163.92s)]
*  get in cool as you said. Thank you for that. The police. Here should share your own tweets. Yeah, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2169.76s)]
*  that's not going to happen, obviously. And it doesn't matter because the only reason why I've [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2174.6400000000003s)]
*  shown the background and, and described certain things about him is not because like the shooter [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2180.7200000000003s)]
*  knew all of that information. I make that very clear in my coverage yesterday. The shooter didn't [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2187.76s)]
*  know any of that. The shooter just assumed that these people would be in some way, shape or form [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2192.7200000000003s)]
*  connected to the Israeli embassy. Okay. He didn't make that calculation as far as we know. We don't [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2198.24s)]
*  know. We don't know. We'll find out there will be an investigation. He's not dead. Okay. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2204.56s)]
*  But the reason why I bring that up is not to offer a post-hoc justifications in the way that like [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2213.12s)]
*  other people do when like police shootings happen or whatever. The reason why, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2221.52s)]
*  um, the reason why I bring that up is because the media also, once again, recognizing how unpopular [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2226.08s)]
*  Israel is in, uh, the, the, uh, broader American population have to present these guys as peaceful [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2232.88s)]
*  doves that actually were working on a solution for Palestinians. And now the FBI is going after [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2241.44s)]
*  Ken Klippenstein for the second time in a year. The FBI came to my home yesterday after I published [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2248.7200000000003s)]
*  the so-called manifesto of the man in charge, man charged with killing two Israeli embassy [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2254.9599999999996s)]
*  staffers in Washington. The visit didn't surprise me, but it's toned it. It was aggressive and [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2258.24s)]
*  threatening. You're not in trouble. The two special agents kept saying good cop style to get me to [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2262.16s)]
*  answer the questions they would later ask where I, where had I gotten the manifesto? Had I, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2266.16s)]
*  did the attack that I receive instructions about how to disseminate the statement? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2270.64s)]
*  Not a single mainstream media outlet has published the text because as they claim the FBI hasn't [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2274.56s)]
*  confirmed as authenticity, but the real reason is simple. The media just doesn't want to publish it [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2278.4799999999996s)]
*  and the FBI doesn't want the media to think it can. You're not in trouble. They said a few more [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2283.12s)]
*  times. I know I replied wondering what else I could say to them to go say to get them to go away. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2287.8399999999997s)]
*  Shutting the door in their faces did not seem wise. Maybe I could demonstrate that I know [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2293.2s)]
*  enough about the FBI that their elicitation techniques wouldn't work. I thought you guys [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2297.12s)]
*  are from the satellite office in Middleton. I asked them alluding to one of their many, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  but little known resident agencies distinct from their field offices, Wisconsin's being in Milwaukee. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2305.44s)]
*  Have you been there? The man asked looking surprised. No, that's where the last visit [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2310.4s)]
*  came from. I explained smiling. The bureau paid me a visit last year about my publication of the [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2314.7200000000003s)]
*  JD Vance dossier. This too seemed to throw them off. They were sent by Washington. They said, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2318.56s)]
*  perhaps trying to distance themselves from the intrusion. Then came the big ask. We want to know [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2325.36s)]
*  about the timeline, how you knew about the manifesto before anyone else. And if you were [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2331.2000000000003s)]
*  in touch with the shooter beforehand, I once again referred them to my attorney and finally they left. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2335.04s)]
*  That wasn't the last I'd hear of them. They left my lawyer, Beth Burden, a career public defender [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2340.8s)]
*  who goes toe to toe with cops every day for her job, support her excellent work, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2345.76s)]
*  hear a voicemail which I've enclosed below. Hi Beth, my name is Ellen Thurmer. I'm a special [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2349.04s)]
*  agent with the FBI Milwaukee Division out of the Madison RA. Calling in regards to your clients, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2354.4s)]
*  Ken Clipperstein. I was just over at Mr. Clippenstein's residence earlier today [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2363.36s)]
*  following up on some questions regarding the manifesto that he published on his blog yesterday. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2370.6400000000003s)]
*  Mr. Clippenstein recommended that we give you a call or email in order to consult with you prior [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2379.36s)]
*  to an interview or in conjunction with you. He was not comfortable speaking to us without your [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2388.32s)]
*  guidance. Again, my name is Ellen Thurmer. I'm with FBI Milwaukee, the Madison RA. I can be reached [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2394.0s)]
*  here at my cell phone. I'll also try to follow up with you via email. It's not a scam chatters. What [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2401.04s)]
*  the fuck are you talking about? As Beth explained to me, special agent LMP Thurmer, one of the two [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2407.2000000000003s)]
*  that visited me told her that they wanted to know why I'd published a manifesto among other [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2411.36s)]
*  questions. Beth called them back and after some back and forth, the special agent offered to send [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2415.04s)]
*  the questions in an email, trying to convince me to submit to an interview as a part of their [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2418.16s)]
*  investigation. The purpose of this interview is to glean as much information regarding the manifesto, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2422.0s)]
*  how it came into Mr. Clippenstein's possession as possible. The email said we would appreciate it [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2426.56s)]
*  if this list of questions was kept between you and your client. The email read these are those 11 [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2432.08s)]
*  questions from the email I've reproduced below. When did he first encounter the manifesto? How [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2437.2s)]
*  did he first encounter the manifesto? Did he receive any instruction from the source of the [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2442.16s)]
*  manifesto about how to disseminate it? Does the system or platform from which he received the [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2445.2s)]
*  manifesto capture metadata concerning the concerning the transfer of the manifesto? Did he make any [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2449.04s)]
*  edits or changes to the manifesto? Was this his first and only interaction with whomever submitted [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2453.8399999999997s)]
*  the manifesto? You want to know something interesting? There was another person who was very quick, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2458.56s)]
*  just like Ken Clippenstein, who also published or re posted the manifesto. His name is Eric Tolar. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2462.96s)]
*  He is a part of the Visual Investigations Unit at the fucking New York Times, because Eric Tolar, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2469.92s)]
*  much like Ken Clippenstein, is a real fucking journalist. The dude published his manifesto on [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2475.44s)]
*  his fucking like Twitter account. What are we talking about? Has anyone else submitted any other [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2480.56s)]
*  documentation regarding this incident? Did his receipt of the manifesto predate the attack? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2485.6800000000003s)]
*  Where else, if anywhere, did he disseminate the manifesto? Does he have any knowledge of [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2490.64s)]
*  where else the manifesto was published or saved? Why does he think he was the one who received the [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2494.96s)]
*  manifesto? That last one is fucking the implication is that that last one is a gotcha for the record, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2499.76s)]
*  because that last one is a hidden premise that he is the one who actually received the manifesto [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2505.36s)]
*  from the shooter. Other than the questions implying the FBI is entertaining an outlandish [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2509.6800000000003s)]
*  theory that I conspire with the shooter, the other seemed pretty straightforward and routine. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2513.6000000000004s)]
*  But there's a Trump administration dimension to all of this. The administration has many times [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2517.28s)]
*  publicly warned about shadowy unseen forces that it believes are bankrolling everything from Tesla [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2521.6800000000003s)]
*  vandalism to the college protests. That tone from the top labeling seemingly everything terrorism [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2526.4s)]
*  tells personnel that the gloves are off and more aggressive work in the field is now permissible. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2532.1600000000003s)]
*  Get ready to hear that I'm impeding the investigation given people a giving people a [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2537.12s)]
*  roadmap to the sources of methods that are used to catch terrorists, or whatever reason the National [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2541.52s)]
*  Security State Sound Board offers up for why the public isn't allowed to know things. Let's see if [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2545.76s)]
*  this gets me another visit. That was Ken Klippenstein. Subscribe to his sub stack to continue supporting [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2550.4s)]
*  good journalism. What is happening? Are you guys duking it out? What manifesto are they referring [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2556.32s)]
*  to? It's the one that the shooter released that was available, I believe on his Twitter account [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2562.7200000000003s)]
*  and his blue sky account. Can't clip is dying. Released the manifesto on his sub stack yesterday. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2568.96s)]
*  I covered it to I covered it yesterday when he released the manifesto to understand the, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2574.88s)]
*  the motives of the suspect. Here is the Israel embassy shooter manifesto, which we covered [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2582.16s)]
*  yesterday. So he did not pay wallet. No, especially at a time when the motives of these actions are [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2589.44s)]
*  very important. And the the media is the media is offering a separate presentation [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2602.7999999999997s)]
*  of the events that unfolded. I'm not shying away from discussing the true motives of this suspect, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2611.8399999999997s)]
*  even if those true motives of the suspect are damaging to what I seek to do, because it would [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2619.2s)]
*  be very easy to simply just go along with this and be like, well, anti semitism has no place, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2630.24s)]
*  like it would just true. It doesn't write and this person was anti semitic. But I think it's [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2634.9599999999996s)]
*  important to make up your own mind and to investigate further and find the truth, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2639.3599999999997s)]
*  especially at a time when narrative overcomes the truth quite frequently. The man shot is a [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2647.2799999999997s)]
*  Christian Zionist is not anti semitic. Yeah, look, that part of it is is not all that important. The [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2653.28s)]
*  only reason why I brought that up is because a lot of news media was immediately reporting on it as [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2661.52s)]
*  though he was Jewish when he is not okay. He was a practicing Christian for the record. One of the [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2666.5600000000004s)]
*  two people that he shot and killed was a practicing Christian that had gone to Jerusalem that actually [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2674.5600000000004s)]
*  volunteered to join the Israeli occupying force that that what do you call it was? I mean, he was [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2681.2s)]
*  yeah, he was a German Christian. His mother was a practicing. His mother is a practicing evangelical [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2689.2799999999997s)]
*  Christian. His father was Jewish, but he himself was a German Christian. He revealed this on numerous [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2695.52s)]
*  instances talked about it. He talked about it numerous times. Okay. Once again, this is not [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2705.84s)]
*  information that the shooter as far as we know, was privy to having said that. Having said that, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2711.84s)]
*  okay. Wait, hold on. I gotta I gotta do something. One second. Yes, I used to know Sarah. She was [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2718.96s)]
*  Jewish. Yes, Sarah is Jewish. Hold on. Hold on one second. I just gotta do this. As you go forward, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2724.32s)]
*  as you go forward with what you have seen, can you give us any sense? Because you said you looked [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2732.08s)]
*  the shooter in the eyes. Can you give us any sense of what you saw in him as he was sort of getting [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2736.08s)]
*  help and people were tending to him as if he too was a victim of seeing this? Yeah, would you be [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2743.04s)]
*  clear? I like heard about that part because we were in a secure room when he initially walked in. I just [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2750.3199999999997s)]
*  saw him screaming and then being handcuffed. But what I saw in his eyes, I mean, I went to [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2754.72s)]
*  Columbia for grad school and I saw the same thing in his eyes as I saw in the eyes of all the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2760.24s)]
*  protesters at Columbia. Nothing different between him and them. But they did not create this horrific [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2764.48s)]
*  shooting. They did not, you know, sort of, they didn't shoot. They created, they gave permission. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2772.08s)]
*  They gave the permission and they have called for this. They have called for Intifada Revolution, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2779.3599999999997s)]
*  which is the same thing he yelled last night. Do you worry that there will be a conflation though [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2784.08s)]
*  of the two, those people who are speaking their mind, who really care about? Yeah, this was, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2791.36s)]
*  this question, okay, which is surprisingly decent. Okay, this question is about how, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2798.0s)]
*  uh, like how in the future the government could potentially fucking prosecute even people saying [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2808.0s)]
*  free Palestine, because it's not a secret. It's not hidden that the administration is, is actively [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2816.16s)]
*  targeting, actively targeting pro Palestinian demonstrators and claiming that they are terrorists [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2824.96s)]
*  or anti-Semitic in an effort to prosecute them in direct violation of the first amendment [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2831.76s)]
*  protections that are offered to every single citizen and non-citizen on US soil. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2837.5200000000004s)]
*  About what is happening in Gaza and those people who are like this person who did this horrific [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2844.0800000000004s)]
*  shooting who intend to do harm. A conflation. I mean, they are calling for Intifada at Columbia. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2850.0800000000004s)]
*  He's literally saying this is the same thing. Like what this shooter did is what these people [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2856.8799999999997s)]
*  are demanding. What free Palestine people are demanding. That is what he's saying. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2862.7999999999997s)]
*  On the university, they call for Intifada constantly. Now they're not quietly. They're [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2866.7999999999997s)]
*  loud. They're loud. You can hear it. They make recordings of themselves. So what's the difference? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2870.8799999999997s)]
*  Are you afraid? Yes. What we're all afraid. All right. Everyone should be afraid. What are you [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2875.6s)]
*  doing to try to make yourself feel safer? Well, can you just go on and live your life? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2880.88s)]
*  I'm a New Yorker. I remember nine 11. You can't let them make you be afraid. You have to go on. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2886.6400000000003s)]
*  You have to live your life and hopefully your government does things to protect you. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2890.8s)]
*  Last night, our government failed us. Jonathan Epstein. I know that they are going forward with [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2895.92s)]
*  this. There's no, I don't think for the record, I don't think that this is once again, I'm going [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2900.56s)]
*  to repeat this even though the dumbest fucking morons that are trying to do Hasbro and trying [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2906.48s)]
*  to do pro-Israel commentary are claiming the opposite. I do not believe that this was a false [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2912.56s)]
*  flag incident. Okay. I don't. I think it's, I think it's, I understand why people do, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2918.8s)]
*  but I think it's unproductive to make speculation such as this. The shooter is not, the shooter is [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2927.68s)]
*  in custody. He is not dead. Okay. The shooter volunteered himself to the authorities. Not [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2934.88s)]
*  everything is a major conspiracy. Can you explain what a false flag is? Yes. A false flag is the [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2941.76s)]
*  idea that like interested parties, environment that actually set up this assassination, like as [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2949.76s)]
*  though, as though like Israel played a role in the killing of these two diplomats, these two staffers [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2961.36s)]
*  in the Israeli embassy in an effort to whip up anger and resentment towards the free Palestine [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2970.8s)]
*  movement. This is what people are saying. Okay. That it's like staged or it's fake. I don't think [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2977.36s)]
*  it is staged or fake. In many false flags, the purpose groomed to carrying out the attack, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2984.32s)]
*  though, I don't think this perpetrator, I mean, there will be a further investigation in this. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2988.96s)]
*  If something smells strange, then maybe I'll change my analysis. But judging by judging by all the [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=2994.0s)]
*  readily available information, I do not believe that this was a, a incident where this, the [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3003.28s)]
*  perpetrator was like manipulated or anything like that. False flag is a deceptive activity carried [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3009.2s)]
*  out during peacetime by individuals or non-governmental organizations. I think Sean the [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3014.08s)]
*  black said it well yesterday, American Israel don't need pretense for escalation against Palestine [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3019.2s)]
*  anymore. This isn't Iraq. America and Israel are so belligerent. They've dropped the need for false [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3023.04s)]
*  flags. I, I don't even disagree. Yeah. I think that's a good take. Yeah. A false, a famous false [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3026.88s)]
*  flag incident was a proposed false flag operation called operation Northwoods, where they were [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3033.68s)]
*  looking for just cause to invade Cuba and what the, what the CIA designed. Okay. Was within the [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3039.52s)]
*  department of defense in the United States government in 1962, the proposal call for CIA [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3048.72s)]
*  operatives to both stage and commit acts of terrorism against American military and civilian [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3052.8s)]
*  targets and blame them on the Cuban government. That is a famous example of a proposed false flag [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3056.32s)]
*  incident that never took place. Another false flag incident is the Gulf of Tonkin incident. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3062.4s)]
*  This was used as a opportunity to, to offer just cause to the United States of America [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3068.64s)]

*  that led to the United States engaging more directly in the Vietnam war. It consisted of [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3083.3599999999997s)]
*  a confrontation when the United forces were carrying out covert amphibious operations [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3086.56s)]
*  close to North Vietnamese territorial waters, which triggered a response from the North Vietnamese [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3090.7999999999997s)]
*  forces. The United States government falsely claimed that a second incident occurred on the [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3095.04s)]
*  4th of August between the North Vietnamese and United States ships in the waters of the Gulf [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3099.92s)]

*  ostensible, but in fact, imaginary incident on August 4th. Later investigation revealed that the [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3107.84s)]
*  second attack never happened. The national security agency and agency of the US department of [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3112.64s)]
*  defense had to create the impression that an attack had been carried out. Claiming that the [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3116.8s)]
*  North Vietnamese forces had actually opened fire. This is what, this is what people think [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3122.0s)]
*  happened. This is what people think took place during the shooting incident yesterday or two [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3128.32s)]
*  days ago. I do not believe that it is a false flag. The reason as to why people think it's a false [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3135.28s)]
*  flag is because of the timing of it, which is one day after the Israeli occupying force opened fire [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3141.36s)]
*  on diplomats in the West Bank that were on an invited trip to the West Bank. And also because [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3149.68s)]
*  Israel's, like people's perception of Israel is more negative than it's ever been throughout [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3163.12s)]
*  the 77 years of Israeli occupation in the United States of America. This would relitigate [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3170.8799999999997s)]
*  this would one perfectly create an environment where the government would have to actively [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3178.72s)]
*  suppress pro-Palestinian speech by tying all pro-Palestinian emancipatory movements [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3185.9199999999996s)]
*  and even the PSL, which the shooter briefly was affiliated with and stopped being affiliated with [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3193.52s)]
*  since 2017 and other legal entities that are allowed to operate under the First Amendment [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3201.2s)]

*  that were created by the Heritage Foundation alongside Project 2025. Project Esther is the [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3217.2799999999997s)]
*  anti-Semitism task force side of Project 2025. It is a written out deliberate attempt of [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3224.88s)]
*  undermining First Amendment protections in this country by tackling pro-Palestinian protesters, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3233.76s)]
*  by claiming that every single person that is aware of the atrocities that Israel commits [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3240.32s)]
*  of the 77 year occupational history of Israel as a violent settler colonial state is actually a part [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3250.72s)]
*  of the Hamas Support Network, HSN for short. Project Esther is open. Like that's not a, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3257.92s)]
*  what I'm saying is not speculation. This is a real document produced by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3266.4s)]
*  And as we know, the Heritage Foundation has produced many documents, this right-wing think tank, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3272.7999999999997s)]
*  that the Trump administration follows to a T. Okay. Why people suspect it is a false flag. I [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3278.08s)]
*  do not believe it's a false flag, but I do believe that both the Israeli government demonstrably and [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3284.64s)]
*  also all of the networks that want to promote Israel or at least shift the attention away from [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3289.92s)]
*  Israel's atrocities in the Gaza Strip are using this as an opportunity to clamp down on pro-Palestinian [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3295.92s)]
*  speech, myself included. There is a reason why there are individuals that directly engage in [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3302.4s)]
*  Hasbra operations, whether it be the ADL or whether it be the likes of dumb fucks like E.L. Yakoby [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3309.6s)]
*  immediately rushed to claim things that I wasn't doing as though I was doing them, including, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3317.2000000000003s)]
*  but not limited to the notion that I considered this to be a false flag operation. You can watch [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3323.52s)]
*  the 37 second video and recognize that I'm actually not saying it's a false flag operation. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3329.76s)]
*  I'm saying the exact opposite. And yet this dumb fuck has now been retweeted by the likes of Jake [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3xMfQGdRk&t=3334.6400000000003s)]
