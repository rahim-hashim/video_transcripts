# Sky News' Yalda Hakim DESTROYS Israeli Envoy's Lies | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To)
*  children, please. I wish we would stop children. This is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=0.0s)]
*  most anti Israel thing anyone can say. It's comical, dude. It's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=5.08s)]
*  comical. You are for no reason whatsoever branding yourself as [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=10.02s)]
*  being pro baby. Okay, what am I supposed to do? What is anyone [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=16.3s)]
*  supposed to do if you call people like listen? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=22.96s)]
*  Here's Morgan says this but is still pro Israel make it make [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=30.92s)]
*  sense. Israel's long since crossed the line of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=34.56s)]
*  proportionate response to October seven and is now engaged in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=37.24s)]
*  deliberately starving guys and civilians relentlessly attacking [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=40.0s)]
*  civilian areas including hospitals and then lying about [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=42.76s)]
*  it. It's shameful and it has to stop. Yeah. Remember when [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=45.24s)]
*  everyone remember when everyone was like Israel gave details as [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=49.64s)]
*  to why they were attacking the hospital that they were [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  attacking and to a surprise to absolutely no one that is aware [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=58.16s)]
*  of what Israel does with regular in frequency. The Gaza hospital [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  attack analysis contradicts Israel's evidence justifying the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=74.32s)]
*  fucking airstrike. Trump leaving tomorrow destination unknown. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  What is ominous dude is JD is JD there or something. What does [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=84.88s)]
*  that mean? Is he anyway? Let's watch incident. It wasn't until [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=88.4s)]
*  footage emerged. Israel continued to deny that these were [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=93.64s)]
*  innocent paramedics. You said that they Hamas militants. It [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=97.88s)]
*  wasn't until footage emerged that Israel then said it would [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=101.48s)]
*  conduct an internal investigation and the findings of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=105.28s)]
*  that investigation has not concluded that these were Hamas [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  militants even though the paramedics say they alerted the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  IDF of who they were in terms of yesterday's attack. I just want [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  to show you some footage that was released by the IDF. Israeli [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=119.48s)]
*  forces say that they were targeting as you say a Hamas [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=122.84s)]
*  command and control center buried underneath the European [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=126.56s)]
*  hospital. You can see what the IDF says are tunnels outlined [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=130.08s)]
*  there in red and this is footage ambassador that the IDF itself [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=135.32s)]
*  has put out now. Sky News has confirmed the footage actually [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=140.88s)]
*  shows the Issan al-Aghar school which is about 160 meters away. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  So this is the courtyard of a school and not in fact the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  command and control center of Hamas. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=154.76s)]
*  So because you sent me that information I checked it without [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=158.32s)]
*  people. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=162.04s)]
*  No, don't don't tell them is the courtyard of a school they're [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  going to strike another school. No. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=166.0s)]
*  The Macy's do you have a playlist as well? Maybe I missed it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=169.92s)]
*  No. If she says bro if she says this is the courtyard of a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  school he's gonna he's gonna invite she's inviting additional [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=179.28s)]
*  bombings. Dude there is never been. Maybe it's because of the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  maybe it's because of the dynamic of this version of the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  Holocaust happening in real time and live streamed in front of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=197.28s)]
*  our eyes. But I've actually never experienced a situation [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=201.8s)]
*  where a country is so consistently so wrong [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=207.28s)]
*  deliberately like so consistently like countries lie. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=215.24s)]
*  Every country lies. We know this every state lies even ones that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=220.28s)]
*  we like like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=223.64s)]
*  Okay. Look I'm fair and balanced. Okay. I call balls and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=226.44s)]
*  strikes. China lies too. And so does the DPRK. Okay. But I've [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=230.6s)]
*  never seen a country like Israel man. I've never seen a nation a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  state that so deliberately and so frequently lies in the most [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  childlike ways possible. It makes no sense like it just is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  gotten to a point where I feel like if Israel is telling me [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=257.88s)]
*  that you know you can go outside and breathe the air it's oxygen [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=262.96s)]
*  I'm gonna not trust it. You know I'm just gonna be like I'm [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=268.08s)]
*  gonna maintain a healthy dose of skepticism here. I think it's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=271.24s)]
*  probably best not to go outside for at least some time. It is so [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=274.2s)]
*  weird man. And also this is by the way the Israeli envoy who [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=280.44s)]
*  very famously came out and got the United Nations to take down [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  children's drawing. He said they were Hamas. There are these [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  artworks is Hamas. The kids are doing the role. Why were the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=296.8s)]
*  kids doing the role? And he successfully got this like peace [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=301.48s)]
*  drawing that was made by like international students at the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=305.56s)]
*  UN headquarters. Why? Because there were drawings where they [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=308.84s)]
*  were saying free Palestine and find peace. Okay. This is that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  guy here. You know what? We got to play it. Danny Dunham. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=320.76s)]
*  The main entrance of the United Nations where thousands of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=324.0s)]
*  people are passing every day. The UN decided to put an [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  exhibition about world peace. Look at the drawings of children [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=331.76s)]
*  from all around the world. Nothing about Israel. Nothing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=335.56s)]
*  about our hostages. Look what they have. They don't recognize [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=339.24s)]
*  they don't. These children don't recognize Israel. We must kill [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  them. Where are these children? I will find them. You must delete [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=352.28s)]
*  these photos and punish the children. They are terror. They [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  are babies of terror. Look at these evil drawings from the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=361.48s)]
*  babies of the world. Promote hate in those drawings. Promote [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  hate. I love the way that the camera pans because he goes look [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  at them. They are promoting hate and it's like peace begins with [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=377.12s)]
*  a smile. Love. No war. Teach peace. This is like the Miss [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=380.56s)]
*  Rachel moment. You know, it's like Zion is getting mad at Miss [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=385.6s)]
*  Rachel and being like, oh, how dare you be so anti Israel? How [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=390.12s)]
*  dare you? Israel number one. Israel number one. No politi [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=394.92s)]
*  here. And it's like why? What are the anti Israel things that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=398.12s)]
*  Miss Rachel is saying? Please don't kill children. Please can [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=401.72s)]
*  we stop children? Please? I wish we would stop children. This [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=406.16s)]
*  is the most anti Israel thing anyone can say. It's comical, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  it's comical. You are for no reason whatsoever branding [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=416.24s)]
*  yourself as being pro baby m***er. Okay? What am I supposed [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=421.44s)]
*  to do? What is anyone supposed to do? If you call people like, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=427.6s)]
*  listen, if out of nowhere in a group of people, somebody says, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=432.24s)]
*  I really hate alia and you get out you get up and volunteer that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  no, actually, it's not you know, it's something that we should be [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=446.44s)]
*  very critical about this kind of statement seems unnecessarily [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=450.0s)]
*  antagonistic towards me, then yeah, everyone's gonna think [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=453.76s)]
*  you're a pedophile. Like what the what is wrong with you? You're [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=457.04s)]
*  the one who adopted this association with alia. Why are [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  you doing this? You know what I mean? Like that makes no sense. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  It's like, people are like, hey, we should give peace a chance. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  In this case, like this is terror. This is terror. This is [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  anti Israel. This is anti Israel. What do you mean peace? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=476.04s)]
*  Israel does not want peace. You are pro peace. You are anti [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  Israel. It's like, okay, well, then you're insane. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  That is shameful. Part of the hypocrisy of the United Nations. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=486.8s)]
*  I demand that the UN will remove the exhibit immediately and will [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=491.76s)]
*  stop with the hypocrisy against Israel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=496.44s)]
*  We must stop this hypocrisy against Israel. Anyway, now that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=499.12s)]
*  you have a better association with Danny Dunham, what is this? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=504.36s)]
*  I'm confused as to what this is. So are you seriously denying [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=509.4s)]
*  that pieces of mass? Wow, it's on I thought better of you. Yeah, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=512.84s)]
*  there no one has done more promo for Hamas than Israel. Like it's [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=515.6s)]
*  so is so funny, where they're constantly like, No, you do not [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=519.12s)]
*  understand Hamas is against us. And they are on the right. They [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=523.24s)]
*  are on the side of not killing children. Like we are on the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=526.72s)]
*  side of getting children. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=530.64s)]
*  Anyone against us is Hamas. Miss Rachel is Hamas. Okay, like [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=533.4s)]
*  what? Yeah, I guess peace is Hamas. All right. Sure. You said [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=539.6s)]
*  it. Unironically have more respect for Hamas and Israel. I [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=544.72s)]
*  mean, yeah, me too. I mean, I've said this already. There is no [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=547.28s)]
*  there is no comparison. Even if you were even if you were to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=551.6s)]
*  neutralize the moral playing field between Hamas and Israel, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=555.0s)]
*  which is ridiculous in and of itself, but even if you were to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=558.48s)]
*  do that, yes, pound for pound Hamas is targeting okay, Hamas [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=562.64s)]
*  is targeting on October 7, which was again, atrocious. Okay, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=568.12s)]
*  absolutely could be considered an act of terror. Given the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=572.96s)]
*  number of civilians that were shot in okay, they were there [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=577.68s)]

*  The world will understand that maybe we can move forward for [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1163.08s)]
*  for something else, but expecting Israel to decide that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1166.6s)]
*  that's it. We forget about the hostages. It's just not going to [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1169.96s)]

*  And it's partially because mainstream media has done a [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1194.3600000000001s)]
*  horrible job by design on covering this issue. But after [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1197.32s)]

*  guys. They kill them like a lot. Actually, if you cared about [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1231.88s)]
*  hostages, I don't think you'd be bombing the fucking hostages. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1235.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, and it's becoming undeniable. I mean, it was [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1239.0s)]
*  undeniable. If you knew enough about Israel's behavior, if you [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1242.8000000000002s)]

*  terrorist organization, I am talking about you, the state of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1257.76s)]
*  Israel as a responsible actor for the last 19 months, the [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1262.08s)]
*  world has been watching the way that you have prosecuted this [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1266.12s)]
*  conflict, the way that aid has been prevented from reaching the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1269.44s)]
*  most needy in the last two months. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1273.48s)]
*  Except Aidan Ross, dude, that's not even true. Even Aidan Ross, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1276.8s)]
*  didn't Aidan Ross recently say no, Aidan Ross is who I'm [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1281.08s)]
*  thinking of when I say even the dumbest guy you know, is like, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1283.8s)]
*  yeah, this is kind of fucked up. Like Aidan Ross, by every [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1286.2s)]
*  metric is perhaps the dumbest guy, like mathematically, the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1289.08s)]
*  dumbest guy you can arrive at. Right. And even Aidan, recently, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1292.68s)]
*  I think came out because I sometimes see his like clip [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1298.2s)]
*  accounts on my fucking timeline. Even he came out and was like, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1300.8s)]
*  Yeah, you know, on God, we got to I just got to say, you know, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1306.08s)]
*  we got to stop all the death in Palestine against Palestinians [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1310.52s)]
*  like, like dudes with fucking negative IQ are just like, yeah, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1314.0s)]
*  the baby murder probably should stop. Like, I think it's really [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1318.2s)]
*  messed up. No shot. He did that. Someone find it. Someone find [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1321.4s)]
*  the fucking clip. Is that because kind of said it? No, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1326.04s)]
*  Aidan. I don't really fucking want to dive into this. My [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1328.8s)]
*  sister currently on birthright and I was hoping it would change [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1332.2s)]
*  her mind. I was really after debriefs with me after but now [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1333.88s)]
*  that hope is fucking on because the Houthi shot a missile at [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1336.4s)]
*  Israel and rushed her and her group into a bomb shelter and [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1338.72s)]
*  made them scared as fuck is so over. Dude, she should have [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1340.72s)]
*  usually tried to stop her from going on birthright honestly. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1343.92s)]
*  But, you know, you you you can change your mind. It's not it's [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1347.08s)]
*  if she's young, if she's young, she's not like as heavily [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1354.72s)]
*  indoctrinated. Aidan Ross speaks about Palestine and Israel war [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1358.0s)]
*  mentioned that he has a friend who's passing and he feels bad [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1360.72s)]
*  for his people. No, this is not what I'm thinking of. No, this [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1362.68s)]
*  is this is not no. He recently said it. He said it recently. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1366.64s)]

*  people are going to be fond of me for saying this shit, but I [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1373.64s)]
*  just don't give a fuck. I do want to. I just don't want to [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1375.2800000000002s)]

*  Yeah. The even the dumbest guy you know is like on God, bro. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1414.48s)]
*  This shit is no cap. Baby murder is not great. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1418.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. I mean, anyway, let's continue. Now that I think about [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1423.8799999999999s)]
*  it, it's kind of fucked up how Aiden wasn't invited to the new [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1427.8799999999999s)]
*  Kanye session slash cuck conversations. Yeah. Because [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1429.6399999999999s)]
*  he's Jewish and Kanye West is a fucking rabbit anti-Semite. And [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1432.24s)]
*  that hasn't stopped Aiden from trying to collaborate with rabbit [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1437.36s)]
*  anti-Semites. He's collaborated with everyone around Kanye West, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1440.24s)]
*  but for Kanye, he's like, no, he doesn't want, I don't think he [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1443.28s)]
*  wants the fuck with Aiden Ross. Cause he's like, he, he just [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1446.9199999999998s)]
*  like genuinely despises Jewish people. Kanye does anyway. Let's [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1451.36s)]
*  continue. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1455.76s)]
*  23 days. We have seen that there have been no, there has been no [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1456.48s)]
*  aid that has entered Gaza. So while you can deflect and say [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1461.04s)]
*  that this is Hamas's responsibility at the end of the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1465.52s)]
*  day, you are the governing power in Gaza. You have a [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1468.6799999999998s)]
*  responsibility to ensure that there is no famine and starvation [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1472.28s)]
*  in Gaza, which is what the world, including your allies and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1475.8s)]
*  partners are now accusing you of. And it's gone beyond the [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1479.0s)]
*  accusation. They are saying that they are seeing it in real time [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1482.52s)]
*  take place. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1486.04s)]
*  So the only starvation in Gaza is starvation of the hostages. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1488.04s)]
*  We have heard the testimony of Aidan Alexander who came out two [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1492.2s)]
*  days ago about the way he was treated in a cage chained by his [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1494.92s)]
*  feet and hands starving to death of the hostages. And it's very [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1499.84s)]
*  simple, you know, you can go on and on and blame Israel for [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1504.44s)]
*  everything, but you have to make it very simple. As long as [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1507.76s)]
*  we have hostages in Gaza, we will not stop. We will bring them [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1511.64s)]
*  back home. They will have adapted from Israel and then we'll [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1516.16s)]
*  come back to Israel. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1519.28s)]
*  Ambassador Danon, I just want to show this Kogat graph from the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1523.28s)]
*  last few months. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1528.2s)]
*  You were really right about the Overton window shifting on [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1529.04s)]
*  Palestine. Previously, we would have never seen this level of [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1531.28s)]
*  pressuring of Israeli officials. Yeah, it is it is truly [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1533.28s)]
*  remarkable. I mean, it took 17 or his 19 months. I don't even [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1537.2s)]
*  fucking know how long it's been. Math is not my strong suit any [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1543.16s)]
*  longer. But after a year and a half, after a year and a half of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1546.48s)]
*  unlimited unrestricted baby murder in fucking broad daylight [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1556.64s)]
*  in real time, a live streamed child Holocaust, there are [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1561.16s)]
*  finally members of the Western press that are going, Okay, well, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1565.96s)]
*  you keep lying to us like we have to actually do our job [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1569.08s)]
*  here. So yes, the Overton window is shifting. And one other thing [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1571.76s)]
*  that I have to mention here is this. We look at polls that come [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1575.44s)]
*  out about the unpopularity of Israel quite frequently. Right? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1579.52s)]
*  We look at the unpopularity of Israel on polls in the United [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1584.68s)]
*  States of America, like the Pew Center, that showed that [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1588.28s)]
*  Israel's popularity or Israel's unfavorability went from being [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1590.8s)]
*  like 20% unfavorable 80% favorable to 53% unfavorable in [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1595.36s)]
*  a matter of two years in a matter of a very short period of [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1600.04s)]

*  the chief of the World Food Programme, just your reaction and [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1871.24s)]
*  response to that, because we can talk about the hostages in a [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1874.56s)]

*  you about the aid and the fact that you are the governing body [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1881.6s)]

*  yesterday, I showed that the Security Council that the IPC [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1895.08s)]

*  because during the ceasefire, we allowed tons of supply to come [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1904.1999999999998s)]

*  Gaza. But if you want to blame somebody, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1911.28s)]
*  Yeah, the famine is in the future. Not now, in the future. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1913.28s)]
*  It's like people are experiencing famine again right [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=1918.0s)]

*  about it is that this is an argument that Israel has applied [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2470.88s)]

*  this? Even though they had literally struck that hospital [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2485.92s)]
*  two days prior to the courtyard explosion. And then they said [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2488.6800000000003s)]
*  it's actually humus. It's a misfired humus rocket. They [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2492.6400000000003s)]
*  killed the Palestinians. And I said the same thing back then I [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2496.6000000000004s)]

*  what the argument was that like, only we get to kill [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2506.8s)]

*  course, they lied about that too. They lied about that as [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2514.04s)]
*  well. They lied about the Al Ahly strike as well over and over [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2517.44s)]
*  again. And the media totally covered those lies as though [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2520.36s)]

*  you are supposed to be a democratic state, a responsible [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2583.6s)]
*  actor, you you are not the same as humus and you shouldn't [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2587.24s)]

*  the one living survivor that offered testimony was 12 year [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2687.2599999999998s)]

*  man. Fuck Israel. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2695.4s)]
*  In this, in this, in my casualties of people who are not [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2697.3199999999997s)]
*  involved with terrorist organizations. But let's [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2700.9199999999996s)]
*  acknowledge it. You know, only yesterday we heard a report about [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2703.6s)]
*  attack of Hamas leadership in Gaza. Why they were hiding in a [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2707.16s)]
*  hospital? Why they were hiding in a tunnel beneath. And I want [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2711.4399999999996s)]
*  to get and I want to get to that incident that took place [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2715.24s)]
*  yesterday. But with this particular incident with the [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2719.64s)]
*  paramedics, it wasn't until footage emerged, Israel continued [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2722.6s)]
*  to deny that these were innocent paramedics. You said that they [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2727.36s)]
*  were in fact, Hamas militants. It wasn't until footage emerged [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2731.44s)]
*  that Israel then said it would conduct an internal [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2736.3199999999997s)]
*  investigation. And the findings of that investigation has not [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2738.8399999999997s)]
*  concluded that these were Hamas militants, even though the [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2742.7599999999998s)]
*  paramedics say they alerted the IDF of who they were. In terms [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2746.12s)]
*  of yesterday's attack, I just want to show you some footage [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2750.48s)]
*  that was released by the IDF. Israeli forces say that they [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2752.76s)]
*  were targeting, as you say, a Hamas command and control center [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2756.68s)]
*  buried underneath the European hospital. You can see what the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2760.28s)]
*  IDF says are tunnels outlined there in red. And this is footage [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2764.04s)]
*  ambassador that the IDF itself has put out now. Sky News has [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2770.6s)]
*  confirmed the footage actually shows the Isan al-Agh school, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2775.2s)]
*  which is about 160 meters away. So this is the courtyard of a [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2779.64s)]
*  school and not in fact, the command and control center of [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2783.7599999999998s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2789.12s)]
*  So you know, because you sent me that information, I checked it [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2790.68s)]
*  with our people on the ground. And what we found out that in [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2793.96s)]
*  this case, yes, you had infrastructure of tunnels [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2797.52s)]
*  beneath the hospital, but it wasn't only beneath the hospital. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2800.8799999999997s)]
*  It was stretched to other areas in that region. And that's why, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2804.52s)]
*  it wasn't only under the hospital. But you should ask [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2808.5600000000004s)]
*  yourself, why under almost every hospital in Gaza, you have a [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2811.5600000000004s)]
*  command center of Hamas? And that's the question we should [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2815.0800000000004s)]
*  ask ourselves. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2818.6400000000003s)]
*  This is the response that they use. Again, another lie. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2821.8s)]
*  Shocking. And they're so bad at this shit, because their [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2826.0s)]
*  propaganda is often unquestioned by Western sources, Western [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2830.7200000000003s)]
*  mainstream sources, that they think they can get away with [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2835.04s)]
*  like lying this much. Okay. And it turns out it wasn't even the [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2838.04s)]
*  right fucking place that they bombed. Like they just use a [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2844.48s)]
*  totally separate, they use a totally separate area. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2847.08s)]
*  I just want to tell you what our experts have told us. Those [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2850.7599999999998s)]
*  tunnels that you're talking about, the dark shapes [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2854.24s)]
*  highlighted there on the screen, the markings were caused by [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2857.08s)]
*  water, not tunnels, because these are drainage systems. And [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2861.12s)]
*  so the dark shades that you're talking about, which Israel [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2865.04s)]
*  claims to be tunnels are in fact caused by water because of a [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2868.4s)]
*  drainage system. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2872.96s)]
*  Well, I'm not familiar with your expert. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2875.04s)]
*  This is what I mean, by the way, if they were doing this since [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2877.3199999999997s)]
*  October 7, because Israel has been lying in this exact same [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2879.16s)]
*  way since October 7, by this point, by this point, the [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2882.4s)]
*  overwhelming majority of Western news watchers would have [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2886.64s)]
*  completely would have been like, No, this is indefensible. They [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2892.92s)]
*  be they be begging for military intervention from a coalition of [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2896.04s)]
*  the willing. Okay, they would have shut off, they would have [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2900.24s)]
*  shut off the money faucet, they would have shut off the weapons [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2903.3199999999997s)]
*  transfers a long ass fucking time ago. Okay, can you imagine? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2906.04s)]
*  And the example I will give you is this. Think about your [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2910.7999999999997s)]
*  perspective after October 7. I was offering this critical lens [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2914.48s)]
*  to the coverage. Think about how much your perspective has shifted [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2918.84s)]
*  in that timeframe. Even those who were seemingly pro [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2923.36s)]
*  Palestinian have learned the true endless well of depravity [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2927.4s)]
*  that is Israeli propaganda. Now imagine if Sky News was doing [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2931.56s)]
*  coverage this critical from the start, imagine if CNN was doing [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2936.2s)]
*  coverage this critical from the start, because for the first [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2939.6s)]
*  year or so, there was never this kind of critical examination [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2942.28s)]
*  ever. Jake Tapper would just sit there and nod as an Israeli [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2946.4s)]
*  military official will say this is why we have to kill the [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2950.8s)]
*  children over and over and over again. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2953.4s)]
*  I can tell you that you're that today in Gaza, you have [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2956.7200000000003s)]
*  underground system bigger than the tube in London and the [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2960.92s)]
*  subway in New York City combined. It's a huge infrastructure of [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2964.2000000000003s)]
*  tunnels, or the dollar that was spent over the years in Gaza, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2968.2400000000002s)]
*  went to the tunnels. And that's unfortunate. And we are [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2972.4s)]
*  determined, it will not be that case. The future of Gaza will be [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2975.4s)]
*  without Hamas. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2979.1600000000003s)]
*  Races, why are you making fun of people's accents? Because they're [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2980.8s)]
*  fucking Nazis. This person is a goddamn Nazi. Okay. And I think [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2983.96s)]
*  it's the it's the least consequential thing I can do. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2989.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, sorry, does that offend your sensibilities? Are [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2992.2400000000002s)]
*  you? Are you sad that I'm making fun of a fucking Nazi? A person [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=2995.48s)]
*  defending the the live streamed Holocaust that his government is [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3000.28s)]

*  some sort of humorous quip in this endless amount of depravity [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3011.36s)]
*  that you're covering. How dare you? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3015.1600000000003s)]
*  And hopefully that the money will be invested in building [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3017.8s)]
*  hospitals and schools and not a network of tunnels. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3020.52s)]
*  Ambassador, so can I confirm that the video that the IDF has [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3023.88s)]
*  put out to say was the European hospital and that there was a [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3027.88s)]
*  tunnel system under there was in fact wrong? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3031.36s)]
*  Absolutely not. I told you earlier, we checked it. And we [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3033.6800000000003s)]
*  saw tunnels that started in the hospital and went to other areas [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3037.28s)]
*  in the surrounding area. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3041.6s)]
*  Do you have some feedback? You got some feedback on this? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3042.52s)]
*  Of the hospital. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3044.84s)]
*  Well, our experts say that this is in fact the courtyard of a [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3045.6400000000003s)]
*  school and not a command and control center. And like I said, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3048.56s)]
*  those tunnels that you point to are in fact the dark marks were [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3052.6800000000003s)]
*  caused by water because of a drainage system. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3056.08s)]
*  So would you say then and admit that this was in fact a mistake by [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3058.7599999999998s)]
*  the IDF? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3063.2799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely not. And I think we would be able to confirm, you know, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3065.16s)]
*  some of the new individuals who were able to eliminate in this [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3068.56s)]
*  operation. And you will ask yourself, it was like a school. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3073.7599999999998s)]
*  Why you have leaders of Hamas terrorist organization hiding [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3077.4s)]
*  beneath a school, beneath a hospital, you know, they're taking [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3081.6s)]
*  advantage of those places, but we are determined to hunt them [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3084.64s)]
*  down. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3088.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry, you're not answering my question, the footage put out [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3089.52s)]
*  by the IDF, they claimed that it was the tunnel and command and [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3094.04s)]
*  control center underneath the European hospital. The footage, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3097.92s)]
*  in fact, is of a school. Did the IDF put out the wrong footage or [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3101.04s)]
*  they got it wrong? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3105.12s)]
*  Yes, I answered you. Maybe you are not happy with the answer I'm [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3106.8399999999997s)]
*  giving you. But it was... [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3109.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the answer is bullshit. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3110.96s)]
*  ...only the hospital itself, the surrounding of the hospital, you [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3112.6s)]
*  have other infrastructure of Hamas, you have tunnels connecting [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3117.2s)]
*  those infrastructure into the hospital. And it's not the first [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3122.08s)]
*  time that we see that the hospital... [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3125.68s)]
*  By the way, the Gaza European Hospital in Hanunis has CCTV [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3127.36s)]
*  footage of the strike. Okay, I'm going to show you just the [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3130.7999999999997s)]
*  moments before the strike. But this is it. This is literally, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3134.2s)]
*  this is the area of impact. Okay, I don't know if I can show [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3139.48s)]
*  you the full footage here. But this is literally the moment [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3144.6000000000004s)]
*  right before impact. This is where they drop bunker buster [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3148.1200000000003s)]
*  bombs on. Okay, even Israeli occupying force stenographer [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3152.0800000000004s)]
*  Emmanuel Fabian acknowledged that the video released by IDF [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_NyVvb4To&t=3156.4s)]
