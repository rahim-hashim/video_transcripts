# Munich Car Ramming: 28 Injured | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4)
*  Ellis Weidel, the chancellor candidate for the far right alternative for Deutschland, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=0.0s)]
*  has insisted that the 24 year old Afghan national detained on suspicion of driving his car into a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=6.32s)]
*  trade union march in Munich on Thursday would have never entered Germany had her party been in power. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=9.92s)]
*  Just after the morning rush hour, central Munich, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  scenes that pour fuel on Germany's political disputes over immigration, with the far right [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=25.6s)]
*  soaring in the polls ahead of the most significant general election since reunification. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=31.36s)]
*  A child's pram and a shoe lie crushed in the street. 28 people rushed to hospital [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=36.96s)]
*  after someone, later confirmed to be a failed Afghan asylum seeker, had rammed his car into a crowd. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  A car crashed into the back of a demonstration. We saw the whole thing. They were walking along [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=50.8s)]
*  the whole street and when they crossed the intersection, a car drove into the back of the crowd. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=58.16s)]
*  As an arrest video emerged, the German chancellor was forced to comment on the divisive issue [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=65.44s)]
*  currently haunting German politics. The alleged attacker, who'd come to Germany as an unaccompanied [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=71.36s)]
*  minor, reportedly had his asylum application rejected nearly a decade ago. So why was he [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=77.44s)]
*  still in the country? This perpetrator cannot count on any leniency. He must be punished and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=84.16s)]
*  he must leave the country. He'd also reportedly been in trouble with the police for drugs and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=91.36s)]
*  theft, but whether he was operating alone or part of a group isn't yet known. At the moment, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=98.64s)]
*  we can neither rule out nor confirm other perpetrators. There are no leads at the moment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=104.96s)]
*  The background is currently being investigated. There have been several lethal attacks by [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  newcomers to Germany in the last few years. Six, it's when a Saudi man drove into a Christmas market [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  in Magdeburg. Okay, the Saudi man was literally an anti-Islam AFD supporter and was not a newcomer to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=122.0s)]
*  Germany. That's crazy. This of course is going to absolutely ignite the same fear-mongering that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=129.52s)]
*  already existed, which is truly beneficial for AFD's purposes in general. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=138.96s)]
*  Controversial policy of remigration is so popular. The AFD leader Alice Weedle, who's been courting [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=159.52s)]
*  support from Hungarian hardline of Viktor Orban, today repeated her Trumpian demands for mass [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=167.44s)]
*  deportations to reverse the immigration started by Angela Merkel in 2015. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=173.68s)]
*  It's crazy because I said this yesterday. Like I just said, everyone in Western Europe has made fun [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  of Viktor Orban. The whole country is going to have little Viktor Orban's prop up left and right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=187.28s)]
*  Terrifying predicament. What should Germans do about the attacks? I mean, it's always the same. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=192.88s)]
*  This is chatter. You address the needs of the population. That's it. Unless you personally, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=200.08s)]
*  unless you're asking that question because you personally think that like there is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=205.12s)]
*  something different to the Islamic style that's taking place or some shit, you know? Contrary to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=209.2s)]
*  the initial information, the suspect had a residence and work permit. This was reported [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=216.8s)]
*  in German media at 817. This deportation agitation in German media was completely off the rails today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=221.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that makes, it makes sense because it, it, it plays a role in, in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=226.8s)]
*  propping up the most like right-wing positions possible. The media loves hitting the panic, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=234.56s)]
*  panic, the panic drums. Social Democrats have failed to fight fascism in many cases helped [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=240.08s)]
*  accelerate it while being the most smug out of touch people on the planet. Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=245.28s)]
*  They are currently polling second, but are unlikely to assume power as Germany's main [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=248.24s)]
*  parties refuse to work with them. Meanwhile, to Munich and to US vice president JD Vance [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=252.96s)]
*  and a multitude of other world leaders for the global security conference on the agenda, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=259.92s)]
*  Russia, the middle East and much more. But today's carnage provokes more immediate questions for it [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=264.96s)]
*  also emerged this afternoon that police had foiled an attempted attack on an asylum shelter [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=271.92s)]
*  near Dresden by someone described as a German national. How will today's events affect the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=278.48s)]
*  election in 10 days time? Hamas says it will move forward with the next hostage release Saturday as [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=284.48s)]
*  part of the ceasefire deal with Israel. This comes as Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=290.56s)]
*  threatening to end the ceasefire if Hamas doesn't free all nine living hostages it agreed to release [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=294.8s)]
*  in phase one of the agreement. Now Hamas says Egyptian and Qatari mediators will work to quote, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=300.08s)]
*  remove obstacles and close gaps to allow the exchange to happen. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  Joins me live from Jerusalem. What's the latest on the ceasefire deal and this pending exchange of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=310.88s)]
*  hostages and Palestinian prisoners and what are these obstacles that still have to be removed? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  Hi Diane. Yeah. Positive signs that this will go ahead as planned. Hamas saying that it is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  committed to implementing the ceasefire deal and will continue releasing the hostages within [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=329.76s)]
*  the agreed time frame. That follows talks in Cairo Hamas and saying that Egyptian and Qatari [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  mediators had decided as you say to remove obstacles to the deal. There was no immediate [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  comment from Israel. Obviously both sides up until now have been accusing each other of violating the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=348.48s)]
*  ceasefire deal and there's a lot of concern from both major stakeholders. This article confirms [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=354.32s)]
*  the misinformation before and explains more. Please read so people know chatter was right. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Summer at the top. Germany Munich car attack injures 30 suspect detained at least 30 people [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=364.24s)]
*  were injured after a car drove into a trade union march in Munich. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=368.8s)]
*  for the suspect and Afghan national legally in Germany to be deported. Police say the suspected [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=373.36s)]
*  perpetrator and Afghan national was detained at the scene. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=379.6s)]
*  for the suspect to be deported. Opposition leader Friedrich Merz said something has to change. The [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=384.16s)]
*  Taliban say they are prepared to cooperate on deportations in return for consular presence in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  Germany. Contrary to earlier reports Bavarian ministers have said that the suspect was not [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=392.8s)]
*  subject to deportation and was in position of a valid residency permit. Weidel says under [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  the AFD the man wouldn't have been here in the first place. Alice Weidel the chancellor candidate [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  for the far right alternative for Deutschland has insisted that the 24 year old Afghan national [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=410.64s)]
*  detained on suspicion of driving his car into a trade union march in Munich on Thursday would [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=417.36s)]
*  have never entered Germany had her party been in power. Weidel placed the blame for the incident [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=421.84s)]
*  at the door of the Bavarian premier Markus Schoder saying the question which politicians need to face [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=426.8s)]
*  especially Schoder is Soder is what was the man even doing here? These guys I think it's so horny [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=433.12s)]
*  anytime like anytime an instance of mass violence occurs they're like oh hell yeah it's time it's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=440.56s)]
*  time to use this as our opportunity. Why didn't the media cover the Swedish mass shooter because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=447.92s)]
*  he was white? The media did cover it the media did cover it but just briefly and unfortunately [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=452.16s)]
*  the reality of the matter is that right wing sentiment is what dominates polite discourse [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=458.88s)]
*  and just discourse in general. Yeah when it's a far right white guy doing an act of then it's like [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=466.16s)]
*  oh it's a lone wolf why are you politicizing this? There's nothing to be said about the right wing [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  radicalization when it's a random Muslim person okay or an Afghan refugee they're like oh this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=477.6s)]
*  is how they all are. Notice that nobody says this is how they all are about white people obviously [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=483.92s)]
*  because that's not the case just like the that's not the case for the millions of Muslim refugees [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=490.16s)]
*  that work and live normal lives in Germany every single day in spite of the anti-Islam sentiment [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=495.44s)]
*  that you hear from many German politicians. The Gazans who have endured more than a year of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=502.32s)]
*  suffering and the hostage fat. Don't spread misinformation there's no known agenda yet. The [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=508.0s)]
*  Doge Ola article is misleading he doesn't have permanent residency in fact his asylum application [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=513.2s)]
*  got rejected at first he had a restricted residency and he was only allowed to stay by [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=516.96s)]
*  formality because they didn't decide whether they will extend his residency. Yeah the Swedish [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=521.2s)]
*  fella disappeared from the news yeah the initial coverage also had like photos of like a random [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=525.5200000000001s)]
*  Arab looking person too and then yeah when they realized the dude was white they were like okay [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=531.2s)]
*  never mind might be sorry about that anyway I'm not saying this is like there is a intrinsic quality [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=537.44s)]
*  to of violence that that only impacts like white people or some shit I'm not saying that at all [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=544.88s)]
*  I'm simply explaining that everyone is capable of violence okay right wingers [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  specifically are very capable of and oftentimes what can you address repeating mass in Germany [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=559.36s)]
*  without calling people racist fascists this is becoming disrespectful for non-immigrants [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=565.2800000000001s)]
*  white people are also humans you know I love that right wingers pretend that the own act of terror [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  is by being Islamophobic like that's your you're making it seem as though if you fucking say [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=575.04s)]
*  you know this is just Islam this is how all Muslims are then you magically solve this fucking problem [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  you're an idiot what are you talking about yes people ask me what do you how do you fix this [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=588.0s)]
*  problem and I tell them it's the same principle all instances of violence like this with the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=593.92s)]
*  exception of like the anti-social personality disorder caused instances of violence are [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=598.88s)]
*  solvable through addressing the material problems that people have okay this is not a unique [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=604.72s)]
*  position this is just the truth that's it also these guys are white people are human too as though [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=611.2s)]
*  I a white man don't think that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjPsHiBMsl4&t=616.88s)]
