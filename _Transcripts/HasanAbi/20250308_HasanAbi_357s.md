**HasanAbi:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc)
*  Joe has everybody on doesn't have Sam on still to this day. 2018 is seven years ago. Yeah. Yep. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=0.0s)]
*  2018 is seven years ago. That's when I started streaming on Twitch. I'm an old man, dude. I'm [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=6.96s)]
*  an old ass man. I have been doing this for a decade plus. I've been doing this for like 12 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=13.92s)]
*  years now. And I started at least like streaming on Twitch with Noah. Ironically enough, who [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=19.84s)]
*  is the most famous person on Twitch? Like he was there's a there's a video of him talking to Sam [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=30.0s)]
*  Harris, who also was a full but all the way back in like 2016, where he had just started. He had [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=36.16s)]
*  just started his his arc. It's like I see a lot of people online talking about this immigrant issue [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=42.56s)]
*  and they either don't have kids. 2018. He's like, he's already started his like right wing arc at [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=48.16s)]
*  this point. But he still has like some of these opinions that he's just like, it's or they don't [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  happen to their kids. Their ideas. Hey, shouldn't fucking come over broke the law. Shouldn't come [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=57.2s)]
*  over here if you didn't want to get your kid separated. If you were in the presence of a woman [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  who came over here from Guatemala and she's poor and she's starving and they're taking her baby [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=68.88s)]
*  away and she's wailing and screaming from a primal a primal place in her her DNA that the one thing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=74.4s)]
*  she loves more than anything is being taken away a baby. Yeah, if you if that doesn't freak you the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=82.0s)]
*  **** out, you're not a part of the team, man. You're missing it. You're missing it. What's what are we [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=87.04s)]
*  here for? We're here for 100 years of whatever. That's what we're here for. If you want to spend [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=91.52s)]
*  100 years saying, hey, she shouldn't have **** broke the law. I don't want you on the team. You're an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=95.76s)]
*  **** hole, right? And I don't give you I don't give a **** if you're right or left. I don't care if [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=100.64s)]
*  you're religious or I don't care if you're an atheist. If that's what you support, you're an **** [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  and we don't want you on our team. Okay, so but if you agree with certain economic problems, bro, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=110.0s)]
*  isn't that crazy? Like who is this guy? Who is this guy, bro? All these that I don't agree with [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=116.16s)]
*  and we could have a discussion about it. We could figure out why you agree and we could figure out [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=121.6s)]
*  why people are allowing all this money to get into politics. Why are we allowing all these special [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=125.36s)]
*  interest groups and lobbyists to interfere with our laws and influence our politicians and create [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=131.04s)]
*  all this **** that we don't want? Well, here's the number. You know what's really funny about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=137.36s)]
*  this, by the way, I'm going to of course being the narcissistic Twitch streamer that I am make this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=141.76s)]
*  about me. I had the same exact opinions back then that I do now, which is why I always laugh when [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=146.48s)]
*  people are like, it's not you're a grifter. You're you've changed. That's why it's hilarious. When [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=152.16s)]
*  you try to pull that **** on me for one reason, you can't just vote online. You can't just vote. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=156.32s)]
*  It's not one person, one vote, right? It's the electoral college and there's a lot of checks and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=161.68s)]
*  balances that are in place. It's all wonderful and groovy, but it's not giving the trust to the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=165.68s)]
*  people, right? Trust to the people that are there informed that they can make their own decisions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=169.52s)]
*  that more people should be able to make the decision. But they're happening now. That 28 [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  year old girl who won in New York, 28 year old democratic socialist, whether I agree with her or [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=177.12s)]
*  not, and I don't know if I do or don't, I bet I agree with her on a lot of things. I think education [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  should be free. I think we should figure out a way if we could pay for bombs, we could pay for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=188.8s)]
*  schools. This I think this idea that everybody should have health care. It's a great idea. Who [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=192.24s)]
*  wants people to not be healthy? Who wants people to be hurt and not be able to fix it? Who wants? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=196.8s)]
*  Are you really saying that struggling people should have to pay exorbitant amounts of money [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=202.08s)]
*  to get fixed when we could maybe chip in and help members of our team? That's stupid. Fill it up, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=206.4s)]
*  figure it out yourself. I had to. You got lucky. You got lucky. You don't have leukemia. You didn't [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=211.68s)]
*  break both your legs when you were 18. Your parents are dead. You got lucky piece of ****. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  These are people on our team. I'm not talking about people who are lazy, good for nothing, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  losers, mooching off the system. You're going to have that too. Well, we got to figure out [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=225.84s)]
*  how to educate people so that that happens less. There you go. That's the little bit [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=229.12s)]
*  slowly creeping in a little bit of right wing reactionary sentiment at the tail end of that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=235.36s)]
*  The mind virus, baby. That's perfectly permissible by the way. But it is slowly, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=239.28s)]
*  but surely it just like takes over your entire mind. That first part, if you're saying that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=245.04s)]
*  about the immigrant children, you're not on the team. I haven't heard anybody put it better. Well, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=251.44s)]
*  yeah. Rest in power to Michael Brooks, by the way. You should just start tweeting this clip [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=257.36s)]
*  out every day. It won't do anything. I mean, but look at this. It's from 2018. Joe has everybody on, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  doesn't have Sam on. Still to this day. 2018 is seven years ago. Yeah. Yep. 2018 is seven years [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=266.96s)]
*  ago. That's when I started streaming on Twitch. I'm an old man, dude. I'm an old ass man. I [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=273.68s)]
*  have been doing this for a decade plus. I've been doing this for like 12 years now. And I started [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=281.6s)]
*  at least like streaming on Twitch with Noah, ironically enough, who at the time was the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=287.44s)]
*  senior editor of Jewish currents and was like working with vice too. And you know, doing vice [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=294.64s)]
*  stuff, all these guys, I would play Fortnite with them. Felix Biederman, Noah Colwin, and now wild. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=300.64s)]
*  That's why those are kind of funny when people are like, when you guys come in here and you're [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=307.44s)]
*  like, Hassan, well, a bunch of your like former co-hosts or whatever have, you know, have, have [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  party. There are people that I met along the way and some of them actually revealed their [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  heinous worldview in the process, but I'm still with the OGs. You know, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=323.36s)]
*  I can think about that. One of the dudes I used to play Fortnite with is my normie friend. That's who [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  I went and saw the Stavros show with last night and my brother. Yeah. I got a lot of, I got a lot of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=337.2s)]
*  day ones. Yeah. I mean that, that actually is basic. Anyway, let's get back to Joe Rogan. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPKX8r3MKVc&t=344.56s)]
