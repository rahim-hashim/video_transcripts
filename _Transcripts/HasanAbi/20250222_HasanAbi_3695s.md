# Trump Is Destroying Everything In His Speech At CPAC | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ)
*  This is one of those things where guys, I think you guys are forgetting that Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump still does have like competent, intelligent people in his orbit. He knows how to repeat [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=4.92s)]
*  certain terms and certain historically accurate statements. It still doesn't change the reality, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=9.64s)]
*  but you know, historically what he's talking about is correct. He's using something that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=17.6s)]
*  is historically accurate to he's using something that is historically accurate or an interpretation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=23.6s)]
*  of history in an effort to turn around and undermine something that has been a time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=29.64s)]
*  Anyway, Obama was downplaying his role. He was saying the team success because there [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=39.96s)]
*  were two seven footers and was taking the sneak dissing and was taking the sneak dissing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=46.2s)]
*  He was getting a little bro by the president and still gave props to MB. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=50.6s)]
*  Huh? Yeah, that's crazy. Anyway, thank you, San Diego. Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  I thought that was you. Thank you very much. Great job. You're doing. And a friend of mine, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=67.8s)]
*  Eduardo Bolsonaro of Brazil, dude, the chamber of deputies. It's really cool that it is virtually [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=73.56s)]
*  all of the worst people on the planet. It's awesome. Like if you're just a bad guy, if you [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  suck, if you're just a bad person who sucks, okay. Donald Trump likes you and you're a part of the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  network. Isn't Bolsonaro going to jail? He's talking about, he's not talking about Javier. I don't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=95.32s)]
*  talk about one of the sons supporters here today. We're going to forge a new and lasting political [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=103.72s)]
*  majority that will drive American politics for generations to come. I think we're going to do [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=111.8s)]
*  fantastically well in the midterms. You know, in theory, the one that wins the Javier, sorry, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=116.36s)]
*  but I think this is going to be a chance to have you. That was a racism moment for me. I apologize. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=123.8s)]
*  A bigger, better, stronger party than ever. I'm sorry. More people in our party than ever before, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=130.84s)]
*  but the people have given us a resounding mandate for dramatic change in Washington. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=136.52s)]
*  We're going to deliver it. We're going to use it and we're going to make America great again [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=143.0s)]
*  by using it. So it's going to be something, but think of it at the presidential level, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=147.56s)]
*  we won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes. We swept all seven swing states, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=152.84s)]
*  Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=159.72s)]
*  All by great margins. We won 85% of all of the counties in America. That means that map was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=167.32s)]
*  red. Did you ever see the map? Did you see the certified map? Where is it? I want to see a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  certified map. Yeah, you want to do something about inflation, Trump. You can't no dude. He's got, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=179.32s)]
*  he's got way more things to tackle. Okay. Inflation, excuse me. That's a patriotic [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=185.72s)]
*  price increase. Okay. What is important is dismantling the federal government. Okay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=192.52s)]
*  So that our corporate oligarchs can make even higher returns on their investment. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=200.6s)]
*  Their quarterly earnings will skyrocket. He has to, he has to make sure that the 10 trans people [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=207.48s)]
*  that are like doing shot put or whatever can no longer participate in any athletic endeavor. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=214.6s)]
*  Okay. That's what, that's what the most significant agenda item is. Okay. For this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=221.24s)]
*  goddamn administration, we want all of the cities and towns along the Texas. That's why I titled [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=227.24s)]
*  today the W's of the burger, right? Because so many W's it's W's galore, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  W's galore. So much is happening. So much winning. You're going to say, Mr. President, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=240.92s)]
*  we never want to win again. I said, Oh, is that good? He said it hasn't happened since reconstruction. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  I said, define reconstruction for me. He said that means essentially the civil war. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=255.72s)]
*  He said define reconstruction for me. I don't know what that is. I don't know what that historical [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=261.0s)]
*  timeframe is. I've just have no understanding. I don't know anything citizens of every race, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=265.4s)]
*  religion, color and creed. And I think one of the main reasons not that we're conservative or not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=270.44s)]
*  that we're anything else. We are the party of common sense. It's about common sense, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  It's all about common sense. Over the past month, we've confirmed an all star team of warriors, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=285.08s)]
*  patriots, visionaries and put the America first agenda into action. I see Doug Burgum sitting [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=291.48s)]
*  right over there. He was so good. I looked at him. I said, I got to have him here. I got to have him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=297.48s)]
*  He's you know, he was a great he was a great governor. He's involved with little thing called [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  energy. He's got the Department of Interior and Chris Wright has the Department of Energy. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=307.72s)]
*  So Chris has no energy and Doug has all of the energy. Chris has more interior, but he doesn't [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  so I merged them. So now you have an energy guy and you have the guy with all the energy [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=320.28s)]
*  and you're going to drill baby drill. Aren't you? Huh? Drill baby drill. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=326.44s)]
*  And Catherine stand up. His wife is incredible. She is such an incredible woman. Incredible woman. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=334.12s)]
*  You got very lucky, Doug. It's good to be successful, isn't it? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  She's an incredible woman. He's an incredible guy. In addition to the great [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  cabinet secretaries we have here today, we confirmed Secretary of Defense Pete Hagseth [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=355.4s)]
*  to end the Woken Sanity and rebuild our military. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=361.32s)]
*  He is fantastic. Thank you. To stop the weaponization of federal law enforcement. I [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=366.12s)]
*  know about that. I think better than any human being on earth. This week, we swore in a new [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  director of the FBI, somebody that everybody wanted cash. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=378.36s)]
*  Dude, Cash Patel is such a funny person to put in charge of the FBI. Just a truly insane guy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=387.32s)]
*  I haven't even fully talked about the cash, but they'll stuff because like the vibes are so fucked. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=395.32s)]
*  The optics are so bad, just legitimately an insane person to put in charge of the FBI. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=402.36s)]
*  I don't know where we're going in this next, in this next chapter of the American empire's, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=410.36s)]
*  American empire's final chapter is going to be an objectively weird one. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=418.36s)]
*  Human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He's a published children's book author. I know. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=421.56s)]
*  And he also has the worst merge of all time and literally a QAnon guy. I cannot comprehend how [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=427.4s)]
*  we got to a point where unironically a 4chan op, okay. Just a totally made up 4chan thing broke [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  the minds of enough boomers in the Republican base that now you got loyal supporters of this insanity [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  of Bobby leading the FBI. Fantastic stuff. Let's see where we go from here. It's one and 30. Oh, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=451.16s)]
*  he's doing, oh, he's doing autism vaccines. Make, make children autistic. There's something wrong. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=459.0s)]
*  Something's wrong. And Bobby is going to find it working with Dr. Oz by the way, working with Dr. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  Oz. Together we've achieved more in four weeks than most administrations achieve in four years. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=481.16s)]
*  We may, we made a lot of progress. I heard O'Reilly last night say Donald Trump for the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=485.8s)]
*  first four weeks is the greatest president ever in the history of our country. That was O'Reilly. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=491.24s)]
*  Bill O'Reilly is all right. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  You know who he said second was? George Washington. That's not bad. I beat George Washington. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=503.0s)]
*  I love beating George Washington. Thank you, Bill. On our first day in office, we declared [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=508.84s)]
*  a national emergency at our southern border. After years of politicians using our military to defend [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=515.4s)]
*  foreign borders while leaving our country defenseless and helpless, we deployed, we deployed a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=522.76s)]
*  group of people, active duty troops to defend our border and repel the invasion of our country. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=529.4s)]
*  This was an invasion. You know, we had a great first term, a really great first term, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=535.24s)]
*  and I called it an invasion. And we had great numbers, but now we have the best numbers we've [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=540.84s)]
*  ever had. We've never had numbers like this. We've done it all in four weeks. Think of it. That was [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=545.48s)]
*  Tom Homan, Kristi Noem, the whole group. When day one I ended the catch and release, I reinstated, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=550.92s)]
*  remain in Mexico when I signed an order that will end birthright citizenship for the children of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=557.88s)]
*  illegal aliens. Because it wasn't meant for these children. It wasn't meant for people that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=563.88s)]
*  escaped or invaded, came into our country illegally. It was meant for the children of slaves. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=574.84s)]
*  Because when it was done many, many years ago, it was during a very tough period in this country's [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=582.2s)]
*  history. And that was meant for the children of slaves. I wish people would understand that so [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=589.64s)]
*  they could get this thing approved. And we don't have millions and millions of people coming into [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=595.0s)]
*  our country and they shouldn't be here. This week I also canceled temporary protected status [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=600.92s)]
*  for migrants from Haiti. Um, fact check, please. No, he's not wrong. I mean, he's not wrong. He's [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=609.08s)]
*  not wrong. This is one of those things where guys, I think you guys are forgetting that Donald Trump [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=616.04s)]
*  still does have like competent, intelligent people in his orbit. He knows how to repeat certain terms [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=621.72s)]
*  and certain historically accurate statements. It still doesn't change the reality, but you know, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=627.32s)]
*  historically what he's talking about is correct. He's using something that is historically accurate [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=635.5600000000001s)]
*  to he's using something that is historically accurate or an interpretation of history in an [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  effort to turn around and undermine something that has been a time and time again, defended [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=647.32s)]
*  in terms of it's a, it's, it's, I guess I was about to use the term super precedent, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=654.44s)]
*  but it doesn't really matter anymore. Cause so was Roe v. Wade. I'll bet nobody knows her last [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=660.12s)]
*  night. Nobody ever knows her last name. Even during the campaign, you'd have to say Kamala. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=665.08s)]
*  It's strange, you know, a little different name. Kamala. Yeah. Also destroying birthright is not [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=670.6s)]
*  appropriate in any way, shape or form. It's like one of the only good things about this goddamn [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=676.76s)]
*  country. God, we're destroying everything that is good. And what, whatever remains about the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=681.24s)]
*  United States of America, that was kind of good. We're just going to dismantle. What's next. You [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=686.0400000000001s)]
*  have the right to retain a lawyer gone. Okay. We beat to we, I didn't beat you. Literally like, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=691.32s)]
*  there are very few things. There are very few things that make America stand out. Okay. And, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=697.8s)]
*  and on ironically are good. You finally admitted there's something good about America. If you've [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=708.1999999999999s)]
*  been in here long enough, you've heard me say this all the time. I think freedom of speech and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  freedom of press is good. Okay. In both principle, not unfortunately in its application in America, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=717.4s)]
*  it's always been one sided, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Okay. It's a good thing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=723.32s)]
*  Same goes for the right to, to be able to retain an attorney no matter what. And that the state can [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=728.36s)]
*  provide you one. If you don't have the finance to be able to retain an attorney on your own, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=735.08s)]
*  that's a good thing. Okay. Like due process. Good. Very good. Cutie said pack gloves, pack a hat and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=739.8000000000001s)]
*  gloves. She wants to fill in the pot outside. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. I got it. They aren't [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=749.16s)]
*  even specific to America, just general liberal principles that are widely accepted across the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=754.52s)]

*  It's like America's interpretation of immigrants, like understanding that we are a nation of [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=770.04s)]
*  immigrants is literally one of the best aspects that is straightforwardly one of the best parts [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=776.84s)]

*  a little bit on the slightly left of center. And everybody said, why did I do that? I said, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=798.9200000000001s)]
*  you know why I did that? Because unions like her and labor likes her and a lot of people like her [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=805.0s)]

*  we got the auto workers were so great. We had tremendous support. So I think it's nice to give [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=820.2s)]

*  of people say, why do you do that? I said, because they want to do something nice for these people [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=833.32s)]
*  that voted for me. Oh gee, what a great political move that was. Now they're all say, what a great [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=837.6400000000001s)]
*  political move. Now it's just, it's all common sense. Remember that. Remember that Sean O'Brien [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=843.32s)]
*  was fantastic for the birthright citizenship to be removed. The Supreme court would have the rule [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=849.5600000000001s)]

*  We're going to have a great country again. It's going to happen soon, a lot sooner than you think. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=970.52s)]
*  And we're going to have so much money coming in from tariffs. Oh, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=974.84s)]
*  you're going to say your senators and your congressmen are going to say, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=979.24s)]
*  please, sir, please, you're making us look so bad. We have so much money coming in. I didn't know [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=982.92s)]
*  this was going to happen. Please don't do this to us. We look very bad, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=989.0799999999999s)]

*  they're sticking together. The republics, the Republican congressmen and women are sticking together. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=997.88s)]
*  Every once in a while, you have one that wants a little action or something. I don't know what it is. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1003.32s)]
*  It's so sad to see. I just hate to see it. I hate to see it, but they're sticking together. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1009.1600000000001s)]
*  One thing about the Democrats, they have rotten, horrible policy, the worst policy in history, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1016.44s)]
*  but they stick together. We have great policy, but sometimes they don't stick, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1022.84s)]
*  but they've been sticking for us. They've been sticking. And I think that's the only thing [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1027.0s)]
*  that's been sticking for us. They've been sticking. And I think the speaker and the leader have done a fantastic job. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1031.24s)]
*  That's Thune and Johnson. And I think they've done two guys really working hard and doing it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1037.0s)]
*  They're really doing a great job, but we have a lot to stick with. We have a lot to stick together [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  for because what we've done has never been done before. Nobody's ever seen anything like this, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1048.9199999999998s)]
*  and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we've had, especially the four weeks, the first four weeks. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  That's like if you golf, when you sink that first four footer in the first hole, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1059.6399999999999s)]
*  it gives you confidence. And the next show, you sink another one. Now you go into that third hole, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1064.6799999999998s)]
*  and by the time you get to the fifth hole, you feel you can't miss. Like a baseball player, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1069.08s)]
*  he gets up and he hits our first one, and then the second at bat, he hits that one. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1073.96s)]
*  And we have great confidence, and they've lost their confidence, as I said. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1080.76s)]
*  I think it's cool that we just now live in a totally separate universe. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1084.6000000000001s)]
*  I know I've done this thing where we'll look at like as Mingold's chat while he's watching, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1091.8s)]
*  you know, like a video game stream and, and how predictably they start spamming DEI, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1098.52s)]
*  but I'm truly fascinated with the other side of America at this point, where Donald Trump, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1104.52s)]
*  a New York real estate billionaire fail son, rambles on and on about golf [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1112.76s)]
*  during a historic period of, of inflation. Okay. After, you know, defeating the Democratic party [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1121.64s)]
*  due to the cost of living crisis and how he said he was going to fix it only to seemingly make it [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1132.28s)]
*  worse with a lot of the insane actions they've taken so far in dismantling the, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1138.28s)]
*  the, the administrative state. Okay. And we're over here. Like we're over here watching him [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1146.68s)]
*  ramble on and on about golfing. And I'm, I'm just, I'm wondering like, how, like, how do people who [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1152.84s)]
*  like this respond to what they are seeing? I want to see this. I want to see, hold on. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1160.36s)]
*  Let me, let me, let me see. Let me see if I can, is this the correct one? No, it's not. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1167.72s)]
*  No, I want to see the more I'm morbidly curious about it. What do we like better? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1175.4s)]
*  Or sleepy Joe ready? Ready? Crooked Joe or sleepy. Ready? Crooked Joe. Like what is the reaction [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1181.88s)]
*  to it? Like what are they got to stay with? He had one ability that I didn't have. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1190.68s)]
*  He could do something that I couldn't do. I don't say that because he was a horrible [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1196.52s)]
*  golf. Remember he challenged me during the debate to a golf. He said, I'm a six handicap. I said, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1199.96s)]
*  you're not a 36 handicap. He said he's a six. And then he said, well, I'm eight. Remember? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1205.24s)]
*  Sleepy is way better. Definitely sleepy. Like, are they just reacting to like how funny Trump is or [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  something? I suspect that that's what it is. Right? Amazing. He could go with cameras on him, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1215.8s)]
*  television, fake news on him, probably because he knows they wouldn't cover it badly. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1222.04s)]
*  Crooked Hillary. As well as you can cover him. There's like a, there's a couple people in there [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1225.48s)]
*  just being like, hey, somebody thought he looked great in a bathing suit. There's a couple people [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1230.28s)]
*  in there being pulling a thing to wait about six ounces. You know, those aluminum, see aluminum's [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1238.76s)]
*  very good. You can, a child, it's meant for children and very old people to lift. Right? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1243.6399999999999s)]
*  Stand up comedian and it put it down and it fall into it and he'd immediately fall asleep in front [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1248.9199999999998s)]
*  of the media. I could never do that. That's not running out of content and has the other streamers [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1254.52s)]
*  chats. This is not even a stocking of other streamers. Shaz. This is a very active comm the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1259.32s)]
*  other side operates online, especially because I know conservatives in the real world, but I wish [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1264.6799999999998s)]
*  I could under, but I want to understand how conservatives in the online sphere, especially [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1272.12s)]
*  the sphere that we're in on Twitch, like what their takeaway is. This is basically an [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1276.52s)]
*  anthropological study at this stage. Okay. Do you not want to know? Are you not interested? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1282.84s)]
*  I'm genuinely interested. I'm it's, this is not to like disparage people. I'm not trying to like [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1291.08s)]
*  dunk on Asmongold or his chat or anything like that. I just want to understand what their takeaway [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1296.2s)]
*  is from a speech like this one. You know, it's true. I do also despise the chat hoppers that [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1302.36s)]
*  instantly went over there to fucking be annoying. So I'm going to probably shut this off. That's [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1309.4799999999998s)]
*  true. Now Franklin Graham's angry at me. People can't help themselves. You know that Franklin [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1314.4399999999998s)]
*  wrote me a letter. He said, I love your speeches. I love them. I love them so much. You're, you're [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1319.3999999999999s)]
*  ruining my day. Better if you would never use foul language. And I told him, I said, Franklin, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1323.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, Franklin Graham's a great guy, by the way, does a great job. The son of the great [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1328.92s)]
*  Billy Graham, right? But I said to Franklin, you know, sometimes you need it for emphasis. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1333.72s)]
*  And he said, no, no, they'd be even better if you wouldn't use any bad language. That's [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1341.72s)]
*  not really a terrible word, you know, but that's a much more appropriate word, a better, what word [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1346.28s)]
*  I use to describe what word can I use? So, and we have to be truthful too. So, you know, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1351.4s)]
*  if you can't understand what people like about Donald Trump, you'll never be able to, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1360.2s)]
*  you'll never be able to approach them and talk to them where they're at. Okay. That's how that's [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1365.08s)]
*  what I believe 100%. Like most and from what I see at a cursory glance, most of the takeaway is that [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1370.36s)]
*  they just find it incredibly, incredibly entertaining. This is cinema, cinema, truthful [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1379.48s)]
*  bros bringing back the apprentice. Like, why would you better routine the most comedians? Law? I think [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1385.88s)]
*  that's what it is. A lot of people despise the democratic party for understandable reasons. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1392.76s)]
*  And some of them despise the democratic party for lame reasons, but I think the output is still [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1399.64s)]
*  the same. He's dunking on the Dems in the way that these guys are approaching the subject. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1405.88s)]
*  They're looking at this and they're going, Oh, he's shitting on my enemies. The Dems, the liberal [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1410.7600000000002s)]
*  elite, Biden didn't want to do, and nobody wanted to do. It's true. Like the full might and power [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1414.68s)]

*  they make our criminals look like nice people. It's true. Remember when they used to say people [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1435.16s)]

*  us look like babies. I mean, we hate the Democrats as well. For the most part, people on earth, but [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1452.44s)]
*  I think the reasons as to why they hate the Democrats are very different than the reasons [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1460.8400000000001s)]
*  as to why we hate the Democrats. I think I would go so far as to say that my reasons for hating [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1464.28s)]
*  politicians across the board is pretty valid. I'm talking about Ms. 13. They're hunting them down. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1469.08s)]

*  rooted out, arrested and expelled from our soil like the savage monsters that they are. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1484.68s)]
*  We don't have anybody coming up from Argentina. Nobody's coming up from [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1491.64s)]
*  Argentina recruiting about the sky rocket. This is a totally made up conservative meta [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1496.04s)]
*  where they think like the hell's angels. If you want to understand like conservative [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1505.3200000000002s)]

*  biker gangs because there's like a lot of television series about this shit. So they [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1514.8400000000001s)]
*  unironically think like a lot of older conservatives. And I'm surprised to see this [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1519.08s)]
*  like online as well. 99% biker gang hunt them like slave. We hunting you down daddy, like [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1522.44s)]

*  basically there's just like conservative meta where they think that like, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1541.4s)]
*  where where they think that like hell's angels are like the defenders of America against like [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1545.88s)]
*  the big bad undocumented migrant groups that are doing crime. Terminated the green new scam. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1550.92s)]
*  One of the greatest hoaxes ever played on this country is the green new scam. We spent [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1560.2s)]
*  trillions of dollars on this nonsense and just a total hoax. It really set back our country. I [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1565.0s)]

*  vehicle mandate where everybody has to have an electric car. Yeah, yeah, that's real. That's [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1579.56s)]
*  definitely if you want an electric car, get an electric car. If you want a gasoline powered car, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1584.84s)]
*  if you want to have a hybrid, you get it. The only thing you can corrupt green scam climate [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1589.6399999999999s)]
*  change is a hoax question mark. They said it really works great. But when it does, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1596.52s)]
*  warming is in real. I guess like younger chatters probably believe global warming. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1600.6s)]
*  They found the body on a tree about 250 yards up there. It's seriously bad. So we'll leave [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1607.24s)]

*  a federal regulation freeze and a foreign aid freeze. We're given to the people who ask how [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1624.84s)]
*  do we reach these guys? How do we reach the right wing and change their minds? It's pretty simple. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1631.08s)]
*  You just have to wait because inevitably Donald Trump's actions are going to harm them directly. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1638.6s)]
*  And in that moment where they recognize that harm, there's only two ways out of it. Either [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1645.08s)]
*  they double down and engage in cultish behavior and engage in culture thinking in many will, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1651.72s)]
*  or someone approaches them with a helping hand. Okay. Someone approaches them with a helping hand [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1657.48s)]
*  and says like, you want to know who the real people are? That is that's fucking you over. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1664.76s)]
*  It's all of Trump's allies, all these rich people. Okay. The issue, however, is that there is no [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1669.24s)]
*  competent Democratic party right now that is actively doing that because they also, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1675.8s)]
*  they also are, they have the same exact fucking, they have the same exact corporate benefactors. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1685.96s)]
*  Like Democrats love the rich guys as well. So they can't actually, they can't actually launch [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1691.72s)]
*  or amount any sort of significant opposition from a true populist perspective. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1698.84s)]

*  This is truly an opportune moment in all of this crisis. Okay. I think that in this moment of crisis [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1719.8s)]
*  where Americans will recognize that even under the Trump leadership, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1728.84s)]
*  their lives haven't gotten better because you can't, you can't fix that. Like lies will not change [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1733.08s)]
*  the fact that you're still struggling lies and your attention being laser focused on trans people [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1739.8799999999999s)]
*  or Guatemalan migrants or whatever, won't change the reality that you're having issues with paying [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1747.56s)]
*  rent still. But Trump is now president and he said everything was going to get better, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1752.6799999999998s)]
*  but it's not happening now in that circumstance, in that circumstance, if you're going to be [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1756.36s)]
*  you don't have a competent party that uses that to correctly change people's attention, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1763.16s)]
*  to correctly shift people's attention and priorities back to the real centers of pain, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1771.4s)]
*  billionaires, the oligarchy, corporations, okay. And utilize true left-wing economic populist [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1777.0800000000002s)]
*  messaging and actively try to push for an agenda that will radically change the trajectory of [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1787.88s)]

*  think, Oh, the problem is we just simply haven't killed enough Guatemalans. You know what I mean? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1806.28s)]
*  We simply haven't done enough deportations. Why haven't we done enough deportations? Well, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1811.64s)]
*  because we haven't done enough deportations because the Democrats are probably stopping [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1818.3600000000001s)]
*  us from doing all the deportations or we simply have to up the ante. We simply have to be even [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1822.92s)]
*  more violent. Right? That's what I fear. I fear that in this moment of crisis, okay. What I asked [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1828.2s)]
*  the questionable trans people and they made some incredible arguments. Your discord is amazing. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1837.88s)]
*  What are you saying? I just shut up. I have no idea what you're trying to say. Okay. In this [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1841.16s)]
*  moment of crisis, there's only one figure that I've seen on the democratic party side that has, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1848.0400000000002s)]
*  which is ironically, he's a, ironically, he's an independent technically, but Bernie Sanders is [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1855.3200000000002s)]
*  the only person I've seen that is like a line with the Democrats that has been actively trying to [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1861.96s)]
*  tackle this issue. And I don't even agree with most of his foreign policy, but it doesn't matter. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1867.0s)]
*  Okay. On, on the issue of domestic affairs, like he is, he's actively trying to tackle it. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1871.96s)]
*  And it seems like he's garnering a lot of support and a lot of attention. And yet [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1877.8s)]
*  the Democrats are still avoiding that reality. They're still refusing to, to take a look at [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1882.92s)]
*  what's going on here. Look, face shocker says I've helped Bernie Sanders for years pulling together [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1888.6s)]
*  his political events. Today is the first in many ways. We had two different large overflow crowds [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1893.88s)]
*  in Iowa city. One of the overflows was so large that it was bigger than the original theater. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1897.96s)]
*  He came to speak at it is obvious that a lot of people, and these are, these are older people, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1901.8s)]
*  these are older white Democrats, older white Democrats at the heart of the democratic party's [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1907.72s)]
*  base of voters are on ironically looking at the situation and thinking, okay, something's got to [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1914.1200000000001s)]
*  change. Okay. This much enthusiasm with one degree windchill temperatures, while every other [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1920.12s)]

*  wrong way. Like it's, it's obvious this is real. This is a very real thing. Over 110 years, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1932.36s)]
*  3.47 million people who are over 120 years of age, 3.9 million. No, I'm not saying Bernie [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1943.6399999999999s)]
*  as the figure is the reason why he's drawing these crowds. I mean, yes, his track record [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1954.36s)]
*  plays a role in this. His, his, his favor bills play a role in this, but it's not just Bernie. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1960.6799999999998s)]
*  It's the fact that his message is being broadly received as a positive, even from the ranks of [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1968.1200000000001s)]
*  the democratic party's base of support, like their most loyal base of support. And it's not just his [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1973.64s)]
*  message is also his earnest delivery because he has, regardless of the insane amount of attacks [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1979.88s)]
*  that he's received throughout his career, he has stayed the course. Okay. Bernie ain't too old. If [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1987.5600000000002s)]
*  he's walking and talking just fine. I mean, come on guys, he's 90. Like that's crazy. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=1994.52s)]
*  He's 90 years old. I still vote for him. I don't care, but like, let's be real. Okay. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2000.52s)]

*  We will not allow anyone to cheat our seniors. And those who will do that will be prosecuted by Pam [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2029.16s)]
*  Bondi. And I think, I think a lot of people, I think a lot of people just love this shit. They [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2036.2s)]
*  just look at this and they go, this is amazing. Like there's a guy in there that said people need [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2041.4s)]

*  the same as your regular streams? Much love, hustle. Uh, yes. Obviously when the president [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2208.84s)]
*  is currently speaking at CPAC, I think it's important to hear what he has to say. Um, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2214.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm a political commentator after all. So yes, I do start off with a little bit of politics on [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2219.8s)]
*  Saturday as well. It's a live speech and then I move on to other shit. I'm an Indian. She said, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2224.1200000000003s)]
*  uh, could we see proof of that place? She said, well, the only proof I have is my mother said I [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2230.2799999999997s)]
*  have high cheekbones. Oh, that's not, that's no good. Right. Remember she went out. I really [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2235.72s)]
*  spooked her. I tell you. Remember she went out. She couldn't take it anymore. It's going to poke [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2242.36s)]
*  out this poke out this. Everyone knew she was not an Indian. I really do think that, uh, I mean, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2246.36s)]
*  looking at some Asmongold's chat, it does, it does make me feel like it's just purely entertainment. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2253.24s)]
*  Like they just think he's fucking hilarious. You know what I mean? They just straight up think [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2259.8799999999997s)]
*  he's killing it. Like he's doing killer bits. That's it. There is, I don't think there's a lot [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2266.6s)]
*  of interest in like the actual policy behind it. I don't think that there is any, I don't know if [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2271.8799999999997s)]
*  that's because of the way Asmongold covers it. Cause I'm unfamiliar with the way he covers Donald [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2278.7599999999998s)]
*  Trump. Maybe he just says like, Oh, it's pure entertainment. It's pure entertainment. It's so [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2283.08s)]
*  funny. He's so based. Maybe that's the reason why the community is reflecting the opinion of the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2287.4s)]
*  streamer in that regard. Or maybe it's because that is truly what they derive out of the Trump [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2291.88s)]
*  administration. Like they just think it's content. And I guess if you're like a stay at home neat or [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2296.7599999999998s)]
*  whatever, and not a fucking federal government employee whose job is on the line, then yeah, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2303.24s)]
*  he is just entertainment. It's like the opposite side of the liberal part of the equation, the [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2309.8s)]
*  upper middle-class liberal professional manager class liberals who don't have much to lose. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2314.92s)]
*  And you're still this charitable to Asmongold in his chat. No dude, I'm not a fucking idiot. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2322.04s)]
*  And I want to understand where people are coming from. If you are going to be this resentful, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2327.5600000000004s)]
*  and if you're going to operate on the, on the notion that like me trying to make an assessment [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2333.2400000000002s)]
*  on what people like about Donald Trump is seemingly a bridge too far, like, and that I [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2338.68s)]
*  should be advocating to say that they're all fucking Nazis and they should immediately be [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2346.52s)]
*  sent to the gulags. Like, I don't know what to tell you. Okay. It's very, I think it's very fucking [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2350.52s)]
*  important to understand why there is so much momentum in Trump's direction. Okay. If you [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2355.24s)]
*  don't understand it, then you can never address it. If you don't understand the problem, if you [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2362.44s)]
*  refuse to understand the problem, if you refuse to understand what this fucking dipshit saying is, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2367.32s)]
*  why that is like being perceived as such a positive way, then you'll never be able to [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2373.56s)]
*  solve this issue. Isn't a, isn't a faulty premise to guess that people have any interest in policy? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2377.7200000000003s)]
*  99% of people are vibes only. I think so. I think that is a big part of that. I mean, look, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2382.2000000000003s)]
*  there are a lot of people that simply don't vote for either party. There's a multitude of different [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2387.4s)]
*  reasons as to why they don't vote for either party. Obviously the electoral college plays a big [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2391.2400000000002s)]
*  role in this, but the inaction and, and the, the lack of the, the, the, the belief that people have [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2395.24s)]
*  that the Democrats are not really doing anything for them or the rogues are not doing anything for [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2405.24s)]
*  them is a place, a big role in this. Okay. But for the people that do vote, 80% of them vote [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2411.4799999999996s)]
*  for partisan reasons. Okay. At least that's what empirical evidence shows. 80% of people, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2420.84s)]
*  80% of people vote simply because their parents voted that way, simply because they've always [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2427.0800000000004s)]
*  voted that way, yada, yada, yada. Okay. Then there's the 20% of people that vote for policy [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2431.0800000000004s)]
*  related reasons. Okay. Policy related reasons. And those 20% that vote for, I guess like, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2437.5600000000004s)]
*  or ideological reasons beyond policy or not beyond policy, but ideological reasons that [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2448.36s)]
*  pertain to policy. That's it. 20%. That's it. And there are a tremendous number of [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2455.0s)]
*  individuals out there that simply don't vote at all. So of course, a lot of the people that do vote, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2461.6400000000003s)]
*  vote on partisan grounds and it's simply team sport for them. And lo and behold, for many of [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2466.92s)]
*  those people that do go out and vote on purely team sport related reasons. Yeah. The stakes are [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2474.04s)]
*  low for them, both on the liberal side and the Republican side, both on the Democrat side and [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2481.96s)]
*  the Republican side, the stakes are low because they're in the upper crust. Okay. They're in the [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2486.68s)]
*  top 10%. They have homes, they're older, right? They have their nest egg. When you start looking [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2491.64s)]
*  at who doesn't vote, you start to recognize that it's mostly poor people that don't vote. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2499.8s)]
*  It's the most marginalized people in society that don't actually end up voting. Forgot about racism [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2504.6800000000003s)]
*  as well. No, I put racism into the ideological camp as well. Adrian is online. Thank you for the 10 [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2508.92s)]
*  give the subs. I think it's interesting to understand. Yes, they're openly just consumers. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2516.92s)]
*  Everything is content. It means nothing. Asman himself repeats how nihilistic his worldview is [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2520.76s)]
*  constantly. They want to sit at home and jack off the teenage anime girls with big boobs on their [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2524.2000000000003s)]
*  favorite video games and acting that way is seen as a virtue. If Asman has an ideology is [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2527.32s)]
*  hyper hedonistic consumerism above all else. I mean, yeah, but it's not just Asman. I think it's [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2531.32s)]
*  just Americans in general, when they have nothing else. And the only thing they have is, is consumption [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2536.52s)]
*  of commodities because that's what America is. Then yeah, you're your, the things that you consume [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2541.88s)]
*  define you, whether it be, you know, teenage anime girls with big titties, or whether it be [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2549.0s)]
*  guns for many people, right? Cause that's still a commodity. It's a very significant identity marker. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2555.8s)]
*  And that's all, all political battles are basically fought on those boundaries. There is no real [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2562.52s)]
*  material impact. That's how the team sports are defined basically. And that's why you see a lot [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2569.0s)]
*  of liberals who would actively go after what kind of content you're consuming. You know what I mean? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2573.8s)]
*  What kind of content you're consuming says a lot about your morality. Oh, you're watching the bad [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2579.48s)]
*  content and not the good content. That means like you're a bad person. All this stuff. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2583.56s)]
*  It's completely meaningless. Okay. Now we're bringing them down to 15% [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2588.2s)]
*  if you make your product in the United States of America. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2594.12s)]
*  We're defending the American worker like never before. And that's why the auto workers and the [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2599.7999999999997s)]
*  union workers and teamsters and so many others, they supported us, the firemen, the policemen, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2605.64s)]
*  so many others, whether they were union or non-union, they all supported us. They [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2611.48s)]
*  supported us. It's called workers. They supported us at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2615.4s)]
*  Weeks ago, I imposed a 10% tariff on all goods coming from China because of the fact that- [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2620.44s)]
*  People have both views of your viewers. It's nutty how perspective affects all that. What do you mean? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2626.04s)]
*  I'm not happy with Mexico or I'm not happy with Canada. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2631.32s)]
*  You can't make voting compulsory in a country that doesn't have a federal holiday for voting. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2634.2000000000003s)]
*  That's ridiculous. Americans, regardless of party affiliation, both parties have always been [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2638.52s)]
*  very upset at the prospect of every single person having to vote. They don't want everybody to vote. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2646.12s)]
*  Let's make no mistake. That's why you can't make voting compulsory in this country. That's why you [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2651.4s)]
*  can't even make it a fucking national. You can't make it even a federal holiday to go out and vote. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2655.56s)]
*  Very rich. I always say it's my favorite word in the dictionary. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2659.8s)]
*  Okay. The word tariff is my favorite word in the dictionary. You know, we were richest, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2663.24s)]
*  the richest relatively from- think of this- from 1870 to 1913. That was our richest because we [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2668.3599999999997s)]
*  collected tariffs from foreign countries that came in and took our jobs and took our money, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2676.52s)]
*  took our everything. But they charged tariffs and we had so much money. They set up the 1887- [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2682.9199999999996s)]
*  think of that, a long time ago, 1887 tariff commission. It was a commission of very important [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2690.2s)]
*  people to determine where we should spend all of the tremendous vast wealth that we had. We had so [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2695.3199999999997s)]
*  much wealth. Wouldn't it be nice today? Of course, now we give it away to transgender this, transgender [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2700.52s)]
*  that. Yeah, yeah, that's what's happening. Everybody gets a transgender operation. Let's see how they react to that one. They took our jobs. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2706.2s)]
*  No, we give it away like crazy things. But in those days, it was different. It was a different [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2710.7599999999998s)]
*  world. It was a different country. But we were very rich because of tariffs. And I get myself in [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2715.7999999999997s)]
*  trouble because I say that tariff is my favorite word. And the fake news went crazy. What about- [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2721.24s)]
*  It's bro. It's like, it's like a flashbang, dude. It's like jiggling keys in front of a fucking baby. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2727.24s)]
*  That's what it is. He just says transgender and everybody just lasers in on that. Not realizing [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2733.3199999999997s)]
*  that he's like hyping up a time where he's hyping up a time where there was like, until now, peak [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2738.9199999999996s)]
*  income inequality that led to absolute devastation, economic devastation. You know, we're talking about [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2744.84s)]
*  the Great Depression here under positive terms. Think about that. Like what led to the Great Depression [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2750.52s)]
*  and he's talking about that era as a positive when we unironically have more instability [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2759.88s)]
*  and more economic inequality now than we did back then. You know, I rebuilt our entire military in [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2766.92s)]
*  the first term. We left a lot of it. He could just be like, robber barons are so good. They're [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2773.32s)]
*  wealth providers and job makers. You are all servile. And then as long as he ties it up with like, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2778.6000000000004s)]
*  and transgenders, we're going to kill them. Everybody be like, hell yeah, based. He's so funny. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2788.28s)]
*  He said, when I see that angry, when I see that I get angry. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2793.08s)]
*  You know, we give them, I don't think anyone knows this. We give Afghanistan about two or two and a [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2802.6s)]
*  half billion dollars. You know that for aid, aid, we need aid ourselves. And I'm going to go back [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2808.84s)]
*  and tell them, Deborah loved that one. Deborah lost her mind. The brissy is cackling. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2818.2000000000003s)]
*  They're selling it. Doug, would you take that place? All right, write something up. Now I want [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2828.04s)]
*  them to give back. If we're going to give them that kind of money, let them give back the military [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2833.96s)]
*  equipment, which they have. They have tanks and trucks and guns and goggles. They have goggles. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2837.2400000000002s)]
*  They have night goggles better than we have brand new right out of the box. It's unbelievable. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2843.88s)]
*  So I want to do that. And I want the if we're going to pay them, I want to get [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2849.8s)]
*  that equipment back. Okay, Doug can do it. He's one of the guys. He's a business guy. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2854.12s)]
*  They hear me sitting there saying, how the hell did this ever happen? Right? Can you believe it? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=2860.2000000000003s)]

*  Yeah, I watched the hostage release earlier, which was crazy. The hostage release Hamas, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3003.4s)]
*  it's amazing. The drug that makes you dab up Hamas. They also now have a drug that makes [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3009.24s)]
*  you kiss Hamas. Yes, I saw that. They did it. They found, they found even a newer drug. Previously, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3013.32s)]

*  kiss them. It's crazy. A little glimmer of hope. And I say, let them have that hope, right? Let [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3028.1200000000003s)]
*  them have that hope. But getting the body back is just as important as getting the son back healthy [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3033.4s)]
*  or the daughter back healthy. It's amazing to see when I, when I see the level of intensity and love [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3039.4s)]
*  and sorrow and tragedy. As I said in my inaugural address, it's my hope that my greatest legacy will [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3045.2400000000002s)]

*  Oh yeah, definitely. Under the Trump administration, every day brings more [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3057.96s)]
*  good news for America. I've ended all of the so-called diversity, equity and inclusion programs [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3065.48s)]

*  DEI is being deleted. Hell yeah. United States government that there are only two genders, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3091.88s)]
*  male and female. That was easy. I banned men from competing in women's sports and I also proudly [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3096.6s)]

*  with critical race theory and all of that. It's like the other things that we had to put up with. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3129.48s)]
*  It is like the family guy clip where Lois Griffin is saying, 9-11, but instead of 9-11, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3134.84s)]
*  he's just going, DEI, DEI. And then everybody goes, this is fucking amazing. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3140.76s)]

*  I banned government censorship from your voices and brought back free speech in America. We have [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3170.76s)]
*  free speech. We didn't have free speech. We do have it now, actually. Now, this was a very vicious [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3186.6800000000003s)]
*  regime, you know? I was put under investigation more so than the late great Alphonse Capone, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3191.96s)]
*  one of the great killers of the world. Trump, my father would look down, my mother, how the hell [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3198.76s)]
*  did this happen to my boy? This was his... No, I was under investigation at a far greater level [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3203.0800000000004s)]
*  than Al Capone or anybody else, probably in the history of our country. These people are sick. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3208.76s)]
*  They're sick. They're bad people. I ended Joe Biden's weaponization as soon as I got in. I said, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3213.88s)]
*  I'm going to hit him with the same stuff. But I ended his whole weaponization of our government [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3219.96s)]
*  and removed his handpicked radical left, Marxist prosecutors from the Department of Justice. I was [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3227.48s)]
*  so happy to do that. They weaponized government. They weaponized government. I pardoned hundreds [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3232.84s)]
*  and hundreds of... Including Christians, pro-life activists, and the J6 hostages who were treated [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3242.12s)]
*  terribly for years. We even got rid of people like Pete Buttigieg, who did the worst job of anybody [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3249.56s)]
*  in the history of transportation. What a bunch of losers. I revoked the security clearances [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3269.08s)]
*  of Anthony Blinken, Jake Sullivan, John Brennan, James Clapper, and every non-patriot who lied [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3277.96s)]
*  to cover up Hunter Biden's laptop from hell. We took away their security clearance. How dare you? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3285.08s)]
*  How dare you come after Pete, who kept all of the planes in the sky from falling like shooting stars? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3292.12s)]
*  Okay, that's crazy. Pete Buttigieg protected us with his gay powers. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3300.52s)]
*  Now these were bad people. These were bad people. And I... [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3311.0s)]
*  Because this should never be allowed to happen again. What happened to me in this administration, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3315.3199999999997s)]
*  what happened on J6, what happened on all of the things they did that were so bad, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3319.72s)]
*  should never ever be allowed to happen again. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3324.68s)]
*  And on a friendlier note, I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3330.2s)]
*  And we are restoring the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley in Alaska. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3342.8399999999997s)]
*  And as you know, many years ago, Jimmy Carter gave away the Panama Canal. And Panama [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3355.3199999999997s)]
*  started the process of giving the Panama Canal, by the way, the most expensive development ever [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3367.08s)]
*  in the history of our country, relatively. It would have been one and a half trillion in today's dollars. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3372.44s)]
*  38,000 people died from our country building the Panama Canal. They died from mosquitoes and snakes. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3379.0s)]
*  Think of it. They paid them five times their salary. They brought them to Panama, and they had a 25% [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3389.0s)]
*  chance of dying. They dug under nets so the mosquitoes wouldn't get them. But we lost 38,000, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3395.72s)]
*  mostly men laborers, instruction workers, because it was such a harsh way to live. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3403.16s)]
*  What a president. Again, it was the most expensive thing we ever built. And they gave it away. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3410.36s)]
*  Suffers can't be blamed. Their affliction prevents logical thought and reasoning. They can't be [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3418.92s)]
*  helpful. One of the most successful projects ever built in terms of money monetarily. And it's the [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3424.04s)]
*  eighth wonder of the world. It connects two oceans, with one being 16 feet higher than the other. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3431.16s)]
*  Think of it. The Pacific and the Atlantic. Think of what that is. You're going through [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3437.8799999999997s)]
*  dikes and canals. Amazing what they did. It was really a wonder of the world. We gave it away. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3443.3999999999996s)]
*  We're so cucked, dude. But we didn't give it to China. We're fucking cucked. We didn't give it to [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3448.7599999999998s)]
*  China. We gave it to Panama. We're going to take back the Panama Canal. It's over, dude. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3453.8799999999997s)]
*  And a matter of weeks, we have restored America's pride, America's confidence and America's spirit. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3461.16s)]
*  Tell the truth. Not enough hogs in your chat. That's why you need to look at Asmins. Yes, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3469.8799999999997s)]
*  this is 100% correct because back in the day, because Asmongold wasn't a political commentator, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3474.3599999999997s)]
*  there wasn't a space for hogs to go to. So they would come here. And I, I think that was important [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3480.92s)]
*  in informing my perspective about like what they were paying attention to and what they were getting, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3487.72s)]
*  you know, like what they were focusing on. And now the hogs are gone. They all left [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3493.48s)]
*  because they want their own hug box. They want their own echo chamber. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3500.52s)]
*  And it's ironically turned this community more into an echo chamber. And I don't like that. So now [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3504.6s)]
*  I'm looking at where the hogs are to try to fucking understand where they're coming from. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3509.16s)]
*  I need to do this. Okay. I'm an anthropologist. Okay. I'm a hog here. I enjoy the seething. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3513.96s)]

*  understand the reason why, the reason why I look at mostly right-wing content and cover mostly [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3534.36s)]
*  like right-wing fascinations is because I need to understand that better. I need to understand. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3544.28s)]

*  understanding of where right-wingers are coming from, what they actually enjoy, you know, what [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGYtgIUXJQ&t=3573.96s)]
