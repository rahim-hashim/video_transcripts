# Why American Trucks Are A SCAM | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE)
*  What's crazy is that like Japan has smaller K truck, Toyota trucks that they're not allowed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=0.0s)]
*  to sell in the United States of America. And those shits are like 10 grand. So, and they're [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  better than this and they're not an Evie and they got stereos in it for 10 grand, but I'm [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=11.96s)]
*  not going to immediately shit on it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=20.72s)]
*  I think it's cool. I'm glad any initiative that tries to sell smaller. Wait, BYD just [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=23.46s)]
*  watched a black Chinese cars are different. Oh, look at that. Controversial opinion I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=29.68s)]
*  have is that I don't really care for a lot of these bells and whistles personally in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=42.44s)]
*  cars and the Chinese market loves this shit, dude. They love this shit. They love their [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=47.08s)]
*  little gadgets and gizmos in their cars. The bells and whistles wouldn't matter in America [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=58.28s)]
*  because you can't sit in your car anywhere anyway. What's the point of being into guns [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  if you're not walking around like Desperado? I agree. I have seen slate trucks. I am not [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=66.4s)]
*  entirely certain. It's Jeff Bezos pumped by the way. It's a bunch of VCs guys that like [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=71.68s)]
*  a bunch of Silicon Valley guys that have gotten into it. I am very familiar with it. I've [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=80.08s)]
*  a lot of the Tik Tok ads. I love that it's a, it's a, what's it called? Like a single [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=84.28s)]
*  cab. It's the, it is basically the size of like a Toyota Hilux from the eighties, from [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=89.84s)]
*  the nineties. And I think it's very cool. Problem is, Oh here, I'll tell you some of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=97.68s)]
*  the cool stuff. Modular car building. Awesome. Okay. Bit of a recession indicator, I think, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  but also kind of cool. Like I was talking to my brother about this and he was saying [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=111.44s)]
*  like modular cars are super popular in India. I don't know if that's the case at all, or [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=115.16s)]
*  maybe he just made it up, but I do like the modular card car build. Okay. What is modular? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=121.28s)]
*  For those of you who are asking like this car can just as easily turn into a two seater. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=131.32s)]
*  Like they just bust a, yeah. See that car can turn into this with like one module that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  they add. So major issues, major issues of the car is like 150 to 185 mile range. These [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=144.36s)]
*  are EVs. The average daily driver uses like max max is their commute out at like 40 miles, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  I believe. So barring some other places that you might need to go for longer distances, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=167.28s)]
*  like this is perfectly fine. But again, there's not a lot of, there's not a lot of a, there [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  isn't a robust electric charger infrastructure in this country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=181.76s)]
*  Toe capacity of a current day Ford Mustang, whatever, dude, that doesn't matter. The 20 [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=188.0s)]
*  K option literally doesn't even have a stereo in the car. So I don't know. I like it. I [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=193.48s)]
*  like it as a concept. Think American K truck. I love that. What's crazy is that like Japan [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=201.56s)]
*  has smaller K truck, Toyota trucks that they are not allowed to sell in the United States [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=207.04s)]
*  of America. And those shits are like 10 grand. So, and they're better than this and they're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=213.0s)]
*  not an EV and they got in stereos in it for 10 grand. But I'm not going to immediately [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=218.86s)]
*  shit on it. I think it's cool. I'm glad any initiative that tries to sell smaller. Wait, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  BYD just launched a black myth Wukong EV for 200k or 20k. Oh my god. Oh my god. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=233.26000000000002s)]
*  That looks so nasty. Ooh. Anyways, I was saying I'm in, I'm in favor of any kind of small [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=245.66s)]
*  off road or slash truck. So it's cool. Yeah. I didn't like the paint job, but I do like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  the mods. Tilo was founded by two co-founders from Tesla. The truck is the size of a mini [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=264.48s)]
*  Cooper yet still fits a four by eight piece of plywood and seats up to eight. Yeah. I [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=269.88s)]
*  was going to say the biggest lie ever told in the United States of America is that the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=275.74s)]
*  trucks have to be big. They do not have to be big. They do not have to be big at all. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=282.3s)]
*  This truck can literally haul the same type of shit that those massive trucks can haul. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=287.74s)]
*  It has the same bed. It has the same bed size. Like it's, it's ridiculous. And like, when [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=294.62s)]
*  you think about the Ford Maverick or whatever, or the smaller versions that are coming out [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=299.26s)]
*  now, it's like the Ford Maverick itself is still fairly large in comparison to trucks [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=304.32s)]
*  elsewhere. More on the Tilo truck. What the heck is this? Wait, this is some of this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  company's from America and they're called Tello and this little red truck is called the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=316.04s)]
*  MT1. This was inspired by Japanese K truck. So it's really small and it even has a five [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=319.64s)]
*  foot bed on something the same size as a mini in the back. I have built in power and a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=324.04s)]
*  railing system, but watch this. Now on top of my five foot bed, I can fold down a mid gate [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=328.0s)]
*  to give me an eight foot bed. And if I push this little black button right here, that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=334.26s)]
*  gives me access to the gear tunnel and the backing of it. One, two, three people across, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=337.94s)]
*  but only in a pinch. And my feet have plenty of room because the seat has a floating design [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=342.34s)]
*  inside. You get this giant glass roof, these fabric seats that may be heated or ventilated. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=346.94s)]
*  I don't know. It's still a prototype, but I do get storage space here, a cup holder, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=350.66s)]
*  this awesome looking touchscreen and this awesome digital display. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=354.14s)]
*  Yeah. This car is like 40 grand. That's crazy. This vehicle that we're looking at that looks [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=357.12s)]
*  like like a go-kart is still 40 grand. So get an estimated 350 miles. It's come standard [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=362.76s)]
*  with a Tesla plug. It can tow 6,600 pounds. And oh yeah, it makes 500 horsepower. What [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=368.64s)]
*  the heck is this? What's your opinion on this discourse? Yeah. The 100, 100 dudes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=377.52s)]
*  Versus 100 men versus one gorilla is the pop in Twitter discourse and I have no answer [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  for it. I'm too tired. I don't know why I'm I know I played way too much basketball this [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  morning. I'm gonna end it. I'm going to do a I'm doing a full official half day today [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=401.68s)]
*  with the five hour and 30 minute chat. I'll be back tomorrow. I love you all. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad2RA4QsxnE&t=405.76s)]
