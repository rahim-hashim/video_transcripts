# Hasan & Mizkif Learn How To Be Sexier At Twerk Camp
**HasanAbi:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak)
*  restored now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=0.0s)]
*  That was good. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=30.0s)]
*  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, today is what day 12? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=43.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=47.0s)]
*  Of Japan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=48.0s)]
*  Or something along those lines, not entirely sure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=49.0s)]
*  Never going back, man. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=52.0s)]
*  And there's an air of sadness that I feel that I think you probably also felt yesterday as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=53.0s)]
*  You didn't feel sad when everyone left? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=59.0s)]
*  I did, yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=61.0s)]
*  I felt sad, and it wasn't just because all my friends are leaving and now I'm stuck with f***ing Miskif, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=62.0s)]
*  which is a big L in and of itself. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=68.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=70.0s)]
*  But I also felt an air of sadness because it reminded me that my time in Japan is coming to an end. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=71.0s)]
*  And that's what was actually truly sad about the entire situation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=78.0s)]
*  Will was sad texting me from the plane. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=83.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=87.0s)]
*  He was like, I'm crying bro, please don't ever leave Japan. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=88.0s)]
*  He's already losing it a little bit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=92.0s)]
*  Or some might say he's the most sane for feeling devastated about leaving Japan. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=96.0s)]
*  On that note, today we are going to do something fantastic. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=104.0s)]
*  I'm going to make Miskif go through a humiliation ritual, pretty much. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=109.0s)]
*  I'm going to make him learn how to twerk. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=115.0s)]
*  And given that this is his second time in Japan, we'll also explore the many different bounties of Japanese culture. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=117.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=128.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to do some sussy s***. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=129.0s)]
*  I already got my... [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=131.0s)]
*  Must be nice to be so original. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=133.0s)]
*  You can be like, let's just move to Japan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is pretty nice. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=137.0s)]
*  And yet he still doesn't do it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=138.0s)]
*  And yet I don't do it. Why? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=140.0s)]
*  Because I serve you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=141.0s)]
*  I am a servant of yours, chatters. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=143.0s)]
*  And therefore I can't simply just leave everything behind and move to Japan. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=145.0s)]
*  Yes you can. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=151.0s)]
*  No I can't because the time zone is so insane that I would have to wake up at f***ing 3am every day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=153.0s)]
*  That's fine. Just start doing Japanese politics. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=158.0s)]
*  Also they don't have Zin here. That's another major L for Japan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=163.0s)]
*  They literally don't. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=167.0s)]
*  They have cigarettes everywhere, but apparently 6mg Zin is a bridge too far for the Japanese regulators. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=169.0s)]
*  I don't know what the hell... I don't know who the hell made that f***ing decision. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=177.0s)]
*  Okay, f*** the LDP is what I say. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=180.0s)]
*  Also, Kaia? Yeah, no, if I move down here I'll bring Kaia with me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=185.0s)]
*  Obviously that's not that big of an issue. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=189.0s)]
*  They have Veto, I know. I have Veto. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=192.0s)]
*  But Veto's like most... highest intensity is illegal in Japan apparently. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=194.0s)]
*  Illegal? Yeah, they don't sell it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=198.0s)]
*  They only sell 3 intensity. 1, 2, and 3. There's the 4th one that they don't sell here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=202.0s)]
*  The forbidden 4th one. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=207.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=211.0s)]
*  Are we waiting here? No, we're not waiting for Miz. He's gonna meet us there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=212.0s)]
*  Okay. I'm just pulling up the address real quick. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=217.0s)]
*  Here I can try to navigate. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=220.0s)]
*  We have some time, surprisingly enough. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=224.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=227.0s)]
*  We are, for once, now that we're not beholden to others, much more mobile. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=228.0s)]
*  You're saying everyone else was the problem. Yes, not me. Everyone else. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=234.0s)]
*  We can walk there for 25 minutes or take a train. I think we take the train for 19 minutes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=237.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. Oh, the train says significant delays. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=243.0s)]
*  Do you know what that means? I don't see that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=249.0s)]
*  At least this one. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=252.0s)]
*  The Chiyoda line has significant delays right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=255.0s)]
*  Why isn't it saying that for me? For a number of reasons. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=259.0s)]
*  It's not saying that for me. Let's just go. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=262.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=265.0s)]
*  I don't want to spike this one. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=268.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=271.0s)]
*  I guess we could technically take it from here to the Chiyoda line as well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=276.0s)]
*  He'd be at line platform 2 to Chiyoda line. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=281.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I saw the significant delays thing now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=290.0s)]
*  We'll be alright. I still got to put some money in my PASMO because I wasted all of the yen that I had in my PASMO at the fucking... [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=292.0s)]
*  At the arcade? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=304.0s)]
*  At the arcade, yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=306.0s)]
*  Yesterday? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=307.0s)]
*  At the claw machines two nights ago. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=308.0s)]
*  Did you win anything? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah, I won a Luffy. Gear 5 King Luffy as the white Luffy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=312.0s)]
*  Which was really cool, but... [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=319.0s)]
*  There was another one that I was trying to win. There was this Kirby one that I was trying to win for like 45 minutes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=324.0s)]
*  And then Ray came in and one tapped it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=330.0s)]
*  It was the most demoralizing moment of my entire life. I'm not even kidding. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=333.0s)]
*  Like literally one tapped it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=337.0s)]
*  And it was the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=339.0s)]
*  It made me realize that maybe this whole claw game shit ain't for me, little bro. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=344.0s)]
*  Just put the toy in the bag, buy it normal style. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=352.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=356.0s)]
*  But yeah, also of course we have Kawashiguiya with us today. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=357.0s)]
*  Our wonderful guide showing us the curious nature of Japan. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=361.0s)]
*  It is colder down here than it was upstairs. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=369.0s)]
*  Did you notice that? Or am I crazy? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=373.0s)]
*  It's not that bad. It's really not that bad. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=376.0s)]
*  No, it's just fine. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=378.0s)]
*  I'm all over the place, man. I don't know what I'm doing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=381.0s)]
*  It'll be okay, man. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=386.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=405.0s)]
*  What's Miskive doing out here? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=406.0s)]
*  I have no idea. I think he just wanted to escape America, just like many of us. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=408.0s)]
*  Hmm. Smart. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=414.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=416.0s)]
*  I think he wanted to escape America. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=420.0s)]
*  Mr. Arthur is here as well. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=424.0s)]
*  I've never met him. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=426.0s)]
*  Oh, you've never met Mr. Arthur? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=428.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=430.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=431.0s)]
*  Hold on, I gotta get a pass, man. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=433.0s)]
*  Oh my god, I gotta get my card out too, Chad. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=438.0s)]
*  POV, you're riding the Japanese subway. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=445.0s)]
*  Look what it says on my pass, Mo. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=455.0s)]
*  I miss Will, man. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=468.0s)]
*  He'd always laugh at my jokes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=473.0s)]
*  Billy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=487.0s)]
*  Oh, we're good. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=491.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=496.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=498.0s)]
*  Commuting with the Japanese salary men and women. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=512.0s)]
*  An experience that never gets old. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=517.0s)]
*  How was your night? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=521.0s)]
*  I took it so chill. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=523.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=526.0s)]
*  I feel like, kind of, doing our own thing out here without the bigger group, I feel like we get to chill more. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=527.0s)]
*  At least me. I get to chill a lot more. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=534.0s)]
*  Drip check. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=537.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=540.0s)]
*  Boom. Boom. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=541.0s)]
*  Y3 to out the wazoo. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=543.0s)]
*  Yeah, I see that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=545.0s)]
*  All Japanese. Color jacket. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=547.0s)]
*  Y3 all the way down. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=551.0s)]
*  Gucci down to the socks. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=553.0s)]
*  Did you get these out here too? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=556.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=557.0s)]
*  I got this in London. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=559.0s)]
*  But I got this shirt is also from Japan. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=562.0s)]
*  Etch on Mexico. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=565.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=566.0s)]
*  Is that a lie? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=567.0s)]
*  No, no, no. I got it in Japan. I got it at the boxing store. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=568.0s)]
*  Oh, oh, I see. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=571.0s)]
*  But it's red. It's a Mexican red. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=573.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=575.0s)]
*  It's a new representation. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=576.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Mexican-Japanese alliance is like this right now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=577.0s)]
*  I wanted to make sure that Mexico just defeated Donald Trump's tariff with the counter-tariff measures. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=581.0s)]
*  Donald Trump said he's going to put a pause on the tariffs on Mexico. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=586.0s)]
*  Because of that? Wow. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=589.0s)]
*  Mexico is on the other end. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=590.0s)]
*  Well, they also said that they also just basically gave assurances that they're going to combat the border and stuff, just like Canada did. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=591.0s)]
*  Which is basically nothing because it already existed. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=598.0s)]
*  They just reasserted the existing policy and now... [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=601.0s)]
*  And now Donald Trump can turn back and basically say, look, we got a victory here. We got it. We got it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=605.0s)]
*  That's like... [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=618.0s)]
*  How do you keep doing that? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=620.0s)]
*  Makes a problem that doesn't exist. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=621.0s)]
*  Dude, that is... [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=623.0s)]
*  Fixes the problem. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=624.0s)]
*  Dude, that is like the number one Trump method. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=625.0s)]
*  And we kind of forgot about it, but he used to do that all the time. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=627.0s)]
*  So sick. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=636.0s)]
*  God of America. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=637.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=638.0s)]
*  Okay, the Jadilla Line. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=639.0s)]
*  Okay, we're in the Camiacho Station right now. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=641.0s)]
*  On the Jadilla Line, we're going to be taking two stops for three minutes and get off on the Toranamo Hill Station. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=644.0s)]
*  And from there, we're going to walk two minutes to the Chioda Line. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=654.0s)]
*  He's experiencing significant delays. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=659.0s)]
*  We'll see what that looks like in Japan. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=662.0s)]
*  Probably miss that one. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=664.0s)]
*  It's like a minute to the first course. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=666.0s)]
*  The next stop is Toranamo Hill, H6. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=669.0s)]
*  Please change seats for the next stop. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=673.0s)]
*  We're going to be getting off at Toranamo Hill, sorry. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=686.0s)]
*  What is the next stop? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=689.0s)]
*  Jadilla Line. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=690.0s)]
*  We're getting off at... [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=691.0s)]
*  This is how his son sees himself. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=692.0s)]
*  There's a banger. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=723.0s)]
*  There's a banger one. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=725.0s)]
*  It's in the Sumigaseki Station. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=727.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=729.0s)]
*  It's a long way down the lake. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=736.0s)]
*  He's lucky he didn't get that haircut. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=738.0s)]
*  Apparently everybody rips phone strings out here. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=747.0s)]
*  Because the infrastructure is so good. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=750.0s)]
*  And this was unnecessarily bulky. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=753.0s)]
*  But I think the quality is so high on this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=757.0s)]
*  Because we're streaming in 4K. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=760.0s)]
*  That I think it's worth it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=763.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=765.0s)]
*  I mean, it's definitely high quality for sure. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=767.0s)]
*  But phone streams with a gimbal are always going to be simpler. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=769.0s)]
*  It's like how do you charge the phone? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=774.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=777.0s)]
*  You gotta have like a battery pack for that too. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=778.0s)]
*  And you need like a second phone. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=780.0s)]
*  I think it's like... [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=785.0s)]
*  Sunglasses make people think you are young as a boy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=787.0s)]
*  Nobody wears sunglasses in Germany. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=791.0s)]
*  Okay, first of all, that's cool. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=796.0s)]
*  I want people to think that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=799.0s)]
*  Then who's to say I'm not? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=801.0s)]
*  They need a white boy like me. An enforcer. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=804.0s)]
*  Do they have an ice skating park around the Tokyo Skytree? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=806.0s)]
*  I guess. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=810.0s)]
*  Alright, we're here. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=813.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=814.0s)]
*  This isn't it? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=815.0s)]
*  Oh wait. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=816.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=817.0s)]
*  Oh wait. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=818.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=819.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=820.0s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=823.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=824.0s)]
*  Damn, you're slacking. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=825.0s)]
*  You confused me. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=827.0s)]
*  No, it's this way. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=833.0s)]
*  It's like a times two. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=835.0s)]
*  Thank God I'm here to figure it out. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=838.0s)]
*  Yeah, see the line is the other way. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=839.0s)]
*  Is that what Mrs. is doing? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=845.0s)]
*  She's doing phone streams? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=849.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=853.0s)]
*  You want a pastry? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=855.0s)]
*  Kinda. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=857.0s)]
*  We don't have time. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=859.0s)]
*  So fuck you. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=860.0s)]
*  Thanks man. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=865.0s)]
*  We'll do a... [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=866.0s)]
*  Dude, you're my hero. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=869.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=870.0s)]
*  I love you so much. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=871.0s)]
*  Oh, nice to meet you. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=872.0s)]
*  Ian. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=873.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=874.0s)]
*  Loni. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=875.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=876.0s)]
*  I started watching you about a year and a half ago. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=877.0s)]
*  And changed my whole worldview and really opened me up to so many things. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=878.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=881.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=882.0s)]
*  You wanna take a photo? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=883.0s)]
*  That would be amazing. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=884.0s)]
*  Yeah, we just gotta rush right into the next thing. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=885.0s)]
*  I got you. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=886.0s)]
*  You're gonna do it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=887.0s)]
*  You're gonna do it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=888.0s)]
*  You're leaking soon, right? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=889.0s)]
*  Yeah, in a couple days. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=890.0s)]
*  Here. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=891.0s)]
*  You don't wanna be in it? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=892.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=893.0s)]
*  Okay, ready? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=896.0s)]
*  Three, two, one. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=897.0s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=899.0s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=900.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=901.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=902.0s)]
*  Have fun. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=903.0s)]
*  See y'all. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=904.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=905.0s)]
*  That was not a shrimp sniper. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=907.0s)]
*  It's just like randomly commuting in the morning. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=909.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=915.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was wholesome. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=916.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=917.0s)]
*  I'd be happier if I wasn't so... [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=919.0s)]
*  You're not daijouba? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=924.0s)]
*  Hungry. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=925.0s)]
*  You're not daijouba right now? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=926.0s)]
*  I'm just so hungry. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=927.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=928.0s)]
*  We'll get some fruits. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=929.0s)]
*  We'll get some Japanese fruits out of this. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=930.0s)]
*  Yeah, what happened to that? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=931.0s)]
*  Well, what happened to that is I thought, one, I don't wanna eat before I work out. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=932.0s)]
*  And two, we got a lot going on. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=938.0s)]
*  So twerking is a workout. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=942.0s)]
*  Twerking is a workout, yes, for sure. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=943.0s)]
*  How did this come about? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=948.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=953.0s)]
*  Kaho suggested it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=954.0s)]
*  I thought it was a great idea. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=955.0s)]
*  And then Ryan also suggested dancing. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=958.0s)]
*  I don't know what's happening with the... [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=960.0s)]
*  Is dancing a big part of Japanese culture, I guess? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=961.0s)]
*  I guess. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=965.0s)]
*  Wait, oh, this one. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=968.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's called the green circle. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=969.0s)]
*  That's how it happened. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=978.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=984.0s)]
*  Let me see what platform it's on. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=986.0s)]
*  Platform 5. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1009.0s)]
*  It's a Toyota. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1011.0s)]
*  Toyota's this way. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1012.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1019.0s)]
*  Yeah, so we're gonna twerk. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1034.0s)]

*  That is pretty gay. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1349.0s)]
*  That's why I haven't had sexo while I'm here. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1350.0s)]
*  Yeah, because we're straight as hell. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1353.0s)]

*  I do want to take the Shinkansen. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1374.0s)]
*  The Shinkansen doesn't go to Mount Fuji. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1376.0s)]
*  It's... oh, it doesn't? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1378.0s)]
*  You have to take a local train. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1380.0s)]
*  That's why it takes a while. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1381.0s)]
*  You can take the Shinkansen and you'll be there in 30 minutes. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1385.0s)]

*  You're right, I cannot read Kanji. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1415.0s)]
*  But honestly, a lot of Japanese people can't read Kanji out there. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1418.0s)]
*  That's not wrong. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1421.0s)]
*  I don't even know if this is the right exit, but... [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1423.0s)]
*  That's half the fun. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1439.0s)]

*  Okay. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1758.0s)]
*  Give us a draft. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1759.0s)]
*  Oh, it's the wrong one? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1760.0s)]
*  This way. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1761.0s)]
*  It's the wrong sound studio. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1763.0s)]
*  Happy rice, happy food. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1776.0s)]
*  Oh, this one. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1778.0s)]
*  No, I want to dance. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1779.0s)]
*  Dance. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1781.0s)]
*  It's extra cold. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1782.0s)]
*  What is happening today? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1783.0s)]
*  I thought it was a... [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1784.0s)]
*  Um, what brings you to Nippon Desu? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1787.0s)]
*  What brings you to Japan, Niss? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1791.0s)]
*  Oh, I wanted to chill. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1793.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1794.0s)]
*  I was bored. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1795.0s)]
*  I played too much World of Warcraft and I was exhausted. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1796.0s)]
*  Oh, so just like Wake? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1799.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1800.0s)]
*  I just had to get out of my house. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1801.0s)]
*  You needed to get out of there. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1802.0s)]
*  And Wake is thriving. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1803.0s)]
*  It smells great in here. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1805.0s)]
*  It does smell great in here. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1807.0s)]
*  Do you think they'll ever have streams so you can smell the stream? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1809.0s)]
*  Smell the vision stream. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1812.0s)]
*  What do you think Assan's would smell like? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1813.0s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1815.0s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be tough. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1818.0s)]
*  Who do you think would have the best smelling stream? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1819.0s)]
*  Me. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1821.0s)]
*  I was going to say Tina Kitten. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1822.0s)]
*  That's a good answer. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1824.0s)]
*  That's a great answer. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1825.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1826.0s)]
*  Wait, can you bring shoes? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1829.0s)]
*  These are the shoes. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1830.0s)]
*  Probably not allowed. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1831.0s)]
*  Oh, we can't wear outside shoes inside? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1832.0s)]
*  I guess we can, why not? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1834.0s)]
*  Nobody's watching. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1835.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1836.0s)]
*  A lot of people are watching. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1837.0s)]
*  So are you supposed to bring new shoes? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1839.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, like a record of the gym. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1841.0s)]
*  We have to go to the gym in Japan. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1842.0s)]
*  Oh, you have... [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1844.0s)]
*  There's gym specific shoes that don't touch the outside in Japan. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1845.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1848.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1849.0s)]
*  These are brand new, so it's perfect. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1850.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're walking around with them. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1852.0s)]
*  They touch the outside, they're soiled. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1853.0s)]
*  I didn't even do 10,000 steps there. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1855.0s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1857.0s)]
*  Americans live in squalor. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1858.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry about them, Cahoe. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1859.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1860.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't think that we would need inside shoes. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1861.0s)]
*  Oh, you didn't see my last message. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1863.0s)]
*  Because you're an animal. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1865.0s)]
*  No, no, I saw the message where you said bring gym shoes. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1866.0s)]
*  Oh, you wore the gym shoes. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1869.0s)]
*  And I thought, I wore the gym shoes. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1871.0s)]
*  I meant an extra pair, sorry. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1872.0s)]
*  Again, I'm so sorry about them. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1874.0s)]
*  Oh, it's okay. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1875.0s)]
*  Are you from Japan? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1876.0s)]
*  Yes, I'm from Tokyo. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1877.0s)]
*  What a bad. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1878.0s)]
*  Why'd you buy the bag? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1879.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1890.0s)]
*  We can't do that. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1891.0s)]
*  Just bring the... [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1901.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=1903.0s)]

*  Oh, this one? Yes. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9586.7s)]
*  Is that good? It's kind of pog. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9588.7s)]
*  That's the kind of content I have [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9592.7s)]
*  after seven years of just chatting. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9594.7s)]
*  Pog. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9596.7s)]
*  I called it. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9598.7s)]
*  I feel like we should. Yeah. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9600.7s)]
*  Me, me, yeah. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9602.7s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9604.7s)]
*  Okay. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9635.7s)]
*  And then afterwards... [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9638.7s)]
*  There's an option. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9640.7s)]
*  We'll go... we'll try to... [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9642.7s)]
*  We'll try to sit down somewhere and try it. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9644.7s)]
*  Try the different fruits. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9646.7s)]
*  Oh, you're gonna pet me? [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9648.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9650.7s)]
*  Somewhere to do like a taste test? [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9652.7s)]
*  There's nowhere to go to do it though, I don't think. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9654.7s)]
*  I'll just go back to my hotel probably. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9656.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9658.7s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, we'll be fine. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9668.7s)]
*  The heck? No, no, no, no. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9670.7s)]
*  We'll be fine. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9672.7s)]
*  She's 38. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9674.7s)]
*  Yeah, that is insane actually. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9676.7s)]

*  the bottom there [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9686.7s)]
*  with your fist. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9688.7s)]
*  You broke it with my thighs before. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9690.7s)]
*  What? [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9692.7s)]

*  she's just throwing it on me. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9766.7s)]
*  She's never seen an Italian [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9768.7s)]

*  I bring out a side of you that you don't usually have. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9800.7s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UmrcpTWak&t=9802.7s)]
