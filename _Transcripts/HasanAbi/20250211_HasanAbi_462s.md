# Trump Renamed The "Gulf Of Mexico" To The "Gulf Of America" | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8)
*  They've done it. Golf of America. Like, Pog. I'm Pogging right now. This is so sick. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=0.0s)]
*  In the... in the... Donald Trump is destroying this country paradigm. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  If I were to do a tier list of all the awful things that he's done, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=10.96s)]
*  this doesn't even make the first thing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=15.44s)]
*  ... [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=17.76s)]
*  Slammer post about the new naming of the golf. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=22.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, I saw this. This... I mean, this is just like... Dude, dude, dude. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=25.04s)]
*  If an American-owned application... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=29.36s)]
*  ... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=32.32s)]
*  ... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  This is low effort stuff, okay? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=38.8s)]
*  It's basically another demonstration that we have no motion. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=41.92s)]
*  We've lost it. You know? It's just like... This is what we're stoked on? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=47.36s)]
*  Oh my God. It's awesome. It's amazing. I can't believe... Like, who... [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=52.8s)]
*  Nobody cares. I don't understand it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=56.88s)]
*  I genuinely don't understand how significant move... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=60.0s)]
*  This is stuff Erdogan would do. It's true. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=63.28s)]
*  By the way, in Saudi, my Google Maps says golf of Mexico in parentheses golf of America. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think for outside of the... [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=69.92s)]
*  For outside of the United States of America, it still says golf of Mexico and in parentheses golf of America. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=73.92s)]
*  Erdogan is doing such ridiculous things. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=80.64s)]
*  Yo, yo. He does stuff like that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=82.56s)]
*  I work in the Gulf of Mexico and no one calls it the Gulf of America. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=84.32s)]
*  Like, this is some freedom fries shit, dude. That's what I mean. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=87.36s)]
*  This is like, oh yeah, we're gonna rename french fries to freedom fries. Like, who cares? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=90.64s)]
*  Like, even if this was... Here's my take, okay? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=96.72s)]
*  This is such no motion shit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=101.28s)]
*  Like, changing the name of golf of Mexico on Google Maps to golf of America [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=105.12s)]
*  is unimaginably low motion. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=112.48s)]
*  No motion whatsoever. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=116.0s)]
*  It is akin to when the American government decided to change the name of french fries [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=118.08s)]
*  to freedom fries for a brief moment only to take it back. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=123.2s)]
*  It just doesn't... Like, this doesn't impact anyone's lives at all. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=126.48s)]
*  It also, and this is perhaps a little bit surprising of me to say, it also is not unwarranted, okay? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=132.56s)]
*  It's one of the few instances where changing this from the Gulf of Mexico to golf of America [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=140.88s)]
*  is not like that insane of a demand, okay? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=146.48s)]
*  Listen to me on this one, okay? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=151.84s)]
*  One, the United States of America is not the only American country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=153.44s)]
*  It is literally the continent. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=158.4s)]
*  And there's also a shit ton of coastline on the Gulf of Mexico that the United States of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=160.4s)]
*  America also has. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=167.52s)]
*  So not only is it pointless, but it's also... [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=168.8s)]
*  It also genuinely is not like that insane, I guess. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=172.96s)]
*  You can say that the Gulf is surrounded by the continent of America. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=180.72s)]
*  So it's like, it's a very weird thing that the worst people are pointing to. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=181.28s)]
*  It's a very weird thing that the worst people are pointing to as like a massive victory [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=188.72s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=192.24s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  And ultimately, I think it's just not significant. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=193.76s)]
*  I don't know if this is truly... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=199.28s)]
*  Because whenever Trump does stuff like this, there are like the conspiracy blue and on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  liberals that'll be like, this is actually to make treaties void, or this is because [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=209.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to engage in drilling or whatever. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=213.6s)]
*  Like he didn't change the name to the Gulf of Trump, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=216.88s)]
*  As Fizz also said, it's correct. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=220.48s)]
*  It's like he changed the Gulf of America. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=222.8s)]
*  It's not like that crazy of a demand in general. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  And also it's basically just on Google Maps, which is an American... [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=229.12s)]
*  It's an American company. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  Don't forget the blast off. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=235.36s)]
*  I already did. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=236.24s)]
*  It's useless. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=236.96s)]
*  It's petty. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  And also simultaneously in a weird way, it's not like the worst thing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=240.0s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  Because like I said, this is the continent. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, this is the North American continent. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  And therefore it's valid to say it's the Gulf of America. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=256.88s)]
*  So it's one of those weird things that Trump did where I just don't care about it at all. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=262.24s)]
*  And I don't think it's all that significant. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=268.0s)]
*  I think ultimately the other stuff that he's doing is way worse. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=270.48s)]
*  You shut up right now, Law. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=276.16s)]
*  It's not the Gulf of the United States of America. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=278.16s)]
*  It's the Gulf of America. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  This must be so cool if you're a idiot. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=281.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's the other. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=283.68s)]
*  This is the correct take as well. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=285.04s)]
*  It's just like, it just is not... [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=286.8s)]
*  Like I think a part of the reason why, a part of the reason why Republicans really like this [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=290.16s)]
*  is because they're stupid and they think this matters. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=298.56s)]
*  They think this is like a massively consequential thing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=301.92s)]
*  Like it shows American dominance, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=304.88s)]
*  It's just a thing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=308.48s)]
*  It's not that significant. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  And it makes no sense to hype this up as though this is the best thing that's ever happened. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=312.88000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  They've done it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=320.48s)]
*  Gulf of America. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, pog. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=322.56s)]
*  I'm pogging right now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=323.36s)]
*  This is so sick. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is destroying this country paradigm. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  If I were to do a tier list of all the awful things that he's done, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=331.44000000000005s)]
*  this doesn't even make the first 50. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=335.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=339.2s)]
*  Do you see what I'm saying? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=339.76s)]
*  Like this does not crack the top 50 at all, especially because, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=342.16s)]
*  especially because if this was done in collaboration with like [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=347.76s)]
*  Mexico as well, and it wasn't Trump doing it, and it was like, hey, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=351.04s)]
*  in order to showcase our friendship, like, and the fact that we are on the same continent [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=355.04s)]
*  and we are incredibly important allies, like we are now switching the name of the Gulf of Mexico [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  in unison with the Mexican government to the Gulf of the Americas, something like that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=366.32s)]
*  Like most people would go, okay, that makes sense. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=371.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  Like in the past, in the past two weeks, we have not, in the past two weeks, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  it's about to be his first month in. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=383.76s)]
*  Donald Trump has done so much awful shit. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=386.64s)]
*  So much that it makes no sense to spend any time on this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=391.12s)]
*  Hassan, you're trying to explain change to a chat that at a meltdown, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=396.96s)]
*  when you change Mike cover colors, fair, true. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=399.52s)]
*  But yeah, this is all aesthetics. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=404.32s)]
*  Why would it be the Americas when it's just North America? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=407.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  Gulf of America is actually a decent naming convention for it as well, for the record. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=410.0s)]
*  But again, it's silly stuff. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=415.28s)]
*  It's low motion. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  He's an old white guy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=419.12s)]
*  Like most old white guys, he loves maps. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=420.08s)]
*  I think he sees changing the map in as many ways as possible. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  The last thing legacy he will have. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=424.24s)]
*  Obviously there are other reasons for Canada, Greenland and Panama, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=426.0s)]
*  but I think the hubris is another factor. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=428.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=430.72s)]
*  It's just like, it's just like a silly thing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=430.96s)]
*  It's low motion. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=433.2s)]
*  It's silly. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=434.56s)]
*  It's perfect for Donald Trump. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=435.76s)]
*  It's perfect red meat for his base that they can just like add on to all of the amazing [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=437.44s)]
*  things that our glorious president is doing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=443.68s)]
*  It's like fix the goddamn egg prices, man. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0p_qaCJL8&t=445.76s)]
