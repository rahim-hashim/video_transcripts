# Hasan's Trip To The Zoo With Maya
**HasanAbi:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI)
*  Look at that! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=0.0s)]
*  Yooo! [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2.0s)]
*  Oh my god, he's chilling so hard. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3.44s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  She said this is a mom and a baby. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6.44s)]
*  But a full-grown baby it looks like. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8.56s)]
*  Underwater they look like statues. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=14.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=16.72s)]
*  Oh, look at them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=19.6s)]
*  Oh, they're cuddling. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=21.84s)]
*  Aw, they're sleeping. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=22.92s)]
*  She loves her mommy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=24.88s)]
*  Wait, that's so cute. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=26.44s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=28.8s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=30.8s)]
*  Just don't change the mode. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=33.92s)]
*  Keep it on movie. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  And then... [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=36.16s)]
*  Do my eyes deceive me or is that you messing around? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=36.96s)]
*  What's going on, man? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=39.28s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=40.24s)]
*  It is I. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=40.72s)]
*  Um, hold on one second though. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=41.44s)]
*  We are currently experiencing some technical difficulties. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=42.84s)]
*  Alright, we're good. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=46.36s)]
*  We're back. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=46.92s)]
*  Audio? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  And also hopefully the audio is here too because it's in movie mode. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=47.84s)]
*  Yeah, I can hear sound working. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=51.24s)]
*  W sound. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=52.92s)]
*  Let's freaking go, baby. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=54.24s)]
*  W sound. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  This is just the zoom. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=57.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, this one. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=59.8s)]
*  Oh, I don't even know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=60.76s)]
*  I think that's just the lens. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=61.8s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't even touch that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=63.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna look it up. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=65.12s)]
*  Does that film too good? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=66.16s)]
*  Okay, W Maya. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=67.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=68.36s)]
*  Please start. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=68.84s)]
*  Someone say this trick doesn't work for you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=69.32s)]
*  We started already, but hi. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=70.8s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=72.6s)]
*  Nice to meet you guys. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=73.36s)]
*  Would it be okay if she got a picture? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=74.32s)]
*  Yeah, one second. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=75.6s)]
*  Let me just do the intro real quick. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=76.48s)]
*  Oh my god, we are... [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=78.28s)]
*  It's already started. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=79.4s)]
*  This really changed the... [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=80.24s)]
*  Is that better? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=82.2s)]
*  This really changed it a lot, I think. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=82.84s)]
*  Is that better? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=84.88s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=85.72s)]
*  Wait, why is it effing again? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  What happened? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  Boo. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=88.92s)]
*  It should be... [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=90.48s)]
*  Well, it's fine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  They're saying F, but I can still see it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  I know, it says we're back. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  We good. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=95.72s)]

*  We back, mini F. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  There's a terrible signal in the air. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=99.72s)]
*  Yeah, signal is kinda ass right now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=101.36s)]
*  Let me just do a quick check on something here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=104.16s)]
*  Interfaces are all on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, AT&T and Verizon. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=110.16s)]
*  Do we have audio? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=112.44s)]
*  I'll be honest, it's not great. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=113.68s)]
*  I'm gonna log on to mine as well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=116.88s)]
*  I'm gonna give it an extra boost. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=118.6s)]
*  Testing, talking. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=120.2s)]
*  Testing, talking. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=121.4s)]
*  Guys, it's been a while. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=122.6s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=123.56s)]
*  I haven't seen you in a few years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=124.28s)]
*  Except for yesterday, I guess. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=126.2s)]
*  But I wasn't looking at you yesterday, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=127.48s)]
*  so I don't know if that counts. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=128.8s)]
*  No, it could actually. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=129.88s)]
*  I don't wanna do that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=130.72s)]
*  No, it's, we're 5K. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=131.68s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=132.88s)]
*  It should be good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=133.72s)]
*  It just experienced a minor blip, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=134.56s)]
*  but we're back and we're good. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=136.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=138.0s)]

*  Hello. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=150.16s)]
*  We are here at the San Diego Zoo, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=151.04s)]
*  and I'm joined today on this wonderful broadcast [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=154.16s)]
*  with my friend who normally is not very interested [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=157.8s)]
*  in doing collaboration streams. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=161.24s)]
*  Maya Higa from Alvea Sanctuary. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=162.72s)]
*  Hello, everybody. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=164.52s)]
*  We're gonna be going up to some animals [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=165.68s)]
*  and I'm gonna try to touch them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=166.84s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=168.44s)]
*  I'm gonna try to pet. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=169.28s)]
*  You're not touching anything today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=170.12s)]
*  I'm gonna try to, I have two goals today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=170.96s)]
*  Find Mudeng. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=173.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=177.4s)]
*  It's a very good goal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=178.36s)]
*  It's an honorable goal. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=179.4s)]
*  Some might say it is the most honorable goal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=180.4s)]
*  And my second goal of the day is going to be to pet Mudeng. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  And my third goal, which is a secret one, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=186.84s)]
*  is going to be to kidnap Mudeng [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=188.8s)]
*  and bring him back home to my house [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  where he will be living the rest of his days [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=194.68s)]
*  as a happy hippo. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=196.8s)]
*  Mudeng, for those of you who don't know, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=198.72s)]
*  is a pygmy hippo. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=200.4s)]
*  Do they even have pygmy hippos here? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=201.24s)]
*  Do they? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  They have pygmy and... [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=204.6s)]
*  Okay, well that's bag secured. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=206.12s)]
*  Good luck, San Diego. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=208.28s)]
*  I will be stealing one of the pygmy hippos. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=209.44s)]
*  He's joking. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=211.68s)]
*  I'm not joking. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=213.52s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=214.56s)]
*  If given the opportunity, I would love to pet the hippo. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=215.4s)]
*  Anyway, that's it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=218.96s)]
*  And we have the wonderful Alvarez crew also with us. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=220.0s)]
*  They're just walking about. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=223.0s)]
*  They're just walking about. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=223.84s)]
*  I told them they could be on camera if they want to, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  but I don't think they want to be on camera. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=227.56s)]
*  We're also suspiciously, not so suspiciously, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=229.0s)]
*  surrounded by house and happy heads already, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  even though I was like, let's do this as a secret. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  This is, for the record, entirely, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  this, what we're doing today is entirely because of Maya. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=239.44s)]
*  I was not even gonna stream this morning, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=242.56s)]
*  so everybody say thank you, Maya, W. Maya. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=244.0s)]
*  Maya's got W. Aura. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=246.56s)]
*  She's got W. Hunger, okay? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=247.92s)]
*  She does. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=249.92s)]
*  She has W. Hunger and W. Aura. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=250.76s)]
*  Because this morning, I was supposed to be going back home. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=252.16s)]
*  At 5 p.m., I have Pacific time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  I obviously have my CNN, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=259.6s)]
*  the misinformation documentary reveal, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=262.12s)]
*  which I was supposed to live react to. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=265.04s)]
*  I had all this lined up, but then my cast, Fear and Crew, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=266.64s)]
*  were like, oh, we have a lot of stuff [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=272.6s)]
*  that we need to do here in San Diego. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  So I was like. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=275.68s)]
*  I hate all of those guys. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=276.52s)]
*  Me too. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  Especially Cutie Cinderella. Fancy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=278.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=279.72s)]
*  And then I was gonna not go. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=280.72s)]
*  I, and I was like, I'm just not even gonna stream. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=282.76s)]
*  I'm pissed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, I have to sit here and wait until 5 p.m. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=286.68s)]
*  to do the podcast that they weren't even ready for [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  or prepped for. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=291.68s)]
*  Anyway, and then Maya's like, what are you doing today? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=293.0s)]
*  And I was like, why, what's up? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=295.56s)]
*  And she's like, do you wanna collab? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=296.8s)]
*  And I was like, yes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=299.56s)]
*  So she is literally the reason why we're doing this today. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  I, this is my favorite zoo in the nation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=304.72s)]
*  San Diego Zoo, San Diego Safari Park. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance has the two of them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=309.0s)]
*  We're at the zoo today. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  The Safari Park is far away. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=313.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's like 40 minutes out. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  I've been here before. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=317.8s)]
*  I didn't go to the Safari Park. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=319.0s)]
*  I was trying to get us like a Safari Park situation as well. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=320.6s)]
*  I tried to get us like a private tour. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=325.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, they're super booked. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=327.58s)]
*  They're super busy today. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=329.8s)]
*  It's a beautiful day out here in San Diego. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  It is currently, yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=333.36s)]
*  It's like perfect zoo weather. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=335.16s)]
*  It's 78 degrees. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=336.92s)]
*  It's a little windy, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=338.88s)]
*  so it makes it nice and comfortable as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=339.82s)]
*  So I'm very excited to go. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=342.44s)]
*  And again, like I said, kidnap, moodang. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=344.48s)]
*  Or at least one of- [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=347.88s)]
*  You don't have a phone wrist holder, Leezer? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=348.72s)]
*  I don't. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=350.08s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not- [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=351.36s)]
*  I got you guys on lock. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=352.2s)]

*  You guys both have it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  Shout out to Connor Space and the rest of the Alveus crew [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=356.48s)]
*  for helping put this production together once again. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=359.8s)]
*  In last, it's totally last second. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=363.88s)]
*  So let's head inside. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=366.44s)]
*  What's not about all our tickets? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  I did buy all the tickets. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=369.32s)]
*  That was really nice. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=370.16s)]

*  Okay. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=372.72s)]
*  You wanna take the photos before we go in? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=373.56s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=375.48s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=376.32s)]
*  This is gonna be the last time this happens, I promise. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=377.16s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=378.6s)]

*  It's crazy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=385.88s)]
*  I hold things. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=388.72s)]
*  Oh, I'll do a set for Todd. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=392.76s)]

*  What's up? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=423.56s)]
*  Just a quick picture. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=424.40000000000003s)]

*  All right, have a good one, guys. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=430.58s)]
*  All right, we're finally doing it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=431.94s)]
*  We're finally doing the dang thing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  We're going inside. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=434.62s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=435.46s)]
*  We're going to the zoo. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=436.28s)]
*  Dude, I love the zoo. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=437.12s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=437.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=439.17999999999995s)]
*  I also love the zoo, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=440.02s)]
*  but this is not like any other zoo. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  You wanna explain to people, Maya, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  that what we're doing is not an unethical [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=444.9s)]
*  mode of consumption here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=447.78s)]
*  So people ask me that question all the time. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=449.34s)]
*  Number one, San Diego Zoo is obviously AZA. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=450.82s)]
*  So a certain of what they raise [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  goes directly into conservation efforts. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=456.18s)]
*  San Diego Zoo, though. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=458.1s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=459.42s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=460.26s)]
*  Hold for F. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=461.08s)]
*  Why the f... [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=461.92s)]
*  Is it... [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=462.76s)]
*  Why is it F-ing already? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=463.58s)]
*  Let's just move in. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=464.74s)]
*  It's gonna pick back up. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=466.02s)]
*  I think it's just like pinging from router to router. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=467.3s)]
*  I mean, there's four routers on there. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=470.54s)]
*  Some of them are AT&T, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=473.22s)]
*  some of them are Verizon. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=474.42s)]
*  It should be fine, though. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=475.38s)]
*  It's back. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=476.74s)]
*  AT&T is, yeah. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=477.58s)]
*  Can you guys hear now? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=479.9s)]
*  Shut. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=481.02s)]
*  Did you hear any of that? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=481.86s)]
*  Explain again. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=482.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=483.52s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=484.34000000000003s)]
*  You wanna just wander? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=485.18s)]
*  While it's working, you wanna give the intro, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=486.85999999999996s)]
*  and then we can go wherever you go. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=488.38s)]
*  You're the lead today. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=490.78s)]
*  We're letting women lead. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=493.38s)]
*  I'm a feminist. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=495.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  Just for today. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=497.53999999999996s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=498.38s)]
*  People ask me all the time, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=499.5s)]
*  what makes a zoo ethical? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=501.41999999999996s)]
*  How do you know if it's a bad zoo? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=502.38s)]
*  Et cetera, et cetera. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=503.29999999999995s)]
*  San Diego Zoo is obviously AZA accredited. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=504.14s)]
*  So Association of Zoos and Aquariums, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=506.85999999999996s)]
*  that means they're regulated [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=508.34s)]
*  for their animal welfare standards. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=509.56s)]
*  That means a portion of the money that they raise [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=510.74s)]
*  goes directly into conservation efforts. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=512.86s)]
*  San Diego Zoo goes way above and beyond [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=514.86s)]
*  in conservation efforts. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=518.46s)]
*  So they literally, you know California condors? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=519.3000000000001s)]
*  Like the huge bird? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=520.84s)]
*  Huge, okay, we'll see them today. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=522.54s)]
*  The huge bird? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=523.98s)]
*  The huge bird, condors. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=524.82s)]
*  Birds are scary. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=526.7s)]
*  Okay, so condors, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=527.74s)]
*  there were like 22 left in the wild, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=529.58s)]
*  They captured them. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  22? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=533.02s)]
*  22. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=533.84s)]
*  There's only 22 of them, shits? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  There was, listen to me. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=535.94s)]
*  Okay, I'm listening. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=537.82s)]
*  They captured them. Sorry, chef. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  They started a captive breeding program, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=540.5s)]
*  and San Diego Zoo has now made that population over 500. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=543.08s)]
*  They've released 500 of them. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=546.12s)]
*  That sounds weird when you say it like that though. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=546.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=548.9200000000001s)]
*  A captive breeding program. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=550.08s)]
*  Unless they like, do you think they enjoy? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=551.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, should they have let them die? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=552.72s)]
*  Do you think they enjoy the breeding program? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=554.24s)]
*  Or do you think they're like, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=557.08s)]
*  oh god, here we go again. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  They're like pandas. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=559.1600000000001s)]
*  You know how pandas hate the fuck? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=560.7s)]
*  Are they drinking AI, the condors? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=561.5400000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=563.4000000000001s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=564.24s)]
*  I think they're fine with it, Hassan. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  But thank you for your concern. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=566.88s)]
*  I was, yeah, I wanna make sure that it's ethical. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=568.2s)]
*  They're not. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=570.2800000000001s)]
*  It is ethical. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  They're not like, yo, you have to. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  And they're like, ugh. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=573.88s)]
*  It's a great life. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=574.72s)]
*  San Diego Zoo brought California condors [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=575.92s)]
*  back from extinction. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=577.72s)]
*  They're also working on bringing, which was it? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=579.36s)]
*  I always get the white and black rhinos mixed up. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  Southern, Northern. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  They're bringing a species of white rhino [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=585.3s)]
*  back from extinction as well. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=587.8s)]
*  They have a frozen zoo. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=590.36s)]
*  San Diego Zoo has a frozen zoo, which is- [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=591.8199999999999s)]
*  How is that even possible? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=593.28s)]
*  It's like 80 degrees right now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=594.64s)]
*  It's a zoo full of frozen sperm. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=596.36s)]
*  Oh, when you said frozen zoo, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=599.72s)]
*  I thought you meant like they just freeze that up. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=601.28s)]

*  of frozen sperm to maintain genetic diversity [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=607.44s)]
*  and to potentially bring back species [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=610.86s)]
*  if we have disasters, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=612.76s)]

*  Does that make sense to you guys? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=624.94s)]
*  Like a sperm bank? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=626.66s)]
*  Frozen sperm? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=627.5s)]

*  She's like, excuse me, are you Maya? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1444.36s)]
*  I'm like, no. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1445.9199999999998s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1446.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1447.76s)]
*  Come forward a little. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1448.6s)]
*  Do you wanna just like go up to the side here [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1449.44s)]
*  so you're not blocking anyone? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1450.52s)]
*  The zoom's not great, so I wanna be closer. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1451.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1453.08s)]
*  Damn, this is wild. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1454.08s)]
*  I just don't wanna be in anyone's way. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1455.12s)]
*  That's a rig right there. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1456.28s)]
*  That's a big setup. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1458.36s)]
*  Ratty Ambassadors presentation area. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1460.08s)]
*  Who do these animals think they are making us wait? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1464.76s)]
*  Chat. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1467.76s)]
*  I've seen this. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1468.6s)]
*  I've seen one of these presentations before. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1470.0s)]
*  Last time I was here, they brought out a kangaroo. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1471.84s)]
*  No, not a kangaroo rat. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1474.72s)]
*  No. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1475.56s)]
*  A giant pouch rat. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1476.3999999999999s)]
*  A what? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1477.6399999999999s)]
*  A giant pouch rat. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1478.48s)]
*  Like a rat, but it's like this big. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1479.4399999999998s)]
*  That's creepy. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1481.9199999999998s)]
*  So sick. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1483.0s)]
*  They detect minds. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1483.84s)]
*  They work for the government. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1486.48s)]
*  They detect minds? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1487.32s)]
*  They work for the government? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1489.44s)]
*  Welcome here to Wildlife Explorers Base Camp [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1491.76s)]
*  in our ratty presentation area. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1494.36s)]
*  My name is Casey. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1496.32s)]
*  How is everybody doing? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1497.24s)]
*  Woo! [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1498.8s)]
*  Ow. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1500.84s)]
*  Yeah, Casey. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1502.04s)]
*  Lower your expectations. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1503.24s)]
*  Okay, so I'm gonna be out here for about 10, 15 minutes, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1505.08s)]
*  kind of chatting about animals, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1508.16s)]
*  specifically about one animal [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1510.12s)]
*  who's coming out to visit with us today, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1511.6s)]
*  how we can kind of watch out for them conservation-wise. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1513.72s)]
*  I will probably ask you all to participate [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1516.52s)]
*  and maybe answer some of my questions [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1519.28s)]
*  if you know the answers. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1521.6399999999999s)]
*  I will probably answer your questions if you have any. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1523.04s)]
*  I will do my best to answer them. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1525.8799999999999s)]
*  As she comes around the corner, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1528.44s)]
*  I'm sure there's gonna be lots of people who know [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1530.4s)]
*  what kind of animal ambassador [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1533.08s)]
*  is coming around the corner over here. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1534.6s)]
*  Oh, he's so big. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1536.4s)]
*  What is it? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1537.6s)]
*  Sloth. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1539.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1540.0s)]
*  How'd you guys know? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1541.48s)]
*  Cause she's so slow, right? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  All right, so here's my tricky question. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1546.8s)]
*  There are six pieces of sloths altogether. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1549.08s)]
*  Is she a two-toed or a three-toed sloth? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1551.36s)]
*  Two-toed. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1554.56s)]
*  Three? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1556.3999999999999s)]
*  How many think she's a three-toed sloth? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1557.84s)]
*  You guys are wrong. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1559.7199999999998s)]
*  How many think she's a two-toed sloth? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1560.56s)]
*  Ooh, most of you. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1562.9599999999998s)]
*  How many of you didn't vote [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1564.0s)]
*  cause you thought you'd get it wrong? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1565.1999999999998s)]
*  One of you, thank you very much. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1567.08s)]
*  She is a two-toed sloth, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1568.4399999999998s)]
*  specifically a Linaise two-toed sloth. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1570.56s)]
*  And the way you can tell the difference [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1573.52s)]
*  is by counting their front toenails. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1574.8799999999999s)]
*  So every sloth in the world [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1577.8799999999999s)]
*  is gonna have three toenails on their back. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1579.24s)]
*  And then you have to look at their front [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1581.52s)]
*  to tell the difference between a two-toed or a three-toed. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1582.68s)]
*  So she is a two-toed sloth there. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1585.0s)]
*  There are two species of two-toed sloths [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1587.16s)]
*  and four species of three-toed sloths. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1589.84s)]
*  Toed. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1593.4s)]
*  That sounds so weird. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1594.24s)]
*  Toed. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1595.28s)]
*  She is one of the largest species of sloths there is. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1596.12s)]
*  She weighs in today at about 10 kilograms, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1598.48s)]
*  which for those of us who live here in California, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1601.56s)]
*  that is about 20 pounds, 22 pounds, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1603.4s)]
*  give or take a little bit. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1606.6s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1607.76s)]
*  So she is the larger side of the species of sloth [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1608.6s)]
*  and she is a wonderful example of a female, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1611.96s)]
*  which tend to be a little bit smaller in size [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1614.32s)]
*  than their male counterparts. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1617.1200000000001s)]
*  You think we can take that one? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1618.72s)]
*  But really the size difference is pretty small. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1619.56s)]
*  No. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1621.16s)]
*  So you'll never be able to guess [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1622.0s)]
*  just by looking at them if they're male or female. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1622.82s)]
*  Take it home with me maybe. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1624.92s)]
*  All right, let's go for another one here you guys. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1626.04s)]
*  How many of you, no let's do this one. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1629.1599999999999s)]
*  Who thinks her best sense is her eyesight? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1631.08s)]
*  Nobody, what's her best sense? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1634.4399999999998s)]
*  Smell. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1636.36s)]
*  Smell, how do you know that? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1637.2s)]
*  God damn, I got it right. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1638.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1639.56s)]
*  Because the size of her nose, right? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1640.72s)]
*  Usually you can guess the best sense an animal has [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1643.36s)]
*  by looking at the size and shape [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1646.9199999999998s)]
*  of their different features. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1648.6s)]
*  I got it right. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1649.4399999999998s)]
*  So owls with giant big eyes have really good eyesight. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1650.28s)]
*  This sloth here with these teeny tiny little eyes, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1654.4399999999998s)]
*  you might even have a hard time finding them [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1657.22s)]
*  because they're so small, have really poor eyesight. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1658.98s)]
*  But she's got that big nose and just like dogs, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1662.7s)]
*  her nose is often wet. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1666.14s)]
*  Wet smells are easier to tell the difference [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1668.26s)]
*  between them dry smells. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1671.42s)]
*  So having that wet nose helps her smell [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1672.74s)]
*  and finding around her. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1675.5s)]
*  Now it's okay for her to have really poor eyesight [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1677.66s)]
*  because what does she eat? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1679.82s)]
*  Leaves. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1681.3s)]
*  Leaves. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1682.14s)]
*  Leaves, thank you, thank you. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1682.98s)]
*  She lives in a tree. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1684.06s)]
*  And she eats leaves. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1686.66s)]
*  There is no hunting involved. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1688.0600000000002s)]
*  There's not really any foraging involved. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1689.98s)]
*  She literally will just reach out, grab a branch, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1691.98s)]
*  pull it close to her and start munching. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1694.9s)]
*  That is how much she has to cut into finding her food. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1697.0600000000002s)]
*  So she doesn't have to look for it, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1700.5s)]
*  but she can definitely smell where it's going. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1702.0600000000002s)]
*  And she can smell if she wants to change [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1704.98s)]
*  the type of tree that she's in. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1707.14s)]
*  So she will eat a variety of different tree parts. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1708.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1711.9s)]
*  Or different types of trees. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1712.74s)]
*  Look at her go. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1714.18s)]
*  Leaves, the flowers, the shoots. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1715.18s)]
*  She might even eat a couple of bugs that are on the leaves. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1717.9s)]
*  Occasionally she might come across a bird's nest [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1721.5s)]
*  and eat a bird egg. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1724.3s)]
*  Not a normal thing, but opportunistically if it comes up. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1726.34s)]
*  Xena over here is eating what? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1729.86s)]
*  What is she eating you guys? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1731.3799999999999s)]
*  Lettuce. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1732.22s)]
*  Lettuce, yeah. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1733.22s)]
*  Lettuce is a great way for her to get all the water [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1734.26s)]
*  that she needs. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1736.74s)]
*  And she's gonna get a variety of different types of lettuce [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1738.02s)]
*  today at Iceberg. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1740.62s)]
*  It's falling on her face. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1741.9s)]
*  It might be kale, it might be cabbage. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1742.74s)]
*  All different types of greens. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1744.38s)]
*  What else is she eating? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1746.1000000000001s)]
*  What else can you see here? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1746.94s)]
*  Oh my God, oh my God. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1747.7800000000002s)]
*  Oh no, she's dropping the lettuce. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1748.8200000000002s)]
*  She's dropping the lettuce. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1751.2600000000002s)]
*  It's one of her favorite little treats to have. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1752.74s)]
*  She also gets things like root vegetables, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1755.42s)]
*  sweet potato or jicama and lots of other veggies [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1757.5800000000002s)]
*  because we don't have a rainforest [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1760.5800000000002s)]
*  that grows here in San Diego. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1762.8200000000002s)]
*  So we can't go over and just cut leaves down [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1764.66s)]
*  for her out of a tree. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1766.8200000000002s)]
*  So our diet team works with our nutritionists [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1768.22s)]
*  and they come up with a diet of fruits and vegetables [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1770.5s)]
*  and greens that fulfill all of her needs nutritionally [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1773.78s)]
*  rather than us having to get tree parts for her to eat. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1777.1399999999999s)]
*  She's so good, she's like, I had enough. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1779.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, he's in there. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1780.9399999999998s)]
*  She's like, I'm good, I'm good on the lettuce. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1781.78s)]
*  Do you have a question, kiddo? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1783.58s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1784.4199999999998s)]
*  Why didn't she eat it all, did you ask that? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1785.26s)]
*  She's so good, she's so beautiful. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1786.6999999999998s)]
*  Guess what, she's what's known as a drop feeder. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1789.1399999999999s)]
*  And a drop feeder plays a very important role [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1791.82s)]
*  in the areas of the forested, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1794.58s)]
*  I mean specifically the rainforest for her. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1796.54s)]
*  But drop feeders are things like swaths, monkeys, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1799.74s)]
*  porcupines, they're animals that will eat [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1803.58s)]
*  a certain amount of food [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1806.34s)]
*  and then they'll drop it on the ground. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1807.82s)]
*  And sometimes they can be just that dramatic. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1809.66s)]
*  They're like, ugh, done. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1811.34s)]
*  But that is really helpful for smaller animals [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1813.66s)]
*  who live on the forest floors [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1816.1s)]
*  because now there's all these little bits of food around [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1817.78s)]
*  for them to find and eat. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1820.38s)]
*  Now I just want to preface this really quickly [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1822.86s)]
*  because I'm going to keep talking, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1824.86s)]
*  but Xena when she's finished is just going to go back [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1826.22s)]
*  to her crate and be like, I'm all done, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1829.14s)]
*  I've had enough sunlight, bye bye. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1830.94s)]
*  So if she leaves you guys, that is her choice, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1832.5800000000002s)]
*  but I'm going to stay out here and chit chat [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1835.0600000000002s)]
*  and talk some more just so you all know. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1836.7s)]
*  Okay, so let's see, what was I talking about? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1839.3000000000002s)]
*  She's leaving us. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1840.9s)]
*  I was talking about rainforest [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1841.74s)]
*  and how we don't have a rainforest here in California [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1842.5800000000002s)]
*  so we can't just cut down trees. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1845.18s)]
*  Guess what the biggest threat to sloths [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1847.1000000000001s)]
*  that live in the rainforest is? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1849.7s)]
*  Deforestation. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1851.26s)]
*  See, oh my goodness, thank you. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1852.1000000000001s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1853.94s)]
*  This is the biggest threat to sloths [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1854.7800000000002s)]
*  and many other animals. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1855.8600000000001s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1857.7s)]
*  That's why we don't want to go out [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1858.54s)]
*  and cut down tree parts. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1859.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm a conservationist, people know me in these circles. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1860.5s)]
*  We're full of a rainforest and making it different. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1863.74s)]
*  12 kids in front of me. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1866.46s)]
*  If there's anything you guys take away from today, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1867.3s)]
*  start talking about products that are sustainable. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1869.94s)]
*  And kids, I know that's a tough one, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1872.86s)]
*  but right now there's not a requirement for wood products, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1874.78s)]
*  building materials, furnitures. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1878.94s)]
*  We need to start talking about that more and more [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1881.5s)]
*  as a group, as a public. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1883.54s)]
*  There are many sustainably sourced products out there, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1885.42s)]
*  but it is not a regulation or a requirement now. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1888.7800000000002s)]
*  So if we talk about it more and more, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1890.98s)]
*  it's gonna become standard. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1892.7800000000002s)]
*  Just like things like palm oil is a really big one. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1894.8600000000001s)]
*  I bet you guys have all heard of palm oil [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1897.6200000000001s)]
*  and how bad it is for the orangutans [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1899.14s)]
*  and many other animals. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1900.66s)]
*  And poo. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1901.5s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1902.38s)]
*  Boo. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1903.42s)]
*  So palm oil is a big one. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1904.2600000000002s)]
*  And now you can go to a grocery store with your phone, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1905.5400000000002s)]
*  scan a product and it'll tell you whether that has palm oil [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1907.8200000000002s)]
*  that was sourced sustainably or not, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1910.9s)]
*  or if it has palm oil at all. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1913.2600000000002s)]
*  So we want that to become the standard. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1915.06s)]
*  And the way we do that is by talking with one another [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1917.02s)]
*  and reminding one another to get to that. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1920.3s)]
*  Now I could keep talking all day long, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1922.6599999999999s)]
*  but I wanna see if you guys have any questions. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1924.94s)]
*  What's your question? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1926.94s)]
*  How do sloths turn around? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1928.7s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1930.1s)]
*  So she's got a couple of ways to turn around. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1931.7s)]
*  Silly question kid. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1933.02s)]
*  The first one is very, very slowly [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1934.1799999999998s)]
*  where she reaches behind her. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1936.82s)]
*  I'm destroying these children in the marketplace of ideas. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1939.1s)]
*  Chats keeping. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1941.4199999999998s)]
*  She's very, very flexible. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1942.26s)]
*  Chats keeping tabs. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1943.1s)]
*  Put her body up into a ball and touch between her toes [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1944.26s)]
*  and grab a branch over there. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1948.22s)]
*  So she can turn over by doing a little front flip [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1949.3s)]
*  or a somersault. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1951.3s)]
*  Very flexible, very strange animals. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1952.14s)]
*  Great question. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1955.38s)]
*  Directly feeding. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1956.22s)]
*  What's your question? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1957.06s)]
*  Whoa, I couldn't hear that one. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1958.06s)]
*  Say it one more time for me. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1959.02s)]
*  How do we help them smell their food? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1961.54s)]
*  Ooh, that's a great one. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1963.6200000000001s)]
*  How do we help them smell their food? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1964.54s)]
*  I don't think that's a great one. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1966.02s)]
*  I knew this one. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1967.18s)]
*  I missed that one. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1970.38s)]
*  So how do we help them smell their food? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1971.38s)]
*  A lot of it is because we keep their habitat very humid. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1973.1399999999999s)]
*  We have misters that are in their habitat [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1976.4599999999998s)]
*  and we have live plants that grow in their habitat. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1979.1799999999998s)]
*  What? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1982.06s)]
*  And then she will lick her own nose to get it all wet [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1982.8999999999999s)]
*  and that's how she's able to smell all of the food [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1986.1399999999999s)]
*  that's hidden around her home. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1988.82s)]
*  And we do kind of hide her food around her home [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1990.1399999999999s)]
*  because we want her to be able to forage [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1992.98s)]
*  and find what she wants. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1994.62s)]
*  Great question. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1996.26s)]
*  What if she wears an adorable flamingo shirt? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1997.1s)]
*  What do they do if they come out of the tree? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=1999.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really great question. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2004.6999999999998s)]
*  Does anybody know a reason why a sloth [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2007.26s)]
*  would come out of the tree? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2009.3799999999999s)]
*  To get food, but she eats leaves, right? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2010.86s)]
*  So she's getting all the food she needs [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2013.34s)]
*  from the trees that she's in. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2014.9399999999998s)]
*  Silly kids, leaves are on trees. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2015.78s)]
*  So there's one reason a sloth is gonna come down [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2017.98s)]
*  out of a tree and that's to go to the bathroom. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2019.62s)]
*  Oh, I thought predators. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2022.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's super, super weird [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2023.4199999999998s)]
*  because she doesn't wanna sit up in a tree [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2024.8999999999999s)]
*  and go to the bathroom [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2026.58s)]
*  because it would leave a set trail [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2027.46s)]
*  for all of her predators like jaguars and ocelots. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2028.66s)]
*  And they'd be like, oh, there's a sloth right there. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2031.5800000000002s)]
*  So what they do is really, really strange. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2034.42s)]
*  They actually don't go to the bathroom [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2036.46s)]
*  for up to seven to 10 days at a time. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2038.42s)]
*  They hold everything, solids and liquids, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2041.46s)]
*  for up to 10 days. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2044.66s)]
*  And at the end of that seven to 10 days, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2046.5800000000002s)]
*  she will climb down to the bottom of the tree, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2048.7000000000003s)]
*  go to the bathroom, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2051.3s)]
*  and then she'll lose up to 10% of her body weight, right? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2052.78s)]
*  So 22 pounds, she can lose up to two pounds in one event. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2056.1s)]
*  Girls don't poop. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2061.2999999999997s)]
*  20%, four pounds, up to four pounds right there. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2062.14s)]
*  And then she's gonna move very, very quickly. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2064.94s)]
*  That's how I feel after eating a California burrito. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2066.94s)]
*  Away from that pile of smelly stuff, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2069.34s)]
*  go over to this tree and then climb up this tree [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2071.34s)]
*  and hide over here so that any predator who finds this [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2073.9s)]
*  goes, where's the sloth? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2076.86s)]
*  I can't find it. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2078.06s)]
*  That's why she does that. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2079.5s)]
*  And that's what happens when she goes around. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2080.5s)]
*  She's very, very vulnerable on the ground. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2082.86s)]
*  She cannot move very quickly. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2084.9s)]
*  She has to crawl one arm over another [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2086.9s)]
*  in order for her to move on the ground. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2090.6600000000003s)]
*  Another big thing about deforestation, you guys, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2093.6s)]
*  if she can't reach a tree quickly, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2096.06s)]
*  she's climbing across a road, very, very dangerous for them. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2097.7400000000002s)]
*  So another reason for us to be aware [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2101.3s)]
*  of sustainably sourced wood products. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2103.26s)]
*  Excellent question, go ahead. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2105.54s)]
*  Why is she hanging on a tree? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2108.86s)]
*  Oh, why does she eat while she hangs in the tree? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2111.94s)]
*  Great, great question. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2114.02s)]
*  Everything hanging upside down in a tree. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2115.06s)]
*  Sloths are designed to play hide and seek [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2118.3s)]
*  like nobody else in the world. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2120.86s)]
*  She spends all of her time hiding in a tree [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2123.18s)]
*  from her big predators, jaguars, ocelots, snakes, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2126.4s)]
*  alligators. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2129.94s)]
*  She's assaulting me because she's worried [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2131.34s)]
*  I got a conservation cloud. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2134.62s)]
*  So she's gonna be hiding in a tree [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2136.1s)]
*  and her toenails are designed kind of like a hanger hook. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2137.78s)]
*  You know how you put your clothes on hangers [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2141.3s)]
*  and you hang them in the closet [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2142.7s)]
*  and they hang there forever, right? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2144.06s)]
*  Unless you take them down. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2145.7s)]
*  That is how her toenails work. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2147.22s)]
*  So they hold her in a tree, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2149.2999999999997s)]
*  she doesn't have to flex any muscles. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2150.2999999999997s)]
*  She doesn't have to think about holding on. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2152.04s)]
*  She just holds on. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2153.98s)]
*  Her body instinctively holds on. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2155.5s)]
*  If you guys climbed a tree and fell asleep, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2159.02s)]
*  what would happen? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2161.14s)]
*  We'd fall. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2162.58s)]
*  You'd fall, absolutely. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2163.4199999999996s)]
*  You'd fall out of the tree, you hit your head. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2164.5s)]
*  I'm destroying these kids. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2166.02s)]
*  That was a really bad idea. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2166.8599999999997s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2167.7s)]
*  If she falls asleep, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2168.52s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2169.62s)]
*  Her body continues to hold on. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2170.46s)]
*  She's impressed. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2172.82s)]
*  So she has no reason to think about it. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2173.6600000000003s)]
*  So it's easiest for her to eat upside down in the tree [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2175.1000000000004s)]
*  than any other way. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2178.6200000000003s)]
*  That was a great question. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2180.5s)]
*  She's impressed with the kids. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2181.34s)]
*  The kids are so impressed with my knowledge. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2182.1600000000003s)]
*  Did I tell you her name? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2184.34s)]
*  This is Zina. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2185.5800000000004s)]
*  Zina is a two-toed sloth. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2186.7000000000003s)]
*  She's named Zina not after the warrior princess, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2188.7400000000002s)]
*  for those of you that are old enough. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2191.7000000000003s)]
*  She's named Zina because she comes from the family group [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2193.6200000000003s)]
*  Zinarsra, which is a really fun name. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2196.46s)]
*  I knew that, but I didn't wanna say it. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2198.98s)]
*  And anteaters. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2201.34s)]
*  So she's related to anteaters or her animal cousins. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2202.3s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2205.94s)]
*  How do they go up and down the tree? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2207.06s)]
*  How do they hang upside down? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2209.1800000000003s)]
*  It's their toenails. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2210.76s)]
*  And the way their muscles are designed [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2212.26s)]
*  is just like a hanger. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2214.34s)]
*  If you put clothes on your hanger, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2215.54s)]
*  a big winter coat, not here in San Diego. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2216.82s)]
*  But if you put it in a closet [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2219.86s)]
*  and it just hangs that little hook motion, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2221.02s)]
*  that's how she hangs upside down. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2223.38s)]
*  It's her hooks make it really easy [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2225.06s)]
*  for her to hang on to things. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2227.1400000000003s)]
*  Great question. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2229.26s)]
*  Any other questions about Zina? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2230.18s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2231.5s)]
*  How do they climb up and down the tree? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2234.46s)]
*  Because the face of a tree is really big, right? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2236.1s)]
*  And the branches of the trees are much smaller and easier. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2239.46s)]
*  So she's got a ridiculous amount of arm strength. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2242.52s)]
*  They are surprisingly, you would never think about sloths [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2246.8599999999997s)]
*  as having a lot of energy and being able to fight, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2249.62s)]
*  but they're very strong. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2251.7799999999997s)]
*  So she can actually hold around a tree [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2253.06s)]
*  and then climb down the tree that way. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2257.04s)]
*  Trees have a lot of long branches that hang [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2260.06s)]
*  and drip down over the ground. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2262.7s)]
*  So she can actually climb down those branches as well. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2264.74s)]
*  They've actually seen sloths drinking from riverways [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2267.9199999999996s)]
*  or ponds hanging upside down. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2271.24s)]
*  And she's got a little notch in her toenails. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2273.9199999999996s)]
*  She can scoop up water and then lick the water [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2276.5s)]
*  with her tongue from her toenails. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2279.2599999999998s)]
*  So she'll drink fresh water out of a lake or stream [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2281.02s)]
*  by climbing down onto the ends of the branches. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2283.5s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2286.3799999999997s)]
*  What's the life expectancy of a sloth? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2287.58s)]
*  Such a great question. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2289.94s)]
*  What's the life expectancy of a sloth? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2290.86s)]
*  It's really hard to know because [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2292.66s)]
*  I'm so brave. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2294.86s)]
*  It's hard to find sloths in the wild. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2295.7799999999997s)]
*  They're really good at playing hide and seek, right? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2297.3s)]
*  So the average estimation for a sloth [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2299.48s)]
*  is about 10 to 12 years, give or take a little bit. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2301.74s)]
*  In human care where they have no predators [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2306.68s)]
*  and we're providing them their food and their diet, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2309.34s)]
*  average is closer to 20 years. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2311.7799999999997s)]
*  I have known sloths that have lived into their 40s. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2314.3s)]
*  So a really long time. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2317.82s)]
*  But predators in the rainforest [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2320.18s)]
*  are really a big deal for them. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2321.86s)]
*  So it will probably be much shorter in the rainforest [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2323.3s)]
*  than here in human care. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2327.1s)]
*  One of their favorite predators I haven't spoken about yet [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2328.84s)]
*  is the harpy eagle. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2331.74s)]
*  Have you guys ever heard of the harpy eagle? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2333.3s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2335.54s)]
*  We have one here at the San Diego Zoo. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2336.38s)]
*  If you guys wanna check it out. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2337.82s)]
*  It's on the other side of the zoo. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2338.66s)]
*  But they are this tall. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2341.5s)]
*  If they were standing right here, this tall [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2343.3s)]
*  and can pull a 20 pound sloth out of a tree. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2345.94s)]
*  Did you see that picture? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2348.46s)]
*  So she literally has predators coming from all around her [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2349.3s)]
*  in all directions. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2352.26s)]
*  That's why she's so good at hide and seek. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2353.1000000000004s)]
*  That's an op for the sloths. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2355.6200000000003s)]
*  Are sloths good mothers? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2357.86s)]
*  That's a great, great question. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2359.1800000000003s)]
*  If your standard is that you raise your children [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2360.94s)]
*  for 18 years before kicking them out with a college degree, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2363.3s)]
*  no, they're not. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2367.38s)]
*  But they are good mothers and protective [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2368.98s)]
*  of one baby at a time for about six to 12 months. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2370.78s)]
*  Six to 12 months. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2374.98s)]
*  After that, they're done being two. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2375.82s)]
*  Six to 12 months is all baby gets to grow up. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2378.0600000000004s)]
*  Mom will hold baby on her belly [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2381.1400000000003s)]
*  and mom will continue to do all of the things [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2383.46s)]
*  that mom usually does. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2385.34s)]
*  She eats and sleeps and drinks in the trees. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2386.6600000000003s)]
*  She'll carry baby on her stomach down [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2391.02s)]
*  and she goes to the bathroom. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2393.1400000000003s)]
*  And baby learns all of the things from mom [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2394.7000000000003s)]
*  in those six to 12 months. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2397.5600000000004s)]
*  Mom will also mash food in her mouth [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2399.7200000000003s)]
*  and drip gross saliva-y food to baby to eat. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2403.14s)]
*  So, I mean, that's a good mother, right? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2407.9s)]
*  Here's some saliva for you to eat and learn how to eat. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2409.74s)]
*  So, yes, she's very good at mothering for a short time. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2413.14s)]
*  I actually worked with a sloth [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2417.8599999999997s)]
*  and he was bigger than Zena is. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2419.18s)]
*  And he is about 25 pounds. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2422.02s)]
*  So bigger than his mom. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2424.74s)]
*  And at a year old was still trying to climb onto her belly [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2426.5s)]
*  like he wanted her to carry him. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2429.5s)]
*  And she was like, I'm all done with you. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2431.56s)]
*  And actually started to push him away and shove him. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2433.84s)]
*  So we had to separate them because he was too big for her. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2437.7999999999997s)]
*  He's just enough. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2441.2s)]
*  Great question. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2443.48s)]
*  Okay, so you guys, I will talk forever, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2444.36s)]
*  especially about sloths, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2446.96s)]

*  Just didn't give out any information [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=2911.9s)]

*  Wow. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3031.94s)]

*  All right, guys. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3035.3s)]
*  So I couldn't, I can't film the staff. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3036.14s)]
*  So yeah, they're very careful in regards to media. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3038.54s)]
*  So about any of their staff speaking. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3043.14s)]
*  So I shouldn't have filmed her saying the thought thing. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3046.62s)]
*  Right, the reason that they were concerned [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3049.3s)]
*  is one because of the kids, I think, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3051.34s)]
*  and two because she was presenting [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3052.62s)]
*  and they want that run through their PR, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3055.5s)]
*  which makes sense, it's fine. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3056.94s)]
*  Maybe if someone wasn't so tall, they wouldn't have noticed. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3060.06s)]
*  Yeah, Nick was in here. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3064.34s)]
*  He was filming everything up and down. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3065.18s)]
*  They didn't give him anything. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3066.7400000000002s)]
*  They didn't give him any problems. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3068.9s)]
*  If there's a bathroom anywhere near here, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3070.86s)]
*  I would like to pop in there real quick. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3073.86s)]
*  There should be one over here. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3076.42s)]
*  No, it actually, the San Diego Zoo [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3077.42s)]
*  does a really, really good job with education. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3079.18s)]
*  Oh, it's a, oh, she got a bubbler. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3081.94s)]
*  They wanna make sure that nothing goes out, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3084.42s)]
*  that they're not like 100% confident in, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3085.82s)]
*  which I think is totally valid. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3087.42s)]
*  They don't wanna slander in the animals [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3088.82s)]
*  and be like, yo, this one's ugly. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3090.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3091.9s)]
*  It's such a funny thing. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3093.54s)]
*  Like what misinformation people spread about animals. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3094.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3098.7s)]

*  that they were going to therapy because they wanted about it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3323.14s)]
*  No, but I like watching both of your videos. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3325.42s)]
*  He's slandering. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3326.7000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3327.9s)]
*  I saw the notification and I was like, no shot. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3328.7400000000002s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3330.78s)]
*  Yeah, have a good day. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3331.62s)]
*  You too. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3332.46s)]
*  Remember there was a girl that said that she started [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3334.42s)]
*  going to therapy after Wine About It? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3336.14s)]
*  Oh my God, you're right. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3337.82s)]
*  And then I was like, yeah, you watch for your end [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3338.66s)]
*  to balance it out. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3341.94s)]
*  It like messes up your mental health. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3342.78s)]
*  No, she didn't go because- [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3345.14s)]
*  Oh, it's right here. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3346.58s)]
*  She didn't go to therapy because of Wine About It. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3347.42s)]
*  No, no, no, she said- [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3349.26s)]
*  She started going because we talked about therapy. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3350.1s)]
*  No, that's what I mean. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3352.06s)]
*  Oh. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3353.1s)]
*  Okay, so I'm going to pee. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3355.1s)]
*  We're going to come over here [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3355.94s)]
*  and I'm going to anxiously and rapidly tell you guys [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3356.76s)]
*  everything that I love about this zoo. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3359.62s)]
*  I don't want to be banned either. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3361.5s)]
*  All right, all right. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3363.26s)]
*  So I said this at the beginning of the stream. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3365.78s)]
*  So if you guys weren't here, I'm going to say it again. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3367.98s)]
*  A lot of times people ask me about what makes an ethical zoo [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3370.9s)]
*  or what's a good zoo, what's a bad zoo, stuff like that. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3374.82s)]
*  San Diego Zoo is genuinely, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3377.26s)]
*  and I said this at the beginning of the stream, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3378.78s)]
*  is my favorite zoo in the nation. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3380.38s)]
*  They're AZA accredited. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3382.62s)]
*  So Association of Zoos and Aquariums, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3384.2s)]
*  which means that they're regulated [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3386.08s)]
*  for their animal welfare standards. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3387.68s)]
*  It also means that part of the money that they make [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3388.7599999999998s)]
*  goes into conservation efforts. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3391.08s)]
*  But San Diego Zoo is like next level [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3392.2799999999997s)]
*  on conservation efforts. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3395.48s)]
*  Great job. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3396.7999999999997s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3397.64s)]
*  So one of the examples I said this morning [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3398.46s)]
*  is the California Condor, big bird. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3401.72s)]
*  We're going to see them today. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3404.3399999999997s)]
*  They're so cool. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3405.2s)]
*  At one point there were 22 of them left in the wild. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3406.7999999999997s)]
*  San Diego Zoo was able to bring those birds [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3410.24s)]
*  in the captivity and do a breeding program in captivity. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3412.16s)]
*  And they've released 500 of them, which is incredible. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3414.92s)]
*  So they're doing incredible work. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3420.7999999999997s)]
*  They've literally brought back a species. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3423.12s)]
*  They have a frozen zoo, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3425.04s)]
*  which is a giant frozen sperm bank [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3426.3599999999997s)]
*  of a bunch of different semen [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3429.2s)]
*  so that they can maintain genetic diversity in captivity [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3432.16s)]
*  and bring back more species. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3435.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm obviously not a representative of the zoo, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3436.48s)]
*  but this is all stuff that I've learned here. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3438.24s)]
*  I've been here like probably like seven or eight times. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3439.56s)]
*  So they're a hundred years old. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3442.72s)]
*  They're huge. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3445.4s)]
*  There's the San Diego Zoo here and there's the Safari Park. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3446.68s)]
*  If you guys are in the U.S. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3449.68s)]
*  if it was like, my, I can go to one zoo. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3450.92s)]
*  What is it? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3452.7999999999997s)]
*  I would say San Diego. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3453.72s)]
*  So they set the standard. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3455.52s)]
*  They set the standard. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3457.64s)]
*  Thank you for listening. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3460.56s)]
*  Don't ban us. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3462.2s)]
*  Good stuff. Good stuff. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3465.72s)]
*  How's it going so far guys? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3466.84s)]
*  Did you like the sloth? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3468.68s)]
*  I liked when she ate corn. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3469.7999999999997s)]
*  It was nice as they let that finish [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3471.6s)]
*  before they come out of it. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3473.8399999999997s)]
*  So they were high enough. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3474.68s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3475.64s)]
*  I thought they were watching her. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3476.7999999999997s)]
*  I thought it was like an eval or something. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3478.2s)]
*  Maybe they're just fans [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3480.08s)]
*  and they just wanted to talk to you. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3480.9199999999996s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3483.48s)]
*  I think they were just big fans of you. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3485.64s)]
*  Please don't let his presence detract [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3487.64s)]
*  from mine San Diego Zoo employee viewers. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3489.6s)]
*  We're very different individuals. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3493.7999999999997s)]
*  And I don't- [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3495.72s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3497.04s)]
*  She literally condones everything I do [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3497.88s)]
*  and say on a daily basis. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3500.44s)]
*  Nope. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3502.7200000000003s)]
*  Her appearance on my stream [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3503.84s)]
*  is nothing short of an endorsement. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3506.48s)]
*  Nope. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3508.32s)]
*  For everything, any and all things I have said [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3509.1600000000003s)]
*  and will continue to say. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3511.92s)]
*  Included but not limited to animal conservation. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3513.4s)]
*  Pazan, we're on our way to the wombat. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3518.56s)]
*  The wombat. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3523.36s)]
*  The wombat's one of my favorites. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3524.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3525.04s)]
*  They're never out. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3525.88s)]
*  I've seen them one time. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3526.96s)]
*  I think today's the day. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3528.16s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3529.32s)]
*  Today could be the day. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3530.16s)]
*  It would help me a lot today if I saw a wombat. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3532.4s)]
*  I love them, Charlie, they're so cute. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3535.56s)]
*  Ooh, they got an ad break [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3538.12s)]
*  and you didn't give them a top of the hour. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3539.52s)]
*  No, it's the secret one. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3541.32s)]
*  Oh. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3543.4s)]
*  The 30 minute marker. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3544.44s)]
*  Wombat, wombat. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3546.0s)]
*  What kind of an accent does a wombat have? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3547.44s)]
*  Australian. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3549.28s)]
*  Yeah, a lot. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3550.12s)]
*  I was asking, I was just checking if you knew. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3551.36s)]
*  If you knew. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3554.92s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3555.76s)]
*  Kids have no self preservation. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3557.16s)]
*  They are not like sloth babies, you know what I mean? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3560.12s)]
*  Sloth babies aren't either. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3562.64s)]
*  She said they stay with them for like a year. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3563.6s)]
*  I know, but after the six month period, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3565.3199999999997s)]
*  they're like, oh, you're on your own. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3568.0s)]
*  If you did that to a kid, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3569.7599999999998s)]
*  they would just immediately L baby. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3570.6s)]
*  We are going to the outback area [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3572.68s)]
*  so you can do your stupid accent. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3575.68s)]
*  The outback area is nice, I feel it. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3577.0s)]
*  I feel rawed at home, rawed out. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3579.96s)]
*  We are now making a trek down to the outback areas, chat. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3583.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3587.6s)]
*  As you can see, the fawn has changed dramatically. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3588.8799999999997s)]
*  Despite the fact that we're in San Diego, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3592.3599999999997s)]
*  all of a sudden we've got tropic pineapples. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3595.8399999999997s)]
*  Looks like a pineapple. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3601.2s)]
*  Is that a pineapple? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3602.2s)]
*  No. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3603.2s)]
*  No, it's not a pineapple. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=3604.04s)]

*  For those of you who don't know, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4077.72s)]
*  the larger the litter, the better. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4078.56s)]
*  As only, unfortunately, 30% of the cubs survive. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4079.4s)]
*  Dang. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4081.84s)]
*  Predators, like lions, take a toll. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4082.72s)]
*  Cheetahs also sometimes make a sound like birds [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4085.84s)]
*  when they make a chirping noise. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4088.64s)]
*  They also purr, snarl, and growl. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4090.0s)]
*  But they never roar. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4092.4s)]
*  The cheetah runs aren't scheduled though, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4094.84s)]
*  because they only do it when the cheetah wants to do it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4096.08s)]
*  Please do not run. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4097.68s)]
*  So you have to get super lucky. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4098.52s)]
*  So if you run, like you can get the cheetah to get excited [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4099.56s)]
*  and run with you, because they love running? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4101.92s)]
*  No, they like do the demo. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4103.36s)]
*  No, but it says please do not run. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4105.12s)]
*  Yeah, bet. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4106.48s)]
*  Then start chasing it, like our wolf dogs do. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4107.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4109.5599999999995s)]
*  Excited. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4110.5199999999995s)]
*  Dude, that's so sick though. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4111.5599999999995s)]
*  Imagine running with cheetahs. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4112.879999999999s)]
*  I feel like that's something that iShow Speed [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4114.32s)]
*  is gonna inevitably do. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4115.879999999999s)]
*  Dude, humans can run what? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4117.839999999999s)]
*  At what's the fastest, like 30? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4119.959999999999s)]
*  Is it maybe it's in the local? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4123.32s)]
*  22. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4125.04s)]
*  Is it? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4125.879999999999s)]
*  For people, yeah. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4126.719999999999s)]
*  Domestic dogs help wild cheetahs. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4128.5599999999995s)]
*  Conservationists are learning about cheetahs [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4130.839999999999s)]
*  in an unusual way with the help of domestic dogs. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4132.66s)]
*  In the African wilderness, cheetahs are hard to find, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4134.84s)]
*  but these dogs with super sniffers [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4137.0s)]
*  are trained to seek out cheetah scat, poop, in the field. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4139.16s)]
*  Scat samples yield DNA that helps researchers [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4143.0s)]
*  count and identify individual cheetahs [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4144.8s)]
*  and see how they're related and where they go. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4146.24s)]
*  That's sick. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4148.76s)]
*  Domestic dogs that protect livestock [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4149.72s)]
*  are protecting cheetahs too. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4151.0s)]
*  Keeping carnivores at bay means less predation [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4152.16s)]
*  and less retaliation from herders. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4154.26s)]
*  But there's not a single one. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4156.72s)]
*  Cheetah. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4159.24s)]
*  People think that cheetahs are the fastest animal. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4161.64s)]
*  They're actually not, like by a lot if you count birds. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4164.2s)]
*  Paragon falcons can dive at like 240 miles an hour. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4167.64s)]
*  Cheetahs can run like 70. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4170.76s)]
*  God, you are so in the pocket of big bird. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4171.6s)]
*  Like it's kind of unbearable how much you love birds. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4174.2s)]
*  I love birds. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4177.5599999999995s)]
*  You're such, you're big bird. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4178.48s)]
*  Cheer up. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4180.0599999999995s)]
*  Wow, okay, so they're not in there. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4180.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4182.72s)]
*  Yeah, maybe we should have gone the other way. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4183.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4184.5599999999995s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4185.4s)]
*  It's all good. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4186.22s)]
*  We're learning, we're still learning facts about cheetahs. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4187.0599999999995s)]
*  South Africa, cheetah, cheeto. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4189.5599999999995s)]
*  What's in here? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4195.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4196.24s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4197.28s)]
*  Wait, I haven't seen these actually. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4198.12s)]
*  Yeah, are they kookaburra? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4199.76s)]

*  Oh my God. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4203.96s)]
*  Kookaburras start the day with a loud chorus of laughter. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4204.8s)]
*  And they often say good night the same way at dusk. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4208.92s)]
*  Give us a chip, kookaburra. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4213.4s)]
*  Hi buddy. Like that. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4215.84s)]

*  I haven't got a single whiff of that popcorn style piece. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4236.32s)]
*  Careful, we might bite. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4240.48s)]

*  I assume it's keratin, right? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4280.56s)]
*  If they get scared, they can like puff them out, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4282.76s)]

*  I'm just testing your knowledge. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4294.2s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4296.36s)]
*  It's like hyper matted. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4297.64s)]
*  It's not even matted at that point. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4299.76s)]
*  It like feels like a bone basically. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4301.2s)]

*  I like that they're just walking in circles. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4313.76s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4315.5199999999995s)]
*  What the dog doing? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4317.04s)]
*  I think that one just wants to leave. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4318.64s)]
*  Maybe they feed him from that hole or something, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4321.0s)]
*  or when they bring the food in from that side. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4323.12s)]

*  It's feeding time. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4356.48s)]
*  More flamingos. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4358.2s)]
*  Oh, Don Quixote, do flamingo. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4359.32s)]
*  Damn, there's a white one. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4362.16s)]
*  That's what they sound like. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4364.44s)]
*  Is the white one also a flamingo? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4365.48s)]
*  Not a white one. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4367.24s)]
*  Oh, in the back? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4368.12s)]
*  Yeah, what is that? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4368.96s)]
*  When they're born gray, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4369.8s)]
*  they get their color from what they eat. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4371.08s)]
*  So that means it's like a little baby? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4372.76s)]
*  So he's younger probably. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4374.12s)]
*  If it's white, it means it's like a baby? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4375.24s)]
*  Or no, it's a greater one maybe? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4377.08s)]
*  Threats to flamingos are habitat loss, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4378.84s)]
*  predators such as big cats, vultures, and foxes, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4381.36s)]
*  poaching for feathers and eggs, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4384.12s)]
*  and people distributing their colonies, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4386.36s)]
*  which causes eggs and chicks to be abandoned. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4387.64s)]
*  Nice, I saw a nice. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4390.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of an L. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4391.44s)]
*  Some of them are called lesser flamingos [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4393.04s)]
*  and greater flamingos, that's weird. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4394.76s)]
*  Yeah, you suck. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4397.6s)]
*  You're a lesser flamingo. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4398.84s)]
*  These missers are nice. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4400.08s)]
*  That one looks crazy. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4401.280000000001s)]
*  Look at the white one. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4402.68s)]
*  Hi, handsome. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4403.52s)]

*  What's up, big dog? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4407.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, he knows. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4409.6s)]
*  Yo, we're just. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4413.56s)]

*  I know their language, I'm speaking it. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4420.68s)]
*  Say something again. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4422.4800000000005s)]

*  Zebras drink water every day, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4464.54s)]
*  and zebra habitat depends on water availability. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4465.74s)]
*  Family, as you might have guessed, zebra's asses. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4467.62s)]
*  I said a bad word. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4469.66s)]
*  And horses are closely related. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4470.98s)]
*  In fact, they share the same genus. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4472.82s)]

*  or white with black stripes? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4524.0199999999995s)]

*  I don't know if there's a real answer. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4527.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that their skin is black [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4528.94s)]
*  if that makes any difference. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4530.179999999999s)]
*  So is that the skin or the fur that's black right there? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4532.74s)]
*  Well, both. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4535.5s)]

*  They're so pretty. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4538.900000000001s)]

*  I thought about it. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4554.02s)]
*  You wanna ride it? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4554.860000000001s)]

*  This one doesn't look so mean. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4557.5s)]
*  I always tell people as a horse girl myself, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4558.74s)]
*  I always tell people that like, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4562.34s)]
*  horses are basically like dogs, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4564.62s)]
*  but smarter and much larger. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4566.58s)]
*  But I do feel like they're very similar to dogs. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4569.62s)]
*  Grants. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4572.94s)]
*  A lot of people are terrified of horses. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4573.86s)]
*  Well, I mean, horses are dangerous. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4576.1s)]
*  They are, but only due to their size. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4577.94s)]
*  I mean, they're not like, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4582.14s)]
*  I guess it depends if there's like a mare in heat [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4584.0599999999995s)]
*  or something and you're around a stallion, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4587.46s)]
*  then they might get a little, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4589.42s)]
*  oh my God, speaking of horses, look at these horses. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=4592.0199999999995s)]

*  I'll clear it. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5968.74s)]
*  And then there's also a raven [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5969.58s)]
*  who has a little snack in his mouth. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5970.46s)]

*  Crows versus ravens chat. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5977.1s)]
*  Ravens are much bigger, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5978.38s)]

*  and then they have, oh, beak. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5988.46s)]
*  And then sometimes they have those [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5990.7s)]
*  kinda like beard feathers underneath. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5991.9800000000005s)]

*  And then ravens' tails are in a V shape, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5995.34s)]
*  and crows have a straight across. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=5997.9800000000005s)]

*  they find suitors for tigers 3,000 miles away, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6004.7s)]
*  and then they match them up. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6008.860000000001s)]
*  They got riot chat, they're on riot. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6011.32s)]

*  I like to do that. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6024.98s)]
*  Sometimes I leave it in my beard. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6025.82s)]
*  It's called cashing. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6027.0599999999995s)]
*  That's gross. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6028.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, it's cool when the raven does it, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6028.9s)]
*  but when I do it, it's gross? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6030.139999999999s)]
*  Double standards much? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6031.78s)]

*  Rabbit, maybe? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6050.34s)]
*  So they eat, so is it the massive one [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6051.82s)]
*  that eats the rabbit or is it the raven? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6055.66s)]
*  They both do. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6056.5s)]
*  Ravens eat, they're scavengers. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6057.32s)]
*  So they like carry on and stuff. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6058.5s)]
*  Is that a real skull or is that fake? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6059.94s)]

*  Were they like being hunted for meat or something? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6094.700000000001s)]
*  Leigh was a big driver. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6096.900000000001s)]
*  Wait, ooh, I'm so sorry. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6098.580000000001s)]
*  So DDT pesticide that took out their, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6100.02s)]
*  I will show you guys this too real quick. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6102.860000000001s)]
*  So when they were releasing them, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6105.120000000001s)]
*  they were just electrocuting on the power lines [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6107.360000000001s)]
*  and they were like, wow, we put all this effort in, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6110.14s)]
*  and they're just dying right when they go out. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6111.98s)]
*  So what they did is built them a fake electric line. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6113.9s)]
*  So every time they would sit on it, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6116.66s)]
*  it would give a really loud noise to then train them [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6118.219999999999s)]
*  when they go out in the wild to stay away from power lines. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6121.98s)]
*  So then they start doing it. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6124.379999999999s)]
*  So the reason they went super, super endangered, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6126.099999999999s)]
*  DDT is a pesticide, made the eggshells really thin. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6129.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they just, babies would die [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6131.62s)]
*  before they had a chance. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6132.82s)]
*  So they would like lay eggs and they'd be like squishy. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6134.219999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6136.9s)]
*  So that's what bald eagles and peregrines do. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6137.74s)]
*  Damn. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6139.139999999999s)]
*  They'd lay eggs and the eggs would be really squishy [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6139.98s)]
*  and they laid them chat instead of strong. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6141.9s)]
*  So they would sit on them and the eggs would just pop. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6143.42s)]
*  What about wind turbines? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6145.219999999999s)]
*  Is Trump right? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6146.0599999999995s)]
*  Are wind turbines the bald eagles or what? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6147.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6148.54s)]
*  Wait, he is right. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6149.379999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6150.219999999999s)]
*  They're not. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6151.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, oh, look at the llama. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6151.9s)]
*  If you paint one wind turbine black, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6153.66s)]
*  one of the blades, it reduces strikes by like 60%. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6156.0599999999995s)]
*  He said if you paint one of the wind turbine blades black, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6159.0199999999995s)]
*  it reduces strikes by like 60%. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6161.9s)]
*  I haven't heard that stat before. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6163.86s)]
*  This is a llama. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6165.9s)]
*  Is that an L for bald eagles? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6168.139999999999s)]
*  I thought they were smart. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6169.42s)]
*  Bald eagles are not very smart. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6171.0199999999995s)]
*  It's just that all migratory birds [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6172.3s)]
*  just get struck by them. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6173.78s)]
*  That's not right. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6174.74s)]
*  Cause you put them in the wind pass [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6175.58s)]
*  where birds are migrating. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6177.22s)]
*  That's not fair. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6179.099999999999s)]
*  I want to say bald eagles aren't smart, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6180.139999999999s)]
*  but I don't think there is like stoic [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6182.139999999999s)]
*  and magnificent as everybody thinks. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6184.18s)]
*  They also don't sound like the eagle scream [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6187.9s)]
*  that everyone associates them with. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6190.66s)]
*  You eat the paper. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6192.86s)]
*  No, let's put them up. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6194.62s)]
*  No, the sound associated with the bald eagle [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6196.46s)]
*  is actually a red tail hawk. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6198.22s)]
*  Oh my gosh, it's on. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6201.22s)]
*  And that the bald eagle actually sounds kind of lame. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6202.14s)]
*  But Americans were like, we have to, he looks cool. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6205.82s)]
*  And we kind of ran with him. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6209.26s)]
*  So we just have to fake it like he sounds like that. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6211.14s)]
*  More animal facts with Hasanabi. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6213.86s)]
*  Yeah, he's a conservationist. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6216.26s)]
*  More bit of a conservationist. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6218.42s)]
*  Camel. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6220.26s)]
*  Camel? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6221.86s)]
*  Camel. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6223.34s)]
*  Their camels are so sick and rideable. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6224.74s)]
*  Yeah, people ride camels. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6227.9400000000005s)]
*  Big bonus, I think. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6229.06s)]
*  I guess donkeys are rideable too. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6230.42s)]
*  Donkeys are rideable. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6232.46s)]
*  Camels have really big teeth [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6234.26s)]
*  towards the back of their mouth [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6237.1s)]
*  and they can rip your scalp off. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6238.46s)]
*  Look at that thing, man. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6241.14s)]
*  He going wild on that. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6243.1s)]
*  It's like catnip. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6244.900000000001s)]
*  He likes it. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6248.3s)]
*  In Turkey or in Muslim countries, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6249.22s)]
*  a camel is like the highest, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6250.780000000001s)]
*  I think it's like one of the highest tiers of sacrifice. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6254.26s)]
*  What? [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6257.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like in Kurban Bayramı, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6258.94s)]
*  in Turkey you sacrifice like a sheep. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6261.42s)]
*  Do you like eat it at least? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6265.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6266.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and every part of the animal [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6267.5s)]
*  is supposed to be preserved, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6269.1s)]
*  you're supposed to give it to the entire neighborhood [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6270.0199999999995s)]
*  or to people with less, people that have less than you [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6271.74s)]
*  and the camel, or sometimes they sacrifice [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6274.1s)]
*  as a way to like, as a means to protect like, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6276.7s)]
*  in Turkey, I remember like Turkish Airlines, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6280.22s)]
*  they literally, like when they buy a new fleet, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6282.7s)]
*  they'll like sacrifice it. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6285.42s)]
*  Sometimes they'll sacrifice a camel. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6287.3s)]
*  It's the highest tier. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6289.900000000001s)]
*  I have not. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6293.58s)]
*  I assume it tastes like, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6295.02s)]
*  oh, there it is. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6296.14s)]

*  You think? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6334.66s)]
*  It's like the African version, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6335.5s)]
*  or if you go back far enough in time, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6338.0599999999995s)]
*  the Californian version. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6340.42s)]

*  Are they still related because they're extinct? [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6363.22s)]
*  Are they related? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6365.5s)]
*  Technically, the mammoths are extinct, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6366.700000000001s)]
*  so elephants would have to be a different thing, right? [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6368.780000000001s)]
*  They're not like evolved out of mammoths. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6371.02s)]
*  They have a common... [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6372.740000000001s)]
*  Elephant relatives. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6373.620000000001s)]
*  Manatees, dugongs, and hyraxes [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6374.900000000001s)]
*  are the elephant's closest living relatives. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6376.860000000001s)]
*  It doesn't say anything about mammoths on this thing. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6379.5s)]
*  I think they share a common ancestor. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6381.540000000001s)]
*  Common ancestor? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6383.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6384.740000000001s)]
*  There's some reason I remember reading something [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6385.580000000001s)]
*  that is like... [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6387.26s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6389.26s)]
*  The reason why I'm asking is... [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6390.1s)]
*  I remember reading something about them [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6390.9400000000005s)]
*  actually being super different, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6391.780000000001s)]
*  even though they look the same. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6393.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's like one of those things. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6394.580000000001s)]
*  You know how like hyenas are technically closer [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6395.740000000001s)]
*  related, I think, to cats than dogs, right? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6398.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6400.54s)]
*  It's like that. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6401.9s)]
*  It's one of those like nature debates. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6402.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6404.5s)]
*  Evolution, apparently. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6405.5s)]
*  Extinct pygmy mammoth. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6407.22s)]
*  Mini mammoth only existing in California. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6408.9s)]
*  Descendants of Kansai... [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6411.62s)]
*  Similar living animal, Asian elephant and African elephant. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6412.9s)]
*  I feel like if they were... [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6416.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6417.54s)]
*  I'd have to read it. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6418.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6419.58s)]
*  Convergent evolution, Hasan and Maya. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6420.42s)]
*  So they're all the same niche, but they're different. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6422.42s)]
*  Well, not the same niche necessarily. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6424.66s)]
*  Just that they have similar physiological features, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6427.18s)]
*  but they're not related. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6430.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6431.580000000001s)]
*  They just happen to kind of look like that. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6432.42s)]
*  I guess. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6434.42s)]
*  Okay, I'm not gonna lie, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6435.26s)]
*  the elephant was a little underwhelming. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6436.080000000001s)]
*  I didn't see a lot of them. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6437.02s)]
*  They have more. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6437.860000000001s)]
*  No, okay. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6438.700000000001s)]
*  I didn't see enough movement from this one guy. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6439.540000000001s)]
*  He's chilling. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6441.38s)]
*  He's big chilling. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6442.22s)]
*  All right, how much did this whole area cost? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6443.06s)]
*  Do you remember? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6445.580000000001s)]
*  Hasan, guess how much the whole elephant odyssey cost? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6446.42s)]
*  Yo, Maya, we gotta do this. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6448.02s)]
*  Oh my God, do we? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6450.18s)]
*  How do I even? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6452.42s)]
*  You want me to be in here? [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6453.26s)]
*  We did it. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6454.580000000001s)]
*  How much does this area cost? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6455.42s)]
*  Guess. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6458.34s)]
*  Elephant odyssey. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6459.3s)]
*  So not just the elephants, but this whole part, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6460.14s)]
*  this whole exhibit. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6463.22s)]
*  I'm gonna say $30 million. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6465.42s)]
*  This is not looking good. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6467.46s)]
*  You know what? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6469.02s)]
*  That's a damn good guess. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6469.860000000001s)]
*  How much was it? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6471.46s)]
*  45. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6472.46s)]
*  Damn. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6473.74s)]
*  Close. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6474.7s)]
*  $45 million. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6475.54s)]
*  I mean, it's like, that's not, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6476.7s)]
*  I mean, it makes sense. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6478.18s)]
*  I feel like that's not so expensive for an elephant enclosure. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6479.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, it gets pretty crazy over here. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6485.5s)]
*  Does that require upkeep? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6487.14s)]
*  Okay, that's Jurassic Park. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6489.780000000001s)]
*  That's just Jurassic Park. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6490.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6494.1s)]
*  Do elephants like peanuts or is that like a cartoon thing? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6494.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't, I bet they would. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6498.660000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6500.3s)]
*  Remember, Chad, if you ever want to feed crows, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6501.14s)]
*  you have to give them unsalted peanuts [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6503.3s)]

*  They don't like that. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6513.46s)]
*  They will eat it, but it's not good for them, right? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6515.1s)]
*  I think. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6517.9800000000005s)]
*  I think the crow guy in my chat will be very happy [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6519.66s)]

*  So Chad, this is part of why it costs so much money. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6525.54s)]

*  I don't know if you have to give an elephant eye drops [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6539.0599999999995s)]
*  or something, you got to be up on a platform. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6540.98s)]

*  But in a... [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6697.78s)]
*  Yummy, eat it. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6698.62s)]
*  In a, you know, obviously habitat saving kind of way, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6699.74s)]
*  and not in a way that is like incredibly disruptive [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6703.94s)]
*  where they beat the shit out of them [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6706.78s)]

*  Yeah, elephants never forget. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6716.7s)]

*  They are, they were overcome with tragedy on that day [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6720.94s)]
*  and still think about it all the time. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6724.5s)]

*  Asian elephants are smaller and have smaller ears. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6737.419999999999s)]
*  These are African elephants. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6739.98s)]
*  Wasn't there like an elephant that went back to a village [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6741.0199999999995s)]
*  and like everybody there or something? [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6743.219999999999s)]

*  I suspect not on purpose, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6749.34s)]
*  but also probably on purpose too if you piss them off. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6750.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the interesting thing about animal attacks is like, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6754.14s)]

*  He looks like he's, ha ha ha. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6762.54s)]
*  It's always like a defensive behavior, you know, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6764.82s)]
*  or like a territorial behavior, [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6766.7s)]
*  or like people moved into where he lived [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6768.06s)]
*  and he was like, get out. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6770.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6772.3s)]
*  Do elephants also like wag their tails like dogs [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6773.14s)]
*  when they're happy or no? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6775.26s)]
*  I would assume any tail wagging over there is like flies. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6776.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6780.42s)]

*  That's sick. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6794.94s)]
*  So they're starting to study elephants' testicles [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6795.78s)]
*  because they're up inside of them [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6797.66s)]

*  and they recognize nine different cancer-saving [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6801.34s)]
*  like chemicals in there that they're trying to use [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6805.0199999999995s)]
*  for humans for cancer research [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6807.459999999999s)]

*  I don't know what- [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6930.5s)]

*  Or cause he's a pirate, like what's going on? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6932.46s)]

*  I don't know what ticked him off, but yeah. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6946.42s)]

*  and be chill with this in this heat. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6950.22s)]

*  It's like super wiry. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6960.740000000001s)]
*  Gross. Pigs are very cute, but also very gross. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6962.14s)]
*  When you come in proximity to one, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6967.1s)]
*  you're like, that's like a disgusting human. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6969.22s)]
*  That's mean. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6971.62s)]
*  It literally, but it like, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6972.46s)]
*  it feels like you're touching the belly [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6975.1s)]
*  of a very hairy person who hasn't showered in years. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6977.5s)]
*  Okay, that's fair. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6981.62s)]
*  Wait, okay, Chet, we're making like good progress here then. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6982.98s)]
*  We're already at the Capybaras, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6986.42s)]
*  which means if somebody remembers the map [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6987.62s)]
*  that I looked at, I do not. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6990.1s)]
*  What happened, did you throw it? [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6991.54s)]
*  Or did you put it in your little bag? [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6992.38s)]
*  We're gonna come up on polar bears, on lions, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6993.7s)]
*  and then hippos, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6995.7s)]
*  but we're moving through it faster than I thought. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=6997.18s)]

*  They're just hanging out, man. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7006.42s)]
*  I wanna see one walk, but. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7009.06s)]
*  What a life. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7010.86s)]
*  What an enclosure. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7012.06s)]
*  They're so pretty, like their eye slit is so, [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7012.9s)]
*  I don't know, they just look very. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7016.9400000000005s)]
*  They were very, they're giving like clean girl to me. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7018.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7021.38s)]
*  That aesthetic. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7022.22s)]
*  Look at their little, they're like little platypus, [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7023.06s)]
*  duck bill, or not duck bill, but like the little duck feet. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7025.42s)]
*  Yeah, they're really good at swimming. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7028.9s)]
*  That's why they're excellent swimmers, Chet. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7029.74s)]
*  I mean, if I was a cap bar, [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7031.5s)]
*  I'd be chilling by the waterfall too. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7032.5s)]
*  I'd be like, this is sick. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7034.18s)]
*  I love that they're sitting at the edge, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7035.62s)]
*  like just taking in the water. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7038.0199999999995s)]
*  I didn't even notice that one, he's huge. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7040.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7042.3s)]

*  What's your favorite animal? [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7044.98s)]
*  I really like hippos and capybaras. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7045.94s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7048.0599999999995s)]
*  Which is ironic, because they're both on the opposite ends [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7048.9s)]
*  of the spectrum of like being violent. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7052.26s)]
*  And I think what's interesting is capybaras do exist around, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7055.74s)]
*  coexist around hippos, if I'm not mistaken. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7059.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7060.86s)]
*  And like literally hippos don't do anything to them. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7061.68s)]
*  Like hippos are chill with capybaras. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7063.9s)]
*  That's how chill they are. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7065.86s)]
*  Look, he's eating, yum. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7067.46s)]
*  Come on, he's fed. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7068.98s)]
*  That's a great brush we need for winning. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7071.179999999999s)]
*  You did one that big. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7073.82s)]
*  They have so many cool toys. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7076.74s)]
*  Do they? Yeah, they do. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7079.179999999999s)]

*  Oh yeah. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7081.86s)]
*  With the trunk, yeah. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7082.7s)]
*  What do you think they play on the speakers? [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7084.54s)]
*  Like elephant noises to tell them it's time to go home? [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7087.54s)]
*  Are there speakers? [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7089.379999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, you're right. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7090.219999999999s)]

*  What's he doing? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7094.06s)]
*  He's gonna go itch. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7094.98s)]
*  That's good, it's fine. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7098.02s)]

*  We go way back. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7116.62s)]
*  They understand. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7117.9s)]
*  Not a big deal. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7119.64s)]
*  I think there's a lion right there. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7120.54s)]
*  Oh. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7122.74s)]

*  Oh my gosh. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7134.98s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7136.5s)]
*  I don't like that. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7138.42s)]
*  It's right here, Hasan. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7139.66s)]
*  I'm gonna throw this out, I'll be back. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7140.5s)]
*  Chad, this is not, this is the inside, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7141.82s)]
*  probably air conditioned portion [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7145.3s)]
*  of this jaguar's enclosure. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7147.0199999999995s)]
*  This is not where he lives. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7148.219999999999s)]
*  That, wow. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7149.5s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7152.0199999999995s)]
*  That's so sick. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7153.179999999999s)]
*  If we were in the, if I was in there, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7155.82s)]
*  he'd beat me, right? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7157.259999999999s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7158.74s)]
*  Or are they, I mean, they're cats. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7159.9s)]
*  They're like, unreliable. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7161.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7163.139999999999s)]
*  Like how did the zookeepers like take care of him? [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7164.459999999999s)]
*  They'll like switch him and like close the store, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7167.66s)]
*  for example, right, to go out into this enclosure. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7170.5s)]
*  Oh, so instead of, like they are never in there. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7172.74s)]
*  Never in there with him, no way. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7174.78s)]
*  All protected contact. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7176.94s)]
*  Guys, the difference between a jaguar and a leopard, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7178.299999999999s)]
*  so his spots, you should show him. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7180.54s)]
*  So his spots, jaguars have like the rings [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7183.1s)]
*  and then they have dots inside the rings. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7186.26s)]
*  Leopards just have rings with nothing in them. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7188.14s)]
*  And then jaguars, this is like Amazon rainforest, right? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7190.82s)]
*  And leopards are African big cats. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7194.74s)]
*  Jaguars. He looks annoyed. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7197.54s)]
*  He's sleepy. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7198.86s)]
*  Jaguars, super strong, super stout, like shorter. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7200.42s)]
*  And leopards are, they don't look as buff, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7204.42s)]
*  like they're, they're not lanky by any means. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7208.94s)]
*  Whoa, jaguars are proud. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7212.259999999999s)]
*  12,000 years ago, they were about 20% larger [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7213.099999999999s)]
*  than today's cats. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7214.7s)]
*  They also had longer legs. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7216.179999999999s)]
*  Jaguars are proud 12,000 years ago [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7217.179999999999s)]
*  in the Pleistocene period. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7220.379999999999s)]
*  They also had longer legs, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7224.179999999999s)]
*  probably because they stalk prey animals [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7225.179999999999s)]
*  and open plains instead of pouncing on them from trees. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7226.62s)]
*  And they lived in North America. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7230.0199999999995s)]
*  My understanding, a little sad, [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7231.9s)]
*  can you just spell that out about cats and captivity? [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7233.54s)]
*  Like they sleep 18 hours a day. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7237.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so cats, just like domestic cats [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7238.62s)]
*  and big cats in captivity, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7241.339999999999s)]
*  sleep an incredible amount of hours a day, [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7242.46s)]
*  like up to 18 hours a day. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7244.86s)]
*  So he's just sleeping, chilling. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7246.82s)]
*  Like this is what your house cat would do [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7248.82s)]
*  in a windowsill kind of thing. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7250.54s)]
*  But this is not his enclosure. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7252.74s)]
*  This is not where he lives. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7253.82s)]
*  This is probably maybe like an air conditioned part [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7254.86s)]
*  of a much larger enclosure. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7257.219999999999s)]
*  He's got a big outside space if he wanted to be outside. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7259.0599999999995s)]
*  But he's cozy. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7261.66s)]
*  He's rested. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7262.58s)]
*  Probably should not be taking flash photography. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7267.34s)]
*  No, probably not. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7269.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's annoying. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7270.38s)]
*  Oh, they opened this up. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7271.82s)]
*  This is under construction the other day. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7272.66s)]
*  Oh! [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7274.3s)]
*  Long live the king. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7276.0599999999995s)]
*  Caution, spray rain seven to 10 feet. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7277.9s)]
*  Oh. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7280.14s)]
*  That'd be so sick. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7280.98s)]
*  That would be awesome. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7281.8s)]
*  You probably would smell for the rest of the week, but. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7282.64s)]
*  Can we take a picture? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7285.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7286.98s)]
*  Do you feel like, that's like, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7287.82s)]
*  you need like a specific chemical to get that off, [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7288.64s)]
*  I assume, right? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7290.5s)]
*  I want you in there. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7291.900000000001s)]
*  You want me in it? Okay. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7292.74s)]
*  Sorry, sorry, sorry. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7293.9400000000005s)]
*  I wonder if they can get inside. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7295.78s)]
*  No problem. Have a good one, guys. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7297.26s)]
*  This way, you guys. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7298.1s)]
*  Can we walk on the other side? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7298.9400000000005s)]
*  Let's see what's inside. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7300.34s)]
*  Is it here? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7303.1s)]
*  I can't see it. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7303.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh no, there's a lion. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7304.78s)]
*  It's huge. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7305.9800000000005s)]
*  On this rock. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7306.82s)]
*  The ice cream sandwich looks bomb. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7308.66s)]
*  Dude, I saw you looking at it. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7309.9800000000005s)]
*  It's so funny. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7311.06s)]
*  I was like, he wants an ice cream. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7311.900000000001s)]
*  Oh! [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7314.02s)]

*  There's a stick right about it. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7319.3s)]
*  Yeah, a little tiny lizard. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7320.62s)]
*  Oh, cute. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7322.26s)]
*  Isn't this all, this is all they do. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7325.34s)]
*  18 hours, 20 hours out of the day? [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7327.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7329.26s)]
*  It's a nice life. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7330.5s)]
*  They're big, typical men. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7331.38s)]
*  It's the most, it's the most misogynist animal, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7332.62s)]
*  I would say. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7335.3s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7336.78s)]
*  The women do everything. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7338.14s)]
*  They don't do anything. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7339.5s)]
*  They sleep for 18 hours. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7340.58s)]
*  And once a year, they, like I said, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7342.14s)]
*  for like a couple days straight, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7344.26s)]
*  and then they just go back to chilling. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7346.0199999999995s)]
*  And all they have to do is like look big, right? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7347.7s)]
*  They have to have like a big mane and look big. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7349.5s)]
*  And then that's like automatically, [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7351.18s)]
*  you're like defending the pride. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7352.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7354.62s)]
*  Male lions have sex with each other a lot. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7355.74s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7358.34s)]
*  They're also, yeah, there you go. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7359.18s)]
*  They're so misogynistic. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7360.62s)]
*  They don't even want to go with the women. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7361.7s)]
*  Why do you know so much about how gay animals are? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7364.34s)]
*  I'm noticing a pattern. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7366.66s)]
*  I'm noticing a specific type of knowledge [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7368.1s)]
*  that you have accumulated. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7370.1s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I've done some like animal sex dreams, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7371.62s)]
*  like for Valentine's Day and stuff. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7374.82s)]
*  You did an episode. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7376.58s)]
*  Yeah, we did a world's gayest episode of World's Wildest. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7377.62s)]

*  That's nice. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7666.86s)]
*  Such a pretty looking animal. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7668.139999999999s)]
*  Hassan, what do you think so far? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7669.62s)]
*  I love it. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7671.38s)]
*  I love the zoo. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7672.219999999999s)]
*  Yay for the zoo. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7673.0599999999995s)]
*  It's incredible. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7673.9s)]
*  The Bontebeek. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7675.219999999999s)]
*  You see it? [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7677.98s)]
*  I don't, but apparently, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7678.82s)]
*  although they're not considered endangered [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7680.54s)]
*  because there's a lot that live in private lands, [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7682.219999999999s)]
*  they do not make it out in the wild. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7684.219999999999s)]
*  They get clapped. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7685.9s)]
*  They live on private ranches and reserves. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7687.0599999999995s)]
*  They rest through the hottest time of the day. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7689.0199999999995s)]
*  Why are you laughing? [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7690.82s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7691.74s)]
*  I think it's really nice [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7692.58s)]
*  that you're teaching them everything. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7693.58s)]
*  I want to learn myself. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7695.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7696.9s)]
*  Oh, look at it. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7697.74s)]
*  Oh, it's back there. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7698.58s)]
*  Chad won't be able to see that. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7699.5s)]
*  Oh, maybe they will. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7700.74s)]
*  Oh, he's on the move. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7701.74s)]
*  It's like a fancy goat. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7702.7s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta get one of these. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7704.139999999999s)]
*  You think? [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7705.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7706.7s)]
*  Show the goats what's what. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7707.9s)]
*  I don't think this one is violent like your goats though. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7709.139999999999s)]
*  I hope not, because that would suck. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7712.74s)]
*  That would be much more damaging to your cars. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7714.34s)]
*  I feel like he could pack a punch. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7716.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7719.099999999999s)]
*  Significantly worse. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7719.94s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7720.82s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7723.86s)]
*  It's the quiet area. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7725.34s)]
*  The quiet area. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7727.0599999999995s)]
*  What is that? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7728.78s)]
*  What is that for? [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7729.62s)]
*  What's over there? [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7730.46s)]
*  Let's go over there. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7731.3s)]
*  Let's go to the quiet area. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7732.139999999999s)]
*  You better be quiet. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7732.98s)]
*  Where? What are we looking at? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7733.82s)]
*  There's like some antelope deer like things back there. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7734.82s)]
*  They ain't coming out here. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7739.139999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7740.5s)]
*  I wonder why you have to be quiet right here. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7742.46s)]
*  Maybe it's for people. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7744.9s)]
*  Do not feed. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7746.54s)]
*  That would be so lame. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7747.42s)]
*  I can't believe they have to say that. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7748.58s)]
*  Polar bears. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7750.0199999999995s)]
*  What? Yeah. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7751.94s)]
*  They got the lesser kudu in this spekis gazelle. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7752.78s)]
*  Further threats include drought competition [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7756.0599999999995s)]
*  from domestic livestock and illegal wildlife trade. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7757.7s)]
*  Lesser kudu's preference for dense cover [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7761.9s)]
*  has allowed the species to withstand hunting pressure. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7763.62s)]
*  The lesser kudu's sound looks great. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7766.299999999999s)]
*  That looks like a f**ked up deer. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7768.339999999999s)]
*  Looks like a f**ked up deer goat. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7770.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7771.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7772.58s)]
*  You see that in North America, you're like, [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7773.419999999999s)]
*  oh, I'm being visited by the spirit of the forest. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7775.219999999999s)]
*  It reminds me of like an animated film. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7777.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7780.66s)]
*  But these ones don't have horns, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7781.62s)]
*  so they're kind of L, except for that one. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7782.94s)]
*  Polar bear? [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7785.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7785.86s)]
*  What the polar bear doing in Arlington? [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7788.82s)]
*  Polar bear. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7791.179999999999s)]
*  Polar bear. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7792.58s)]
*  Beep beep beep beep polar bear. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7794.58s)]
*  Polar bears are one of the only carnivorous bear. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7797.0599999999995s)]
*  They actually do give their polar bears here [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7802.22s)]
*  like cantaloupe and some other produce. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7804.099999999999s)]
*  But in the wild, they're the only carnivorous bear, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7808.62s)]
*  which makes them really dangerous for people, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7812.62s)]
*  but we don't come across polar bears very often. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7814.98s)]
*  People chill and feed them a diet of mostly meat. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7817.5s)]
*  They love carrot and yam trees. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7820.34s)]
*  They get fewer calories from them. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7821.58s)]
*  You guys have to see this. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7824.26s)]
*  Is there a way to see them? [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7825.46s)]
*  Probably up there. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7826.46s)]
*  But there's a- [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7828.14s)]
*  Man, that water is dirty. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7828.98s)]
*  There's like a statue that you can stand next to [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7830.26s)]
*  of how tall they can be. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7834.42s)]
*  Wait, they also love playing with objects. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7836.46s)]
*  That is insane. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7838.62s)]
*  Dude, what the heck? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7841.78s)]
*  They're massive bears. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7843.82s)]
*  So much bigger than brown bears, black bears. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7845.62s)]
*  I think people understand how big they can be. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7847.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7850.74s)]
*  I'd be like, little bro, watch out. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7852.06s)]
*  And then this one comes in and you're like, huh. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7853.26s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7855.1s)]
*  Insane. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7856.78s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7857.86s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7858.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't want to. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7860.5s)]
*  This would, I mean, no wonder they're so vicious, dude. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7861.46s)]
*  They're so violent. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7864.54s)]
*  Good bear. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7866.46s)]
*  Good bear. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7867.78s)]
*  Please don't. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7868.66s)]
*  Insane. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7871.66s)]
*  Insane, insane, insane, insane, insane, insane. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7872.5s)]
*  So we get to see them? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7874.58s)]
*  You think? [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7876.18s)]
*  I hope so. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7877.0199999999995s)]
*  They're sick freaks, right? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7880.46s)]
*  What? [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7882.7s)]
*  They're freaks, aren't they? [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7883.54s)]
*  In what regard? [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7884.66s)]
*  Oh, you can go in the den? [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7885.62s)]
*  You want to go in? [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7887.42s)]
*  Not really. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7888.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7890.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, they're all in my app. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7891.34s)]
*  What is that? [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7892.86s)]
*  An ice machine. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7894.7s)]
*  It's just an ice machine. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7896.46s)]
*  Damn. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7901.3s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to lie. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7902.14s)]
*  I would be chilling in the AC as well [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7903.58s)]
*  if I was a polar bear or as a human really. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7905.54s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be out here. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7910.06s)]
*  It's so hot. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7910.98s)]
*  They probably come out more at night, I assume. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7912.82s)]
*  Oh, weird. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7915.62s)]
*  Oh, oh, God damn, that's big. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7919.1s)]
*  Oh my God, that's a big boy. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7921.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7925.46s)]
*  So are they more chill with humans? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7928.46s)]
*  Can humans be in the same enclosure [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7930.86s)]
*  when they're not locked away? [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7932.62s)]
*  Because these ones are like... [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7934.66s)]
*  No, no, there's no way they do any free contact here. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7935.5s)]
*  Same thing with the jaguar. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7938.74s)]
*  They're just going to move them to go in. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7939.9s)]
*  How do they get in the move? [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7942.62s)]
*  They just put food there, they lock the cages, [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7943.58s)]
*  put the food there, and then they open the cages. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7945.58s)]
*  They leave, they open the cages, they go in the cages, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7947.94s)]
*  they lock the cages again, and then they clean the area? [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7949.9s)]
*  Yeah, yep. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7953.18s)]
*  Makes sense. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7955.1s)]
*  I caught a pea, I caught one. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7955.9400000000005s)]
*  One frame, I'm happy with it. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7958.66s)]
*  I don't know if you guys got to see it, but now... [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7961.900000000001s)]
*  A little tiny bear. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7964.3s)]
*  Sorry guys, he's in the AC today. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7965.7s)]
*  There's three, I think, there's not one. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7969.860000000001s)]
*  Really? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7971.38s)]
*  Yeah, I saw their names downstairs. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7972.22s)]
*  Cool. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7974.1s)]
*  Like... [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7974.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, I saw its long ass neck. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7976.66s)]
*  Like even from the hallway, [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7979.42s)]
*  it was like three whole seconds of his neck moving, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7982.38s)]
*  which is weird when you think about it. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7985.58s)]
*  It's like unexpectedly tall and lanky. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7987.74s)]
*  I thought bears are more like compact, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7990.58s)]
*  but I guess polar bears are lanky and tall. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7992.58s)]
*  If you ever go to Alaska, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7995.82s)]
*  we can get you to a place where you can meet bears. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=7996.82s)]
*  Not polar bears, I assume? [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8000.58s)]
*  Black and brown bears. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8001.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8003.38s)]
*  What was it? [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8004.34s)]
*  Is the brown bears that are scary, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8005.18s)]
*  black bears are chill, right? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8006.7s)]
*  Black bears, if they're attacking you, [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8008.86s)]
*  they want you for food, and they're not gonna say no. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8010.98s)]
*  Brown bears, if they're attacking you, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8013.099999999999s)]
*  it's because they're territorial. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8014.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8016.0599999999995s)]
*  And if you just lay down, you'll live. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8016.9s)]
*  But which one is more aggressive? [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8017.94s)]
*  Brown. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8019.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8020.62s)]
*  But if it's a black bear that's attacking you, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8021.46s)]
*  it's less likely, but if it happens, [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8023.0199999999995s)]
*  that means they wanna eat you, is what you're saying. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8024.38s)]
*  So you're done, you're not gonna be able to get away. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8026.46s)]
*  If you fight a black bear, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8028.299999999999s)]
*  just go into fetal pose for brown bear. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8029.62s)]
*  Oh, you go into fetal pose? [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8032.58s)]
*  Yep. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8034.5s)]
*  I thought you were supposed to be like big, like, ah! [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8035.34s)]
*  If they're on top of you. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8037.42s)]
*  If they're on top of you, go in fetal pose. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8038.78s)]
*  Oh. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8040.3s)]
*  But it's scary more, I would. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8041.14s)]
*  Canadian lynx. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8041.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they're not. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8042.820000000001s)]
*  They're also beautiful. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8044.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8045.54s)]
*  Beautiful. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8046.38s)]
*  Canadian lynx eat mice, squirrels, and birds, [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8047.22s)]
*  but prefer the snowshoe hare [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8048.9400000000005s)]
*  as their primary source of prey. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8050.820000000001s)]

*  is to fundraise for our international efforts [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8969.46s)]
*  because the only way to help out [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8971.619999999999s)]
*  with these animal worldwide is through me [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8974.38s)]

*  I would love to visit some places out there [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8987.82s)]
*  or just learn to get more involved. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8990.06s)]
*  We heard you can feed the hippos. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8992.3s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8993.82s)]
*  The feeding of the hippos, [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8995.06s)]
*  I believe they were earlier, [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8995.9s)]
*  they were like having some stuff in there [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8997.06s)]
*  and I had someone else, [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8998.9s)]
*  I thought we were going to be feeding the fish back in. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=8999.74s)]
*  But unfortunately some of our volunteers [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9001.26s)]
*  are already getting off that ship. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9003.78s)]
*  We have animal care specialists. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9005.1s)]
*  They're feeding the science. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9006.9s)]

*  And. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9265.7s)]
*  Size of a medium sized car, [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9268.46s)]
*  that can be 18 feet long. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9269.66s)]

*  He was like, I need a little bit of air. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9278.38s)]
*  But you were right about, like they can't swim. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9280.74s)]
*  If you went and put a hippo in the ocean, [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9282.74s)]
*  they would just sink all the way down. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9285.34s)]
*  And they do have to pop up to breed. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9286.94s)]
*  So, I mean, I assumed they would die in the ocean [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9289.060000000001s)]
*  because of salt water anyway. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9291.300000000001s)]

*  Yeah, he brought like four hippos over [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9299.86s)]

*  Okay, the mom can stay underwater [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9307.02s)]
*  for quite a bit longer it seems though. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9308.54s)]
*  Cause she's not, or whichever one, [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9310.66s)]
*  the one in the back is just like, hasn't really perked up. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9312.5s)]
*  Yes, the cocaine hippos. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9315.740000000002s)]
*  Well, they've escaped the estate and bred and reproduced. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9317.42s)]
*  Their tails are pretty weird too. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9321.54s)]
*  They're like, I don't know. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9322.740000000002s)]
*  Like paddle, yeah, paddle tails. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9323.58s)]
*  And they got like little spikes on it at the edge of it. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9325.740000000002s)]
*  Wonder what the utility for that is, little baby spikes. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9328.7s)]
*  They eat 70 pounds of food a day. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9332.300000000001s)]

*  Let's see, how long can a hippo stay underwater for? [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9341.62s)]
*  How long? [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9345.900000000001s)]

*  for about 40 seconds at a time. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9369.02s)]

*  I don't know. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9405.34s)]

*  Or they just have to be in a shallow area. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9410.34s)]
*  Apparently, hippos are dangerous [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9411.699999999999s)]
*  because they have sensitive hearing, poor eyesight, [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9412.82s)]

*  Nervous nature? [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9416.5s)]

*  So cool. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9504.34s)]
*  I think it's working. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9505.54s)]
*  Not pay special attention to their back feet [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9507.74s)]
*  because look at that. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9509.42s)]

*  Tigers first. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9535.14s)]
*  Oh, shoot, yeah. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9538.66s)]

*  Also, my battery's dying on my phone. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9555.42s)]
*  And I will be stranded [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9558.62s)]
*  if I don't have anything to charge it with. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9560.42s)]

*  God, animals are the best. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9564.66s)]
*  The okapi. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9567.62s)]
*  Oh, it's like the busted zebra giraffe thing. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9569.06s)]
*  Giraffe-ish, like male giraffes, okapi males, [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9573.18s)]
*  grow skin-covered horns called ossicones. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9575.14s)]
*  Armed rebels illegally hunt, log farm and mine [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9579.26s)]
*  and protect the forests of the Democratic Republic [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9581.42s)]
*  of the Congo, and the okapis vanish, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9582.779999999999s)]
*  and that is why they are disappearing. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9584.58s)]
*  They're endangered species. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9586.019999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9587.5s)]
*  They're so cool. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9588.46s)]
*  They're kinda horse-like, I feel. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9589.3s)]
*  Like their heads. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9590.699999999999s)]
*  They got a bit of everything. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9591.539999999999s)]
*  But their head looks more like a giraffe. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9593.14s)]
*  You see these boxes here? [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9595.619999999999s)]
*  And then their legs have the zebra, yeah. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9596.46s)]
*  These are like enrichment boxes. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9598.859999999999s)]
*  They have super long tongues. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9599.98s)]
*  They can put food in them, [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9601.26s)]
*  and then they have to stick their tongue in that hole [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9602.38s)]
*  So that is like a giraffe. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9605.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9607.02s)]
*  What haven't we seen yet? [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9610.460000000001s)]
*  We've made it. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9611.460000000001s)]
*  We've seen a lot. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9612.66s)]
*  We've looked at everything. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9613.5s)]
*  So tigers this way? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9614.94s)]
*  Oh yeah, we gotta look at the tigers. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9616.78s)]
*  She said there's a snow tiger. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9619.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9621.5s)]
*  I assume that's a rescue. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9623.7s)]
*  Well yeah. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9625.26s)]
*  Have you seen the chimp thing on Netflix [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9626.1s)]
*  that's like Tiger King but for chimpanzees? [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9628.62s)]
*  No, I have not. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9630.62s)]
*  Apparently it's great. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9632.380000000001s)]
*  Is that there's more tigers in captivity [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9633.619999999999s)]
*  in private owners in the state of Texas from Tiger King [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9637.179999999998s)]
*  than there are in the wild. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9641.179999999998s)]
*  He's crazy. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9643.38s)]
*  He's got all the facts. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9644.22s)]
*  I got facts for days. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9645.06s)]
*  I knew that before Tiger King actually. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9646.539999999999s)]
*  Not me. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9650.58s)]
*  I mean, I get it. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9651.42s)]
*  I get it. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9652.42s)]
*  Here's right there. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9655.179999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9656.019999999999s)]
*  He looks mad. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9658.779999999999s)]
*  My apple. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9661.14s)]
*  Doesn't pacing mean anxiety? [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9663.34s)]
*  Yeah, this does kind of look like pacing. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9666.06s)]
*  Oh, then snack, no way. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9668.019999999999s)]
*  I think you see the snacks right there. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9670.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9672.14s)]
*  Yo, my man's got ball cancer I think. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9674.38s)]
*  No, he just, that's just what they look like. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9676.74s)]
*  He's got triples. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9678.539999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9679.46s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9680.3s)]
*  He needs to go to the doctor. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9681.26s)]
*  What did you say? [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9682.5s)]
*  You need to say that. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9683.82s)]
*  How dare you say that again? [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9684.66s)]
*  I said he might have a medical condition [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9686.26s)]
*  in his nether region. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9688.099999999999s)]
*  Well, if it wasn't for that nether region, [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9690.939999999999s)]
*  there wouldn't be any baby tigers. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9693.5s)]
*  You're right about that. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9694.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he's enjoying himself too much. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9700.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9704.140000000001s)]
*  That's the first pacing I think I've seen today. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9705.42s)]
*  That could be a lot of things. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9708.060000000001s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily mean he's doing that all the time. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9708.900000000001s)]
*  He has his mouth open. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9709.74s)]
*  Like, he's like. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9711.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9712.58s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9713.66s)]
*  I don't think I'm wrong by the way, in my assessment. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9714.5s)]
*  I mean, I didn't really get a good enough look [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9717.42s)]
*  and I'm also not a veterinarian. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9719.060000000001s)]
*  He had three. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9721.1s)]
*  Like, he had three balls. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9723.06s)]
*  I mean, this habitat's pretty sweet. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9724.300000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9725.74s)]

*  So is there a snow one in here too? [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9728.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9730.58s)]
*  Wow. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9734.5s)]
*  This is a dope habitat. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9736.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty sweet. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9738.460000000001s)]
*  They have a cave down there too. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9739.34s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9740.42s)]

*  Look at all this climbing space, dude. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9977.980000000001s)]
*  So much vertical space, so many different branches. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9980.26s)]
*  You got a good vertical space for your little monkeys here. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9983.54s)]
*  Yeah, and they're much smaller. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9985.9s)]
*  But like this is sick. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9988.0s)]
*  Monk. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9990.66s)]
*  So cute. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9992.06s)]
*  The tufted kaputian. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9994.3s)]
*  I've lost chat, but. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9997.62s)]
*  That's great. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=9999.9s)]
*  Okay. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10001.14s)]
*  Look at the length of that tail, man. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10003.34s)]
*  Yo. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10006.54s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10007.66s)]
*  Dude, their hair is cool. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10010.12s)]
*  They must do a lot of upkeep on themselves. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10012.5s)]
*  That's crazy that the Angolan colobus monkey, [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10015.1s)]
*  they're in Tanzania and Kenya. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10018.5s)]
*  Their diet consists of leaves, seeds and unripe fruit. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10022.5s)]
*  Fun fact, colobus monkeys have reduced thumbs or none at all. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10026.300000000001s)]
*  The name colobus comes from the Greek word meaning docked [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10030.42s)]
*  or cut short referring to those thumbs. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10032.900000000001s)]
*  How do you, that's crazy. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10034.74s)]
*  That's an evolutionary L. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10036.900000000001s)]
*  Like how are you gonna be a monkey and not have thumbs? [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10038.54s)]
*  I mean, how, isn't that the whole point of being a monkey? [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10042.539999999999s)]
*  Is you got thumbs? [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10045.22s)]
*  I like these ones. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10047.46s)]
*  I guess they make up for it by having the coolest fur. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10049.02s)]
*  Like the winged. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10051.78s)]
*  Wonder if they gives them, [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10053.9s)]
*  you think that it gives them more flight time? [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10055.3s)]
*  Flight, like when they fly? [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10058.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10061.26s)]
*  Really? [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10062.5s)]
*  No. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10063.34s)]
*  No. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10064.18s)]
*  Why you gotta be like that? [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10065.0s)]
*  Why you gotta, I'm genuinely curious. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10065.84s)]
*  I'm asking you questions. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10068.3s)]
*  All right, cute. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10069.9s)]
*  They got a crazy look. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10072.26s)]
*  Smells terrible here. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10073.58s)]
*  It does, smells like monkeys, man. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10074.74s)]
*  All right. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10076.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10077.82s)]
*  At this point, we should start targeting the exit. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10078.98s)]
*  La la la. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10082.7s)]
*  Maybe we have to go back the way we came. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10083.86s)]
*  Probably not. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10085.54s)]
*  Maybe we should go up these stairs. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10086.38s)]
*  La la la. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10087.66s)]

*  Maya. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10092.9s)]
*  What? [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10093.74s)]
*  There's stairs right here to go up this route. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10094.58s)]
*  Okay. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10096.460000000001s)]

*  Western Central Africa. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10116.1s)]
*  Damn, they hunt these for bush meat too? [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10117.82s)]
*  What the heck is going on with the, [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10119.54s)]
*  what do they know that we don't know about this bush meat? [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10121.26s)]
*  Now I'm thinking maybe there's a valid reason to hunt them. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9slY1ICGhI&t=10123.82s)]
