**HasanAbi:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw)
*  Family Mart. How many Marts is it everywhere? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm a big, I'm bigger on 7-Eleven. I think so. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=2.4s)]
*  Okay, that's fine man. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  I know that you say that but it's important that I convert. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=6.8s)]
*  Look, look man, hey, that's fine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Like it's easy to get like healthy stuff at the V-nev and like fruits. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=11.6s)]
*  That is like an obscenity that breaks the American bread. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=15.4s)]
*  Like, it's easy to get healthy food at 7-Eleven. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=18.6s)]
*  Is that caramel? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=22.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was syrup. They don't really have like a... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=23.8s)]
*  I went to a Happy Pancake, they had syrup there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=27.2s)]
*  You said it wasn't good though. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=30.4s)]
*  I mean like, okay, I should... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  Every pancake is good. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=34.4s)]
*  So on a pancake scale, I would say that the souffle pancake breaks... [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=44.8s)]
*  I don't know what I was expecting from that stream. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=45.8s)]
*  It was so much better than I expected. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  I was definitely a little nervous in the beginning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=50.2s)]
*  I thought it was not gonna be like crazy content or anything. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  But I knew that if I place my trust in Kaho, that it will yield. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=57.2s)]
*  It will yield tremendous results. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=63.0s)]
*  She has not let us astray once. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=64.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=65.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=66.8s)]
*  No, that was so much better. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=67.8s)]
*  Thank you for making that happen. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=70.8s)]
*  It was a nice dancing session. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=72.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was amazing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=74.0s)]
*  Whenever it's me and Assam, we always put on for the boys, huh? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=79.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  Oh, you guys put on for the boys. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  Probably got like a... [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=84.6s)]
*  I'm guessing three upvotes, 70 comments on live stream fails right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=85.8s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=89.6s)]
*  Three upvotes, 70 comments. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  I'm just so tight. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=98.8s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=102.0s)]
*  That pussy's tight, huh? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=103.8s)]
*  In general. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=104.8s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=105.6s)]
*  That's what you meant. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=106.6s)]
*  Like my movement is very... [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  It's not very fluid. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=109.8s)]
*  I feel like in order to dance well, you gotta get fluid. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=110.8s)]
*  Goodness. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=114.4s)]
*  Whereas... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=116.0s)]
*  I didn't have that fluid. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  Tell me if I sound like Assam, ready? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Was that good? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=125.0s)]
*  That was me reacting to a video. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=126.4s)]
*  That was pretty good. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=131.6s)]
*  Sometimes I also do this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the chicken. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=136.0s)]
*  Speaking of which, I'm so f***ing hungry. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=137.8s)]
*  Mais and Assam is such an underrated duo. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=141.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  I f***ing love Assam. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=143.8s)]

*  I like him too. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  My boy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  He just came back two days ago? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=167.8s)]
*  Me? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=170.4s)]
*  Yeah, so I was playing World of Warcraft for three months straight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=171.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=173.4s)]
*  And then I got so sick of being inside that I just wanted to fly here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  So he wants to kind of like out of the whim. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=178.8s)]
*  Yeah, I bought the flight three days ago. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=180.4s)]
*  What? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=182.6s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=184.0s)]
*  I'm like a free bird, you know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=185.8s)]
*  Nice. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  How long? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=187.8s)]
*  I asked him how long you staying out here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  He said he does not have a return ticket. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=189.6s)]
*  When Trump put those tariffs on your ID card. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=191.4s)]
*  That's honestly the best way to do it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=192.4s)]
*  That is the best way to do it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=193.8s)]
*  And then he stopped you at immigration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=195.4s)]
*  You just go one way and then you just overstay your visa and then you become Japanese. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=197.8s)]
*  This is not advice. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  I guess you have to tell your hotel that how many days you staying. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=207.2s)]
*  However, I am Latino. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=210.0s)]
*  So I'm kind of... [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=211.2s)]
*  We can hang out. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm a little Latino myself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm Mexican. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=216.6s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=221.0s)]

*  Okay. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  Unless you want to play a retro game. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=231.6s)]
*  I get it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=233.4s)]
*  Hey, what's your favorite retro game? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=236.4s)]

*  That's my genre. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=240.9s)]
*  And I don't know if you have a little bit of a way to do it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=243.2s)]
*  I read that too. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=246.6s)]

*  How are the food portions in Japan? Small. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=2662.3s)]
*  That's definitely an issue [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=2664.3s)]
*  for me, at least. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=2666.3s)]

*  Come look at this, man. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3556.3s)]
*  Hello. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3558.3s)]
*  Wake and I... [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3560.3s)]
*  Wake and I... [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3562.3s)]
*  Just because you're not the face of [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3564.3s)]
*  politics anymore, you come after me like that? Yeah, that's [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3566.3s)]
*  true. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3568.3s)]
*  Wake and I last night [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3570.3s)]
*  went to a Wagyu spot [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3572.3s)]
*  that we thought was like a [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3574.3s)]
*  straight Wagyu spot, but it turned out it was actually [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3576.3s)]
*  a... What is it called? The [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3578.3s)]
*  Sukiaki Wagyu spot. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3580.3s)]
*  Sukiaki? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3582.3s)]
*  But it was fucking [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3584.3s)]
*  decadent. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3586.3s)]
*  Who picked it? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3588.3s)]
*  I just found it. We did the classic [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3590.3s)]
*  Google review. What I'm learning is [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3592.3s)]
*  you love a Google review. Oh, in Japan? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3594.3s)]
*  You gotta do Google review. It's actually that [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3596.3s)]
*  cool. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3598.3s)]
*  I just remembered. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3600.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3602.3s)]
*  Menu. I want to check out the menu. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3604.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3606.3s)]
*  Ah, I see. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3608.3s)]
*  I'll just look at the menu. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3610.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3612.3s)]
*  Are you hungry? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3614.3s)]
*  Do you want something? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3616.3s)]
*  Do you guys already eat? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3618.3s)]
*  No, we're just waiting for our food. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3620.3s)]
*  Okay, so this is the big... [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3622.3s)]
*  So we ordered [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3624.3s)]
*  pancake. We got the pancake. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3626.3s)]
*  We got the very expensive fruits as well. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3628.3s)]
*  Sandwiches. Wagyu's like this. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3630.3s)]
*  We got the very expensive... [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3632.3s)]
*  I got a melon for a hundred [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3634.3s)]
*  dollars. Oh, you got a square? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3636.3s)]
*  No, they don't have the... because it's only in season. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3638.3s)]
*  You can also order a drink. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3640.3s)]
*  Oh my god, they got hot berry tea. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3642.3s)]
*  That's exciting. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3644.3s)]
*  You got really excited about hot berry tea. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3646.3s)]
*  You got hot berry tea? Okay. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3648.3s)]
*  Oh, I got a tea. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3650.3s)]
*  I don't get hot berry tea. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3652.3s)]
*  But yeah, he ordered for both of us [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3654.3s)]
*  last night, one pound [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3656.3s)]
*  of wagyu. So we [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3658.3s)]
*  each ate one pound of wagyu. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3660.3s)]
*  Everyone else had like 300 grams. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3662.3s)]
*  And they were dying. 300 grams was too [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3664.3s)]
*  much. One pound was too much for me. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3666.3s)]
*  He's definitely ate over a pound. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3668.3s)]
*  Because he took on Arthur's, like half of Arthur's food. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3670.3s)]
*  I didn't want to say it, but I ate more than him. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3672.3s)]
*  It's kind of disgusting. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3674.3s)]
*  I ate Arthur's food. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3676.3s)]
*  And Shannon's. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3678.3s)]
*  Even if you ate all three of them. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3680.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, I guess it'd be more than a pound, right? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3682.3s)]
*  It's a kilogram. It's close to a kilogram. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3684.3s)]
*  Hungry, hungry or... [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3686.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3688.3s)]
*  I'm proud of you. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3690.3s)]
*  They just show me a lot. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3692.3s)]
*  Don't act like you're sad about this. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3694.3s)]
*  This is the dynamic. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3696.3s)]
*  And no one streamed this? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3700.3s)]
*  No. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3702.3s)]
*  You have cappuccino? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3706.3s)]
*  Wagyu is the most overrated cut ever. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3708.3s)]
*  Did A5 Angus clear any ships any day? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3710.3s)]
*  A5 Angus? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3712.3s)]
*  A5 was also [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3714.3s)]
*  Wagyu designation. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3716.3s)]
*  It was A5 Wagyu Surma. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3718.3s)]
*  Oh no, sorry. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3720.3s)]
*  I was just nodding. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3722.3s)]
*  Oh, street cards. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3726.3s)]
*  Have you done that in stream? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3728.3s)]
*  I don't think I can fit. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3730.3s)]
*  But that's why you literally look like Donkey Kong. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3732.3s)]
*  I also think it's like very [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3734.3s)]
*  annoying. People hate it apparently. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3736.3s)]
*  That's rude. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3738.3s)]
*  Saying Wagyu is overrated [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3744.3s)]
*  is so stupid. It's like [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3746.3s)]
*  objectively the greatest. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3748.3s)]
*  Okay, no, no. I got a take though. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3750.3s)]
*  I think Wagyu tastes [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3752.3s)]
*  really good, but I don't necessarily [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3754.3s)]
*  experience it in the same way I do [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3756.3s)]
*  steak. You know what I mean? Like it's so rich [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3758.3s)]
*  and buttery that if I want to steak, I wouldn't go to [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3760.3s)]
*  Wagyu. I would go to Wagyu if I wanted Wagyu [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3762.3s)]
*  specifically. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3764.3s)]
*  I didn't know Wagyu. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3766.3s)]
*  But a pound of it was actually [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3768.3s)]
*  psychotic. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3770.3s)]
*  I think you want to do a hot berry tea and [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3772.3s)]
*  a bowl of assorted fruits. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3774.3s)]
*  Did you guys already [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3776.3s)]
*  get your stuff? No, we haven't got our stuff. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3778.3s)]
*  No, no, we ordered. Yeah, we ordered [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3780.3s)]
*  fluffy ricotta pancakes and [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3782.3s)]
*  sandwiches. Fruit sandwiches. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3784.3s)]
*  You can try it as well. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3786.3s)]
*  I want to mix the other food sandwich. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3788.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3796.3s)]
*  4.1 and you're like going to have the best meal of your life? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3826.3s)]
*  No, 4.4. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3828.3s)]
*  Yeah, because you have 4.4 it's like... [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3830.3s)]
*  I said anything that's 4.4 and [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3832.3s)]
*  above will be literally [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3834.3s)]
*  one of the better meals that you've ever had. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3836.3s)]
*  And the place that we went to last time [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3838.3s)]
*  was a 4.9. Is that coffee? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3840.3s)]
*  Yes, and it was unironically [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3842.3s)]
*  good. So what they did, they separated [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3844.3s)]
*  it out of egg yolk and they shaved [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3846.3s)]
*  truffle, like black truffle on top of it. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3848.3s)]
*  They busted out the black truffle. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3850.3s)]
*  Right on top of the rice. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3852.3s)]
*  And then they keep putting it in the rice and then mix the rice [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3854.3s)]
*  together. It's so hot. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3856.3s)]
*  I do that too. It's the play. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3858.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3860.3s)]
*  I don't like hot coffee. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3862.3s)]
*  I feel like in America, where it's like 5 star, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3864.3s)]
*  1 star, 5 star, 1 star. There's no [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3866.3s)]
*  raiding. It's either like a sub 3 [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3868.3s)]
*  or like a 4.8 plus. And if something's [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3870.3s)]
*  like a 4.4 in the US, you're like [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3872.3s)]
*  do I go to there? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3874.3s)]
*  Here they're actually trying to [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3876.3s)]
*  have accurate reviews. Which is [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3878.3s)]
*  very nice. Integrity. Yeah, integrity. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3880.3s)]
*  Another way that you can kind of guess. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3884.3s)]
*  Oh, right, the truth is already in the body. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3886.3s)]
*  I was twerking. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3890.3s)]
*  They were great. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3892.3s)]
*  They croaked their ass off. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3894.3s)]
*  He actually won. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3896.3s)]
*  You won the twerk off? It was obvious. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=3898.3s)]

*  They need a hard take. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4560.3s)]
*  I like milk a lot. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4562.3s)]
*  Because I like milk and also have the milk icon. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4564.3s)]
*  Because they know [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4566.3s)]
*  their milk. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4568.3s)]
*  I like 7-11 food a lot. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4570.3s)]
*  And they have like fruit [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4572.3s)]
*  smoothies. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4574.3s)]
*  I would say 7-11. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4576.3s)]
*  And I'm not a family market. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4578.3s)]
*  How many markets everywhere? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4580.3s)]
*  I'm bigger on 7-11. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4582.3s)]
*  That's fine then. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4584.3s)]
*  I know that you say that but it's important that I convert you. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4586.3s)]
*  Look man, hey, that's fine. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4588.3s)]
*  See you need to get like healthy stuff [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4590.3s)]
*  at 7-11. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4592.3s)]
*  That's like an obscenity [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4594.3s)]
*  that breaks the American bread. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4596.3s)]
*  It's easy to get healthy food at 7-11. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4598.3s)]
*  Is that caramel? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4600.3s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was syrup. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4602.3s)]
*  They don't really have like a [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4604.3s)]
*  I went to a Happy Pancake, they had syrup there. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4606.3s)]
*  You said it wasn't good though. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4610.3s)]
*  I mean like, okay, I should [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4612.3s)]
*  every pancake is good. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4614.3s)]
*  So on a pancake scale, I would say that the souffle [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4616.3s)]
*  pancake breaks lower to me than a standard [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4618.3s)]
*  buttermilk. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4620.3s)]
*  We're about to find out. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4622.3s)]
*  It's very eggy. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4624.3s)]
*  It's too airy. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4626.3s)]
*  It's alright. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4630.3s)]
*  You see what I mean? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4632.3s)]
*  The traditional [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4636.3s)]
*  buttermilk goes harder than the American pancake. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4638.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4640.3s)]
*  Oh, I agree. I'm not a big souffle pancake fan. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4642.3s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, the spectacle is great. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4644.3s)]
*  It's the second time I've tried a souffle pancake [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4646.3s)]
*  and it's the second time I've felt disappointed. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4648.3s)]
*  But you got trapped back into it because [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4650.3s)]
*  it looks so good. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4652.3s)]
*  It just looks so amazing. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4654.3s)]
*  It's just the presentation and the fluffy texture that's kind of like [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4656.3s)]
*  the gimmick. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4658.3s)]
*  I would take like a blueberry [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4660.3s)]
*  pancake from a diner in America [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4662.3s)]
*  any day. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4664.3s)]
*  Have you had like a [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4666.3s)]
*  buttermilk American pancake? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4668.3s)]
*  Do you think it's better than the souffle pancake? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4670.3s)]
*  The souffle is very popular in Japan. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4672.3s)]
*  We have great cheesecake too. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4674.3s)]
*  We like everything airy. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4676.3s)]
*  Do you have food sensory issues? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4678.3s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4680.3s)]
*  When I eat food that I think is bad for you, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4682.3s)]
*  I think about it being bad for me. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4684.3s)]
*  When I'm done with that, I'm like [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4686.3s)]
*  fuck. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4688.3s)]
*  Ms. has a very similar kind of food brokenness [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4690.3s)]
*  to me. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4692.3s)]
*  It's like crystal mommy almost. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4694.3s)]
*  Crystal mommy? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4696.3s)]
*  Yeah. Like it's like superstitious in a way. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4698.3s)]

*  Battery three. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4714.3s)]
*  Some days they run out of plastic metal. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4716.3s)]
*  I agree. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4718.3s)]
*  Like how many hours have we been live? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4720.3s)]

*  Five hours? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4724.3s)]
*  I think like three or four. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4726.3s)]

*  I read that yesterday. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4784.3s)]
*  That made no sense to me because it was so [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4786.3s)]
*  boreal, I guess. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4788.3s)]

*  Do you ever play World of Warcraft? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4886.3s)]
*  I have. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4888.3s)]
*  Do you recommend it? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4890.3s)]
*  I have been playing it Octopus Travel. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4892.3s)]
*  Octopus? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4894.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4896.3s)]
*  Alright. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4902.3s)]
*  So we're not going to be able to try the fruits today, Chad. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4904.3s)]
*  But we'll do it tomorrow. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4906.3s)]
*  And also [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4908.3s)]
*  I haven't fully figured out what we're going to be doing tomorrow [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4910.3s)]
*  but we might be doing another [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4912.3s)]
*  dance class potentially. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4914.3s)]
*  A para para. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4916.3s)]
*  Do you know para para? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4918.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, the gyaru style. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4920.3s)]
*  A Japanese dance. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4922.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4924.3s)]
*  We might be doing para para with Ryan. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4926.3s)]
*  Is that a traditional dance? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4928.3s)]
*  No, no. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4930.3s)]
*  From 90's. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4932.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4934.3s)]
*  And we'll do the fruit taste test tomorrow as well. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4936.3s)]
*  These will come to marches. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4938.3s)]
*  I want an AI makeover. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4940.3s)]
*  We're not going to be able to do that. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4942.3s)]
*  Wait, what? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4944.3s)]
*  No. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4946.3s)]
*  This is an AI makeover I can get? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4948.3s)]
*  You want the thing that Hosanna got? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4950.3s)]
*  You went to an AI place? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4952.3s)]
*  No. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4954.3s)]
*  I didn't know it was an AI place. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4956.3s)]
*  They're actually getting a patent for the AI. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4958.3s)]
*  So we couldn't film the AI car. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4960.3s)]
*  Until like March. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4962.3s)]
*  You can film but you cannot. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4964.3s)]
*  Like streaming. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4966.3s)]
*  Oh, you can vlog it? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4968.3s)]
*  Wait, let's go. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4970.3s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4972.3s)]
*  Okay, I'll try to see if they have a reservation. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4974.3s)]
*  I'll be down. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4976.3s)]
*  Wait, are they going to fuck my shit up? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4978.3s)]
*  I mean, they did it to Hosanna. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4980.3s)]
*  I mean, just look at my eyebrows. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4982.3s)]
*  I mean, they did amazing right? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4984.3s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4986.3s)]
*  And also the stick and shave. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4988.3s)]
*  You don't have to completely get it. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4990.3s)]
*  They can do whatever. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4992.3s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4994.3s)]
*  But yeah, as always we got [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4996.3s)]
*  more stuff going on. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=4998.3s)]
*  Obviously I'll be doing my regular stream [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5000.3s)]
*  at the regular time. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5002.3s)]
*  Here's some fruits for you guys. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5004.3s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5006.3s)]
*  To Miskift, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5008.3s)]
*  Shibuya, March, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5010.3s)]
*  Wake in the last minute there. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5012.3s)]
*  Yeah, Wake, you fucking killed it today. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5014.3s)]
*  I'm really clutched up. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5016.3s)]
*  I'm going to [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5018.3s)]
*  make Miz a changed man [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5020.3s)]
*  by the time he leaves Japan. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5022.3s)]
*  We're starting slowly [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5024.3s)]
*  but surely piece by piece. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5026.3s)]
*  I'll carry your torch. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5028.3s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1OM_0EA1Xw&t=5030.3s)]
