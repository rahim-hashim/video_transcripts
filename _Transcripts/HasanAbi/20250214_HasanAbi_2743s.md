# The Chinese Century Is Here | Hasanabi Reacts to Gattsu
**HasanAbi:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU)
*  JD pond on dude. Yeah. I'd be running over being like, listen, if one China, everybody [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=0.0s)]
*  knows this America says it all the time. One China, baby China. Number one. Okay. China [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  has always been number one China. Number one Taiwan also part of China, Chinese Taipei. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=12.6s)]
*  I mean, okay. Let's watch Chinese dominance instead of the foreign minister. Let's watch [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=17.8s)]
*  the guts, the guts video. He's international student in my class was telling me about how [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=30.76s)]
*  his evangelical dad in Beijing believes that Trump was chosen by God to win the election, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  this victory is part of a larger divine plan to destroy the United States. Wait, where did I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  hear this? This is like a meme, isn't it? I've heard this before. Didn't someone in my community [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  tell me that or was it a tweet? Oh, it's a tweet. I cannot afford eggs. Therefore all immigrants [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=56.32s)]
*  must is a conclusion that some governments and people have reached throughout history, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=64.6s)]
*  such as Germany in the thirties, American now and Germany now as well. The reason why I like [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=69.48s)]
*  being Eastern European is because life in Eastern Europe, unironically, not even joking sucks. It [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=76.92s)]
*  is nearly impossible to live the life that a normal American or a German lives if you are from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=84.16s)]
*  this cursed place. And on top of this, you are constantly under the threat of war from Russia or [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=90.04s)]
*  with one of your neighbors minimum. People go to universities for 12 years to be a doctor or a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=95.56s)]
*  dentist just to make what an American or German cashier makes in a month. And while the cost of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=101.32s)]
*  living is cheaper, it's not like everything is a dollar here and rent is $2 and normal jobs are [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  within the range of $300 to $500 a month here. That much money isn't going to get you far even [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=113.12s)]
*  in fucking Dushanbe. So for me who was raised in this bullshit place, ruined by corrupt banks and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=118.88s)]
*  politicians constantly looting money from people to hear Americans complain that they can't buy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=124.64s)]
*  eggs from their single family homes with a Ford F-150 parked out front. It was genuinely boiling [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=130.28s)]
*  me. Now you know how it is. I made it out the hood, paid off my family's predatory bank loans, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=137.56s)]
*  and I'm good now. But that's because I was very lucky for the opportunity to do YouTube. The rest [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=142.72s)]
*  of my country and around 15 or so more are completely and most of the population lives [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=148.0s)]
*  with a dream of even making half the amount of money that an American Walmart guy made. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=153.32s)]
*  Okay. The difference is your costs are still adjusted to your shitty ass wages. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=158.48s)]
*  Like this argument is, this argument kind of falls apart when you realize that like, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=165.44s)]
*  again, as we looked at before, as we looked at yesterday, like 23% of the entire existing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=171.28s)]
*  labor force is making $25,000 a year in the United States of America where rents are like, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=179.08s)]
*  at minimum in the shittiest circumstances, you're living in the most broken down building. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=188.36s)]
*  You saw what the Venezuelan migrants were living in. Okay. In Aurora, Colorado, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=201.04s)]
*  we saw with our own two eyes the dire conditions of the slums that they lived in. How much were [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  they paying for said slums? $1,500 a month. $1,500 a month to live in a condition that is like barely [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  elevated from being homeless and living under the bridge. It is crazy. This country is on crack cocaine. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=230.04s)]
*  Okay. If you want to know if you can get Chinese residency now, you can look up your ancestors [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=237.12s)]
*  with today's sponsor was MyHeritage, the number one family history service. MyHeritage allows you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=242.88s)]
*  to search the 33 billion plus historical documents they have to find records of your family members. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=248.76s)]
*  And with instant discoveries, you can add an entire branch of your heritage to your family tree [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=255.2s)]
*  with a click of a button. For example, here is my family tree and you can find out a lot of things. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=261.24s)]
*  For example, here I found out that all the people who were related to me that were awarded medals [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  in the Soviet Union for their service. There were a couple guys with big gold medals, some silver, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=272.0s)]
*  and some bronze. Either way, I know that people related to me were not just sitting on their ass [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  all day drinking and we actually did good in fighting World War II, which was a pretty cool [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  discovery. You can also use MyHeritage to repair, colorize, and even animate old photos of your [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  ancestors, such as I am here with one of mine. And all in all, it's a pretty cool service for allowing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  you to discover your heritage along with a bunch of historical records just by searching up your [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=298.8s)]
*  last name and also with the instant discoveries tab. You can sign up. It sucks because I can't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=304.0s)]
*  even shit on Gatsu because he's Georgian. Like by virtually every single metric, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=309.12s)]
*  it is the one country, well, not the one country, but one of those countries that unironically is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=317.76s)]
*  worse than the United States of America. You compare the United States of America to like [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=324.0s)]
*  Cuba on life expectancy. Cuban life expectancy is higher than the American life expectancy, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=328.24s)]
*  despite being a much poorer nation. Georgian life expectancy is like 70 years old. So you can't [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=333.2s)]
*  even be like, well, at least your life expectancy or your literacy rates are higher. You can't say [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=339.36s)]
*  that Georgia has an incredibly low rate of everything. No, I'm not talking about Atlanta. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=344.4s)]
*  I don't know what, I don't know what Georgia beats out the United States on. I'm going to be honest. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=351.68s)]
*  Okay. I guess they're wonderful contribution to the world was a tiny man by the name of Stalin. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=358.0s)]
*  And that's pretty much a free trial and enjoy all the features. My heritage has to hold on. Let me, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=365.2s)]
*  we're going to find something. We're going to find something like Georgian statistics. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  We'll find something live expectancy 71 point 59. Oh, okay. America's like 77. So that's cooked. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. So there's nothing there. All right. Georgian home ownership rate. Oh my God. Okay. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=385.76s)]
*  Nevermind. Georgia cooks. Okay. We found it very quickly. Nevermind. We found it very quickly. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=394.08s)]
*  Okay. All right. It's 65%, which is still very low for post-Soviet countries. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=400.32s)]
*  Okay. But at least it's higher. Wait. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=408.32s)]
*  Is this the Georgia state? Oh my God. Oh my God. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  Bro says USA facts. Hold on. Hold on. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=431.2s)]
*  Georgian country home ownership rates. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=433.76s)]
*  Isn't us homeownership like 60%? Yes, it is. Where the country comparison compare [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=455.2s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Life expectancy and wait, what bro? This is not right. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=464.64s)]
*  Life life. Oh, inhabitants. Oh my God. Let inhabitants for life. Expected for males, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=474.64s)]
*  67 to 75 for females is 76 to 80. Okay. I didn't understand what was going on. I look, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=481.92s)]
*  was it looking at inhabitants average age, 38.3 38.9 birth rate, 13% death rate, 15%. Oh my God. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=491.52s)]
*  Migration rate, 0.54%. Okay. Civil rights. Okay. These metrics are bullshit. I don't care about that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=502.56s)]
*  economy, inflation rate, cost of living 30% to 100% USA, be 100% commercial tax contributions. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=512.88s)]
*  Average income is $6,700. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=527.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=537.76s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Where the is the, where, where, where, where, where hospital beds for 1000 [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=538.16s)]
*  inhabitants. Of course it's double the number of American physicians is also almost double the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=549.6s)]
*  number of American, but not double. Okay. Rates of HIV are a higher. Where's obesity? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=557.52s)]
*  Okay. But rates of rates of diabetes is lower smokers 31%. Jesus Christ. Okay. Where the is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=568.16s)]
*  the home ownership rate? Jesus Christ. Is it, did I miss it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  No, they don't have it on this. Okay. Is it cheat code? Is it cheat code? To be fair is a cheat code. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=591.92s)]
*  The one thing that virtually every, the one thing that virtually every post-Soviet country [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=604.4s)]
*  will have over us is the home ownership rate. It stays at 93%. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=611.5999999999999s)]
*  93% [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=615.68s)]
*  American home or home ownership rates are around 60. I think you as home ownership rate is a 65.6. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  So what did we learn about Georgia? We learned that they love to smoke cigarettes and they all [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  have homes. Americans, no homes. Or with the link in the description and [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=639.6s)]
*  discover your family secrets. Thank you for sponsoring the video. So looking at the majority [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=645.84s)]
*  of Americans voting Trump, because yeah, he's horrible to women and everyone that isn't a [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=650.88s)]
*  billionaire and also white, but he will make eggs cheaper just to have the egg prices rise again, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=656.0s)]
*  is absolute cinema. First of all, I know y'all don't even eat eggs. If Americans actually [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=661.84s)]
*  ate eggs and cared about egg prices, they will not have these obesity rates. You know how hard [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=667.6s)]
*  it is to be fat while eating eggs? Trump came into power and immediately started threatening [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  not Russia, not China, not Iran, but America's very best allies. Talking about taking back the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  Panama Canal, taking Greenland and Canada too. I will not let Americans take Hoser. Critical support [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=684.4s)]
*  to Fidel Castro's son against the Ameri-KK Khan regime. Not only threats, but actions too. He [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=691.76s)]
*  literally put a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, their neighbors and biggest trading partners. He's [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  literally shooting himself in the foot because he's bored and plus making everything more expensive [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=704.48s)]
*  for Americans. Because after you get the 25% tariff, it doesn't mean everything will just be [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=709.2s)]
*  $125 instead of $100. After things get imported, the resellers and merchandisers have to take their [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=714.48s)]
*  cut on top of that. So more realistically, a 25% tariff means everything Canadian or Mexican [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=721.52s)]
*  that would cost $100 usually now would cost more like $150. Same thing with Taiwan. He wants to put [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=727.52s)]
*  tariffs on their semiconductors. A place that has only existed because of America's support saying [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=734.0s)]
*  they would defend them from a Chinese invasion. First of all, we know how good America's promises [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=739.76s)]
*  are because they promised the same thing to Ukraine if they gave up their nukes. And look [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=744.88s)]
*  at their defense of Ukraine now, where they abandoned my goats to the point where Zelensky [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=749.12s)]
*  himself is saying that they haven't received 9 out of 10 pieces of equipment that was promised [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=754.24s)]
*  to them. Now Taiwan, the place where 90% of the world's chips get made that are the main parts [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=759.84s)]
*  of your car, laptop, fridge, TV, PlayStation, computer, Kindle, dishwasher, fucking literally [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=765.92s)]
*  anything electronic is being sanctioned. And if you're Taiwan, right? Why would you not think, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=772.16s)]
*  hold on, what the fuck am I risking an invasion from China just to sell to these that sanctioned [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=777.2s)]
*  me as if the chip shortage in the world isn't high enough? Trust me. America did not. I mean, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=782.32s)]
*  I mean, JD pond on dude. Yeah. I'd be running over being like, listen, if one China, everybody [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=788.0s)]
*  knows this America says it all the time. One China, baby. China. Number one. Okay. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=795.5200000000001s)]
*  China has always been number one China. Number one Taiwan also part of China, Chinese Taipei. I [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=801.2s)]
*  need this. So you're just shooting yourself in the foot for absolutely no reason. Probably because [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=807.76s)]
*  Trump is bored and also now wants to concentrate a lot of non-Americans into these camps. He wants [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=812.88s)]
*  to make concentration camps and I'm pretty sure he will too. And guess what? With deporting immigrants, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=818.64s)]
*  what percentage of your workers are not us born? Yeah. The difference between this and this, by [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=824.16s)]
*  the way, was quite literally that this is a reeducation camp, completely unacceptable. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=830.0s)]
*  They weren't being deported. I don't even think this is a photo from a actual reeducate, like a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=837.36s)]
*  Uyghur reeducation camp though. I don't, I think it's one of those things where people will point [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=842.56s)]
*  to it to be like, look at this photo or whatever, but I think it might've been like a, I don't know, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=845.84s)]
*  but I think it might've been like a drug rehab or a prison or something. They also undoubtedly being [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=850.8s)]
*  less torture than a Texas prison. Yeah. The funniest thing, the funniest thing about this, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=855.44s)]
*  by the way, the funniest shit about like any photo from, I mean, they all look like we was, by the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=859.84s)]
*  way, for sure. They don't look like Han Chinese at all, just so you know, but have you seen the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=867.6s)]
*  inside of an American prison is my question. Okay. Because let me tell you this right here [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=874.24s)]
*  is the classic example of, Oh, they have Gulags over there, but we, when we do slave labor, that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=883.04s)]
*  is constitutionally protected. That's actually good. I found the article to the photo. U.S. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=890.64s)]
*  accuses China of committing that against Uyghurs in Xinjiang. I don't think this is, I think this [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=896.9599999999999s)]
*  might not be a reeducation camp. It could be. They all do look like they're Uyghur. They don't look [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=902.7199999999999s)]
*  Chinese at all, but Western media is known to use whatever kind of photograph they, they find to [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=907.52s)]
*  basically, you know, also the reeducation camps are completely unacceptable and they existed 100% [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=913.52s)]
*  just so you know, having said that the difference between me and many people that defend the United [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=919.76s)]
*  States of America on the other hand, is that I think this is bad. And I think the American [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=926.0s)]
*  prison conditions are also bad. Many people on the other hand, many people on the other hand, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=933.76s)]
*  turn around and say, no, no, no, this is a specific kind of bad. You don't understand. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=940.0s)]
*  It's very bad. American prisons. Very good. We put, we need to put more people. We need to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=945.36s)]
*  put more people into our wonderful, cool prisons that are good. Anyway, immigrants, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=950.64s)]
*  what percentage of your workers are not us born? Probably half, about half. Yeah. If there were [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=955.68s)]
*  a mass roundup of undocumented migrants that you might lose workers, you might not have enough [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=962.32s)]
*  workers. Well, the question I asked, how they, what's good, how they going to do that within two [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=968.48s)]
*  days? It's kind of crazy when we're thinking about when we, when we cherish and celebrate the El [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=973.36s)]
*  Salvadoran criminal structure, like the criminal justice structure, which is insane, where they're [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  literally doing drag nets, 300 people in the same court process is just basically being permanently [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=983.84s)]

*  boat. And you're over here fucking talking about Israeli genocide of the Palestinians, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1061.92s)]
*  which is worse. Of course it's the Chinese coast guard spraying water on a Filipino fishing boat. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1068.88s)]
*  They're fighting on the Indian Chinese border with sticks. And you're here talking to me about [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1076.8000000000002s)]
*  invading a foreign country and killing a shit ton of people and shock and awe. They're fighting [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1084.4s)]

*  what America has done, which is totally justifiable and good and nowhere near as violent as the, the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1099.2800000000002s)]
*  Indo-Chinese border conflict that is currently being fought with sticks and stones. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1108.56s)]

*  actually be paid a normal salary instead of immigrants that were being exploited for cheap [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1129.84s)]
*  labor beforehand and being paid like shit, the egg prices are going to go up. It doesn't take a [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1134.32s)]
*  fucking genius to understand this, does it? Same thing with home ownership. Ignoring the fact that [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1139.28s)]
*  the housing crisis in the US is caused by motherfuckers just hoarding homes and treating [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJkdbgGtfU&t=1144.1599999999999s)]
