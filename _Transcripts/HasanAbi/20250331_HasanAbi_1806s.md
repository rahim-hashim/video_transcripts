*  that Israel has personally targeted and assassinated I will react to the as men [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=46.28s)]
*  a man a man gold animations in a little bit as hand mentioned funerals have been [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  held for the eight Palestine Red Crescent Society workers killed by [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=55.76s)]
*  Israeli forces near Rafa last week their bodies were only found and returned to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  their loved ones on Sunday Israel blocked recovery crews from accessing the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=64.12s)]
*  area for several days the aid organization says the targeted killings [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=68.52s)]

*  Canterbury in the UK always great to have you with us on Al Jazeera mr. nice [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=86.28s)]
*  thank you for your time firstly your reaction to this particular incident and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=90.16s)]
*  what we've heard from the UN official in that report about what happened it's an [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=94.52s)]
*  apparently shocking event to which the only defense offered by Israel is that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=102.84s)]
*  this was a case of ambulances and fire trucks being used to camouflage Hamas [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  personnel fighters that's a very bare assertion by them and it has to be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=123.2s)]
*  viewed beside I think the evidence which seems to be clear that the trucks were [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=130.64s)]
*  marked as Crescent trucks and the workers were in clothes that identified [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=136.4s)]
*  them as such guys to be fair to Israel they are the ones who actually hide [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=143.32s)]
*  inside of red Crescent ambulances so maybe they thought Hamas is doing the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=148.28s)]
*  same I'm of course not joking when I say that is something that Israel does which [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=153.4s)]
*  is also a but I'm not joking when I say that Israel did do this and it is a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=158.92s)]
*  horrifying you know followed up by October 7 galore every single day upon [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=164.96s)]
*  the Palestinians for the record yes every accusation for Israel is obviously [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=172.72s)]
*  a confession what we should always remember is that not only do people [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=185.04s)]
*  working in humanitarian aid enjoy the protection that all civilians in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=192.88s)]
*  conflict enjoy but they are further specially protected because it is a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=199.32s)]
*  crime if they are authorized personnel and in an international armed conflict [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=206.84s)]
*  it is a crime to a specific to attract them if they're involved in humanitarian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  assistance or peacekeeping missions as you've said Israel as we've been [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=220.12s)]
*  reporting Israel has admitted to opening this guy to the prosecution of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=225.92s)]
*  Bosnian genocide in fire saying that Hamas and Islamic jihad were using fire [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=229.0s)]
*  trucks and ambulances as cover I just want to note here that the UN's High [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  Commissioner for Human Rights told the Security Council in January that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Israeli claims of Hamas launching attacks from medical facilities are [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=241.44s)]
*  often that's how you know he's he's biased he doesn't like when Muslims are [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=244.96s)]
*  jaded a clear-cut bias for the record obviously duh he clearly has a bias here [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=248.64s)]
*  this guy is anti-semitism this guy is clearly Hamas of course a person that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  does not like other of Muslims is going to be against Israel vague and some [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=263.72s)]
*  publicly available information but even if that was the case doesn't the doesn't [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=269.4s)]
*  Israel have an obligation to warn the party to stop its misuse then it would [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=275.84s)]
*  have an obligation to warn them unless it had very specific reasons not to but [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=285.15999999999997s)]

*  son he is supporting he is supporting hum hum hours show that the likely outcome [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=349.12s)]
*  is proportionate in terms of my favorite one of course is is this classic [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=356.6s)]
*  Israeli accent the other day I saw a sign that say free parking and I thought [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=365.0s)]

*  military advantage gained as opposed to civilian casualties lost and that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=403.88s)]
*  doesn't seem to have been addressed in this case and rarely is and one of the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=410.84s)]
*  great difficulties that's going to confront for example court that would at [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=415.72s)]
*  first sight be capable of including this kind of event in its arrest warrants and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=421.04s)]
*  pursuits against people like Netanyahu one of the problems facing them is that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=430.0s)]
*  the evidence is always going to be very limited Israel probably will never [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=435.8s)]
*  release in detail its evidence that led to what it says was its thinking and the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=440.44s)]
*  other evidence comes from people on the ground to the extent that there were [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=447.8s)]
*  people and putting that together in order to prove the intention the state of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=451.2s)]
*  mind of the Israeli Defense Forces is always going to be very difficult so and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=456.96s)]
*  it's going to given what you're saying mr. nice that you know Israel will not [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  reveal its evidence that it has there might be a lack of witnesses I mean the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=465.2s)]
*  Palestinian Red Crescent has called for an international investigation it's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=470.52s)]
*  highly unlikely that Israel will allow people to conduct this what does all of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=474.24s)]
*  this mean bro Israel wouldn't even allow international organizations to conduct [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=478.08s)]
*  third-party investigations into the crimes that Hamas may have committed on [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=484.04s)]
*  October 7 like they they give so little of a shit there is no way they were [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=491.36s)]
*  like fuck no we're not letting you do that like it's it's insane there are [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=499.92s)]
*  also active lawsuits against the Israeli state for obviously ruining forensic [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  evidence like there are Israeli citizens who feel understandably wronged by this [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=511.76000000000005s)]
*  process so it's just you know there's no way there's no way that they would ever [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=516.72s)]
*  there's no way that they would ever fucking allow the investigations to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=525.64s)]
*  their war crimes for you know the for the laws around war crimes and the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=529.84s)]
*  system that's in place let me assume without expressing any opinion that this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=536.66s)]
*  action is the criminal action that you and your viewers may think it is but I'm [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=544.14s)]
*  not expressing an opinion if it is it's likely Hamas the biggest scapegoat they [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=549.62s)]
*  made Americans like Azmogold associate all the Palestine with Hamas is it that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=555.0s)]
*  people have anything to do with it yeah also once again I think that the part [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=558.5799999999999s)]
*  that people refuse to comprehend here is that Hamas in and of itself is not like a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=564.42s)]
*  totally separate identity from Palestinians they're not just like [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=568.9s)]
*  operating on their own okay it is entirely comprised still of [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=572.18s)]
*  Palestinians and this is an important distinction to make from the civilian [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  population certainly but it's also important to understand how it exists [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=581.18s)]
*  why it exists why people have felt it necessary to take military action [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=585.38s)]
*  against a fucking nation-state that has been occupying them for 76 years Hamas [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=591.62s)]
*  has a political party that is a civilian that has an entirely civilian [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=598.42s)]
*  purpose which is to to operate the ministries inside of Gaza Hamas has a [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=602.9s)]
*  military wing that is separate from the the civil governance of the Hamas [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=609.98s)]
*  political branch but having said that when you when you simply also remove [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=615.62s)]
*  Hamas from the equation and separate the Palestinian population from Hamas which [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=620.98s)]
*  is understandable to do because these are fucking civilians these are health care [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=625.42s)]
*  professionals and whatnot but but even then if you don't identify the reasons [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=630.06s)]
*  as to why Hamas exists then you will never understand it is a what oh okay [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=635.86s)]
*  this person was saying not cockroach in a racist way he was saying they're like [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=642.66s)]
*  what what is this what is he saying is a country of children and some [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=646.5s)]
*  fundamental cockroaches have survived all the Israeli bombs I think you mean [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=650.74s)]
*  like cockroaches and like that they've survived or are you what that's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=654.3s)]
*  confusing dude people don't fucking people do not just join up in arms [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=660.54s)]
*  against the Israeli state because they were like oh I read a religious [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=667.5s)]
*  scripture and I decided that like we have to kill all the Jews that is a [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=672.18s)]
*  fucking lie that the American government and the American media and the Israeli [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=676.4599999999999s)]
*  media hand-in-hand simultaneously presents as the only reason why these [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=680.5s)]
*  people are doing this it is insane if you always think that that is the reason [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=685.54s)]
*  why if you think that that is the only reason why Hamas exists you're fucking [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=690.7399999999999s)]
*  stupid that is not why Hamas exists and before Hamas was the fucking PLO [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=695.38s)]
*  comprised of infinitely more secular forces as a matter of fact and it [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=702.26s)]
*  didn't matter if you don't identify if you don't identify why there is militant [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=706.98s)]
*  resistance against Israel and that is because Israel exists as a violent force [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=712.82s)]
*  in the region you will never understand why new factions will rise up in the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=717.9399999999999s)]
*  process I am NOT an Islamist fundamentalist by any stretch of the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=724.02s)]
*  imagination as you know I mean fucking duh no shit this is not a conversation [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=727.86s)]
*  about Hamas's domestic affairs or even its its methods of of violence or what [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=733.14s)]
*  they choose to do this is analysis that revolves around why [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=743.46s)]

*  post that they publish because if you tell me this guy doesn't know what a [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=916.02s)]
*  genocide looks like then who knows what a genocide looks like I guess nobody [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=923.18s)]
*  only Israel knows what a genocide looks like and that was on October 7 that was [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=928.14s)]
*  the only genocide that's a real genocide an October 7 basically every week since [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=933.18s)]
*  then from Israel to the Palestinians is not a genocide because they deserved it [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=938.8199999999999s)]

*  October 7 happened if you think history started on October 7 well you're wrong [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtSiCUfmio&t=1025.86s)]
