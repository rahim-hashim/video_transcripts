*  protests in Japan, there's a big movement there, but [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=303.44000000000005s)]

*  Yeah [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  to be in the United States of America, so [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=314.16s)]
*  Just stay there for as long as you can I think but [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=318.0s)]
*  first of all, let me get started by saying I didn't know how to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  Like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=326.88s)]
*  Reference you because I feel like it's weird. You'd be like Elon Musk estranged daughter. Is that is that all right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay, good you okay, so I wasn't wrong. I still did it but I just want to let you know I felt bad doing it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  the absolute audacity of something yeah, I [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  apologize, but I just I don't know what like the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=346.28s)]
*  appropriate way to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=349.88s)]
*  Describe it would be you know what I mean? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=352.32s)]
*  a [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=357.0s)]
*  Nepo, baby [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=358.2s)]
*  No, I'm a nepo baby, too well, I guess I'm I'm a nepo nephew [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, your uncle is kankweaker. I looked up your Wikipedia [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  Weager janky. Oh you good [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=373.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's all good don't worry about it [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=380.2s)]
*  I read your Wikipedia page in preparation for this. Oh damn. I don't even know what's on there, but you know, it's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=382.48s)]
*  Probably not all the good things are real if there's anything bad on there. It's it's fake [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=389.5s)]
*  There's a there's a segment where [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=394.36s)]
*  Yeah, I've recently got banned for [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  Something that people misunderstood I was I was talking about the Republican hypocrisy on [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  you know [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=408.7s)]
*  caring about [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  Medicare fraud, but [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=411.36s)]
*  Anyway, that's not that's neither here nor there so [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  So you're in Japan? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=417.36s)]
*  You you have a lot of opinions and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=419.92s)]
*  You you started you started posting. I was it on threads initially. I think you started on threads [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah threads is interesting I sometimes [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  Accidentally click on it on my Instagram because I'm 33 so I still use Instagram [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=438.76s)]
*  sometimes there'll be something like [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=444.56s)]
*  Justin Bieber is is selling all of his properties in red states and moving out of the United States after [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=446.84s)]
*  Having a heated debate with Elon Musk and I'm like, I don't know if that happened, but I'm gonna click on it [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=454.08s)]
*  And I know I didn't because no one's mentioned Justin Bieber in like six years. So there's that first of all [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's I mean, I don't know I but that's just I think there's fake news on there too is what I'm saying [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  It's impossible to fake news is impossible to avoid it seems [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=472.91999999999996s)]
*  Even on threads, which is not surprising because meta is dog shit just as dog shit as Twitter [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=477.4s)]
*  Not as dog shit as Twitter, but [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=483.76s)]
*  Probably you are still pretty [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=486.96s)]
*  Right up there [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=489.84s)]
*  well [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=491.84s)]
*  We're kind of comparing [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=492.84s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=495.0s)]
*  But so you started off on threads you now post on tik-tok [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=497.0s)]
*  And [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  You have a lot of opinions. What do you what do you mean when you say you want to take on the right? I? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=504.35999999999996s)]
*  Didn't say that the people who wrote the Teen Vogue articles like that. Okay [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=510.76s)]
*  What do you think they met when they wrote that? I don't know just [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=515.9599999999999s)]
*  People are afraid of a woman with opinions [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=520.8s)]
*  I guess whatever that means, okay, that's fair [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=522.8s)]
*  So I [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=528.8s)]
*  I don't know how to broach this subject in terms of like like your level of comfort talking about [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=531.56s)]
*  Elon Musk in general. So if you if there's anything you feel uncomfortable by you don't have to answer it at all and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=537.76s)]
*  It's perfectly fine. Is it is it okay if I ask some questions like that? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  Is it is it okay if I ask some questions like that or if it's not then I don't [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=548.72s)]

*  Um, it was a weird [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1799.8799999999999s)]
*  Also, my favorite memories of that astra were we made weapons out of pvc pipes and then fought each other [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1802.04s)]
*  uh [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1807.24s)]

*  Okay [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1811.1599999999999s)]

*  It wasn't a part of anything we just had a bunch of fucking pvc pipe laying around [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1819.48s)]
*  so [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1824.52s)]
*  Being the 12 year olds we were we made weapons out of them and then fought each other [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1825.32s)]
*  Okay, and I was like [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1830.92s)]
*  I was like I made a trident and I was eating eating everyone up [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1833.0s)]
*  You should go and uh hit up the dojo. I went to [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1836.76s)]
*  uh in japan [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1840.12s)]

*  Put your put that put that fighting skill to test [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1848.68s)]
*  holy shit [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1852.6s)]
*  Um conundrums have been used in millions of classrooms in partnership with class dojo synthesis a venture-backed educational technology company founded in 2020 [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1853.8s)]
*  Is also based on the work of [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1861.0s)]
*  Astro nova, okay [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1862.82s)]

*  Elon moved it from the space x campus after that. So I guess it turned into an online school [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1870.52s)]
*  It turned into an online school as soon as my brother as soon as my younger brothers graduated which [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1875.96s)]
*  Uh after after uh, they said it wouldn't so you know, whatever whatever [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=1881.48s)]

*  Yeah, some people just kind of are the way they are, right? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4615.92s)]
*  So the the evolution do you feel like it it escalated like it became more overtly right wing? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4618.88s)]
*  Uh purely because like he overtly yes [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4625.6s)]
*  Uh because he felt free and unshackled from uh, the [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4629.12s)]

*  COVID are restrictions or is it like is it also brain rot because I I still remember like [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4634.88s)]
*  In the beginning of covet he had that famous tweet where he was like, oh, this is gonna be done by april [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4640.0s)]
*  Holy shit. Oh my god. I can talk about look one of the last interactions we ever had [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4645.599999999999s)]

*  Is that what that is? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4667.919999999999s)]
*  It's like cringe. It's so fucking cringe. The only thing I know about nine gag is they had that little stone in spain that was buried [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4669.36s)]
*  it was [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4677.04s)]
*  That's all I know about that [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4678.799999999999s)]
*  But um, yeah, no, I think it was uh, covet that really turned him to right wing people think it's like my fault [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4680.4s)]
*  Like I cannot take credit for that. Unfortunately for him becoming a fucking loon. I can say that no, I don't yeah, I don't think it's [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4685.759999999999s)]
*  No [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4693.44s)]
*  That's [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4694.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess people do say that I didn't even think about it [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4695.759999999999s)]
*  I feel so like no one no one thinks that by the way, I don't think anyone honestly thinks that [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4699.679999999999s)]
*  No, a lot of people honestly think that he became like more right wing because of pain because they're uh, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4705.759999999999s)]
*  Because it's like a character because people think we live in a fucking novel and this is like some tragic character motivation [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4709.76s)]
*  I'm like, that's not how that works. This is not like [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4715.52s)]
*  This is not a novel. So like grow up. I'm not the fault. I am not the reason [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4718.72s)]

*  This there's this underlying like aside from being like a shitty boss or whatever [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4737.52s)]
*  Was it always like we must restore a secure future for our white children style shit [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4742.64s)]
*  Or was it was that like a like a relatively new phenomena is what i'm getting at [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4748.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I couldn't say [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4753.68s)]
*  uh, I you don't really talk about [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4757.04s)]
*  you really don't talk about like [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4759.92s)]
*  14 words share with someone when they're eight [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4762.0s)]
*  I also didn't interact with him a lot and I don't remember my childhood [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4764.4s)]
*  Yeah, so there's that also I feel like if there's one person who would do that it would be him but [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4767.44s)]
*  Yeah, fair enough. Um, someone in the chat asked if you if you know the [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4771.84s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4775.44s)]
*  I've known he's been right wing since at least 2016, but I don't think he was ever left wing [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4777.28s)]
*  Yeah, no, he was he was saying he was a socialist [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4782.88s)]
*  But he's called trump when I was in the room [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4785.76s)]
*  I team-voked I said this to team-vogue and then they didn't put it in the article but um, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4787.76s)]
*  They were probably worried about getting sued [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4792.4800000000005s)]
*  He had a phone call with trump when we were in the fucking room [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4794.4800000000005s)]
*  I was playing heart stone because I was trying to farm the 30 wins you needed to get to get 100 gold [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4797.4400000000005s)]
*  So you could buy an extra pack for a day and he was just calling trump just in the fucking trump called him [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4802.88s)]
*  It's like while I was in the room and then I was like these bitches won't shut up. So I left. Um [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4809.04s)]
*  I probably should have stayed but to hear what was going on [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4814.72s)]
*  But I didn't um, yeah, no, I mean it's not that's not a secret either he was he was a part of the um, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4818.400000000001s)]
*  I think it was like the initial business council or whatever, uh publicly [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4825.280000000001s)]
*  in the [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4830.16s)]
*  What's up? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4831.4400000000005s)]
*  Something cringe and dumb and stupid. I don't fucking know what? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4832.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's not that that's not like you don't have to worry about that. You're not like leaking anything [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4835.6s)]
*  Uh, he was he was publicly a part of uh, he was publicly a part of like the initial like business council or whatever [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4840.320000000001s)]
*  Uh in 2016 and then he very quickly left it [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4846.72s)]
*  um, yeah, uh because I forget what it was there was like a there was like some disagreements, but I think it [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4850.24s)]
*  At the time there was still I think oh, yeah [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4856.72s)]
*  He left due to the paris climate accord pullout, which I don't think he gives a fuck about at all considering out openly [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4858.88s)]
*  I think it was just bad for his image at the time. Yeah. Yeah [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4865.28s)]
*  Because back then it was not fashionable to be pro trump. It was like everyone hated him like all the liberals hated him [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4868.08s)]
*  Which you know [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4873.44s)]
*  They don't anymore [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4876.32s)]
*  It was bad for like marketing a little [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4878.4s)]
*  Yeah, so [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4880.96s)]
*  Topped that's why I think the reason is [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4882.32s)]
*  Yeah for sure. So but he's always been like very image obsessed [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4884.879999999999s)]
*  So he was very conscious is what you're saying in terms of like how he portrayed himself in in the media [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  Yep. Yeah, okay. So in terms of like the [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4894.24s)]
*  The renewable energy shit like is this [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4898.72s)]
*  By your estimation. Do you feel like it's more so just a way to farm subsidies because they are like [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4901.4400000000005s)]
*  They were subsidy targets because every single business venture [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4906.64s)]
*  that him and and a kimball [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4911.76s)]
*  moscaz, uh engaged with has always been like [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4915.04s)]
*  Heavily backed by government subsidies, whether it be like the failed solar panel business or whether it be the car company or even space [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4918.4800000000005s)]
*  Sex oh, I don't think I could really say but like probably I couldn't say for sure though [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4924.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's what my guess has been but I don't know I couldn't say that with like 100% certainty [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4930.320000000001s)]
*  So take what I say with a grain of salt. No, it's all good. So in the teen vogue interview you mentioned, uh a bunch of things [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpawZljKBg&t=4936.240000000001s)]
