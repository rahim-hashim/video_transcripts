*  kind of subtly moving around a little bit. And you can do this by, yeah like exactly. So if you're [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7.2s)]
*  if we're taking a photo right now this would be one pose right now because your head's tilted, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=13.52s)]
*  your left arm is this way and this this arm you can't just yeah like move it yeah and then like [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=19.36s)]
*  you can hold your glasses yeah this is like a cool pose right now if you can imagine from [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=25.2s)]
*  where I'm standing. Right that's one pose. And then I would show your necklace a bit. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=31.36s)]
*  And you have really good items at home. I know this is a creepy thing you probably never heard. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=38.72s)]
*  It means I've never heard that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=43.2s)]
*  The IRL portion of the broadcast I turn it on the camera's on you. Hi chat that was so fast. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=50.88s)]
*  No warning huh? Yeah. How do you know I wasn't going to flashbang them with hog? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  I just knew in my heart in my heart of hearts that you wouldn't do that. You're right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=64.56s)]
*  Anyway hey chat we're going to my room where this is all taking place. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=74.16s)]
*  Where the magic is happening. Where the magic happens. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=82.48s)]
*  My completely sterile untouched room. All business. No fun is had in there. Okay. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=89.2s)]
*  Yeah. No you have an ass. All business he says. When they see my room like you can't fake that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=104.16s)]
*  What do you think? There's no motion in that. Wait hold on here show this. Okay hold on. This is the fit. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  This is the fit right now. Okay. Okay you kind of got that shit on. Tucked in or tucked out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=119.04s)]
*  In for sure. Really? Because this is not like a tucking shirt. This is normally [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  I would rock this with the undershirt. I simply don't have a I didn't bring any tanks unfortunately [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=131.76000000000002s)]
*  which is crazy. I think the tuck work I think it's I mean and we're splitting hairs I think both are [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=139.44000000000003s)]
*  fine. I think the tuck works. No and I need to show my best. You need to show your best. She's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=144.0s)]
*  gonna rip you a new one. What's the name of this person? Aya. Aya yeah. Okay. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  Okay. All right. I'm scared. Yeah she's gonna rip you a new one then. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=155.52s)]
*  Chat you might need to actually be nice to him after this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=166.0s)]
*  I hate this elevator card situation by the way. Yeah it just doesn't work. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=171.12s)]
*  This might be my card. It is your card. No oh it is your card. Damn it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=175.52s)]
*  We're stuck in the elevator. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=180.0s)]
*  It's been a short morning man. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=187.44s)]
*  Here. All right let's go. One last look. One last look before we. Give me your card back too. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=193.84s)]
*  Go ahead. It's scary. Here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=203.44s)]
*  All right you're showing numbers and everything right now. Okay no numbers. Yeah. I haven't had breakfast. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=207.04s)]
*  Me either. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=218.32s)]
*  But I never do. All right. All right I'm gonna hide my numbers then. Now you make me paranoid. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=221.36s)]
*  Do you put the two cars together? No. Oh. I put them in different parts. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=232.96s)]
*  I put them in different parts of my wallet. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=237.2s)]
*  I have a system. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=241.52s)]
*  Go for it. Wow. Hi. Nice first impression. Nice to meet you. Aya. Aya Hassan. Nice to meet you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=249.04s)]
*  Nice. Yeah. Hello. Okay. This is it. You. I'm very excited. I'm so excited. You're excited. Okay perfect. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=257.68s)]
*  So Aya if you don't mind. Is it blown out by the way? No it's good right now. Okay. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=266.64s)]
*  If you don't mind explaining who you are and what you do to my audience that would be fantastic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=271.28s)]
*  Do you want to talk your total background? Let's maybe take a seat here. Yeah that's probably best. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=275.92s)]
*  So hello. My name is Aya Jean. I dumped my last name after several divorces. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=282.88s)]
*  I'm a scout coach based here in Tokyo. I was born to a supermodel when I when she was 20 actually. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=289.92s)]
*  So my whole family was in this very peculiar world of modeling and in my 20s I bought my own model [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  agency from my ex-boss and I ran my own model agency with my sisters in it for say over 20 years. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=304.32s)]
*  So as I was telling you earlier I'm in the business of mostly non-verbal communication [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=312.32s)]
*  I would say. So what I'd like to do is utilize my skills and expertise I acquired from running a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=319.68s)]
*  model agency with hundreds of female models over the years to help not global change agents to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=326.48s)]
*  have a bigger impact and a bigger reach in the world. So that's my little way of contributing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=335.2s)]
*  to make the world a better place. That was an amazing intro. Okay that was awesome. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=340.96s)]
*  I don't know if I'm a global what did you say global agent? Global change agent. Okay I like [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=347.52s)]
*  that. All right well Aya I'm Hassan and I'm a political commentator on Twitch normally [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=353.84s)]
*  but also I love fashion and when we heard about this opportunity I was very excited. I was super [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  stoked because everyone always makes fun of my fits. Everyone says that like my I have bad style [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=368.8s)]
*  is what they say but I think since you're the consummate professional here you are the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=374.72s)]
*  final say. The final boss. You're the final boss of fashion so today just know that that is the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  responsibility that you have. The responsibility that you have is incredible. This is going to make [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=389.52s)]
*  it or break it. If you say my fashion is bad and my posture is bad and the way I carry myself is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=395.2s)]
*  bad it's over for me. I will never be able to live this down but having said that we heard that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=401.44s)]
*  we were supposed to bring our Sunday best, our best dress and of course we're in Tokyo which is [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=409.12s)]
*  you know the capital of fashion in many respects but unfortunately because I'm very big I can't [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=415.84s)]
*  really find clothes that fit me here. I did bring a lot of a bunch of my clothes here but obviously [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=422.16s)]
*  it's never going to be like the best stuff that I would have normally in LA in my closet but [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=427.04s)]
*  without further ado I don't know how you want to go about this but this is this is what I was able [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  to to bring out. Yeah I love it actually. I did get this here. Yeah and I wouldn't call myself a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  fashion expert per se but more about let's say making your H&M look like a product. It's more [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=444.56s)]
*  about how you carry yourself. So imagine if you're stranded on an island and your suitcase goes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=451.68s)]
*  missing you still want to have self-esteem and confidence and in the island on the island. Okay [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=457.2s)]
*  you don't want your life to be crushed because you forgot to bring that one pair of glasses that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=463.12s)]
*  you're attached to or your necklace. I mean I feel like I'd be looking for water but that's just me. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=467.68s)]
*  Yeah I think so just to give you my first impression of you. You're already blessed, you're tall, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=472.64s)]
*  you care yourself well and obviously you're interested in your style and perfect like eye [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=479.44s)]
*  contact. Thank you let them know. Yeah see really good they say autism all the time they're like oh [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=486.48s)]
*  you're autistic which I mean I guess that's true I am a little bit but uh you know I try my best. I [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=492.72s)]
*  can be I can do eye contact. Yeah yeah the whole key about pulling off like whatever style that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=498.64s)]
*  suits you it could be a female style anyway it doesn't matter it's about how you feel about [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=506.4s)]
*  what you're doing and knowing that you love that style. So for example I would say something about [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=512.56s)]
*  not wearing black because black takes away the impact you would have especially in a big room. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  So unless you're going to a funeral I advise men and women to avoid black. Oftentimes people [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=526.16s)]
*  wear black. Why are you pointing at me? Because you're wearing black. I wear a lot of black as [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=533.12s)]
*  well. I love so maybe let's get let's give you a seat over here just so I'm not pulling right through. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=537.92s)]
*  I love uh Japanese designers uh unfortunately I'm a little size restricted in terms of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=544.88s)]
*  using Japanese designers but um that's the reason why I wear black a lot actually I wear a lot of [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=551.92s)]
*  yoji stuff because I also like the silhouette. Yeah I love I love like a very cool uh interesting [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=558.32s)]
*  silhouette uh more so than just like even the different pieces that I'm wearing and because [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=565.5200000000001s)]
*  of my size I always have a very hard time finding like the the silhouette that is like uh supposed [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=571.7600000000001s)]
*  to look a certain way because like most of the most of the designers when they're making like [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  the key pieces they're making it for his size right so then like they just kind of size up [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=585.52s)]
*  off of that and given my I guess unique dimensions uh my arms are long I have very broad shoulders [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=590.88s)]
*  which is essentially everything that many guys would trade their right arm for. No I understand [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=598.64s)]
*  that but but for fashion it's not necessarily great because also look at it um tailored yes yeah [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=604.72s)]
*  but that's too complicated yeah it's too complicated yeah so actually also the model [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=610.88s)]
*  size is probably perfect for you have you contemplated switching yeah no I'm gonna [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna become a plus size model I think no but I think because you're tall that would actually [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=621.12s)]
*  be more on the model side so size so for fashion shows and you know the models they use I'd have [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=626.0s)]
*  to lose like I'd have to shave some bones you would I would have to shave my bones to be anorexic [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=632.4s)]
*  no I'm just saying like I'd have to get small I have to lose more weight and then also end up [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=639.52s)]
*  maybe even changing my dimensions a little bit because my because I would say my height is good [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=644.72s)]
*  yeah but I'm 6'4 so I think it's like 194 centimeters slightly too tall for modeling [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=649.92s)]
*  you know but I mean Tony Roberts is huge for example I feel like modeling has also changed in [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=657.2s)]
*  in like the last decade where they also do look for like unique looks in that sort [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=664.56s)]
*  and it's every decade it changes maybe I can do a kid super runway I think if you don't if you just [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  shut up and don't share what you thought of yourself or what people say this is really true like I would [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=675.2s)]
*  be able to start for a fresh so I'd love let me just share what I love like I think your five o'clock [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=681.04s)]
*  is gives me a really good impression and then eyebrows you have great eyebrows and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=687.92s)]
*  eyebrows are everything eyebrows make or break a first impression so it's not just that you have [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  thick nice creamy natural eyebrows you can use you can learn to use them to your advantage in saying [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=702.0s)]
*  things to be more impactful so imagine Obama before he gave his presidential speech before [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=711.04s)]
*  he uttered a word the way he came onto a stage well a person who understands their non-verbal [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=718.32s)]
*  communication has that impact so he's slow in walking he uses his hands to elevate his impact [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=724.24s)]
*  and get what he wants so for me like you have like you're like tall hands on this is like [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=733.52s)]
*  thank you right well I mean thank you I feel like I'm the one that gets to watch you so there's the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=739.84s)]
*  I feel like it's not in fact in Japan they don't they don't like a hairy big men but you don't [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=744.4s)]
*  come across as hairy I haven't seen yourself I mean I'm a hairy guy but for me I actually have [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=750.72s)]
*  a strange thing where I use the law of polarity which is an instant um up being elevating an impact [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=757.6s)]
*  so women kind of accentuating their feminine and men using their masculine and I don't mean you [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=764.64s)]
*  need to be macho or tall or buff you could actually use your posture like posing to look [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=771.04s)]
*  like you're fit suck your stomach in and then make sure you show the back for example with what you're [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=780.0s)]
*  wearing goes perfect with this kind of off-white couch so if you're taking a photo I would first [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=787.12s)]
*  of all not really sit in a chair ever so you're sitting sitting on this you know the front bit [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=795.52s)]
*  so you could keep your yeah exactly and then you want to look natural so yes so men would widen [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=801.68s)]
*  their stance yeah and make sure the left hand right right left leg everything is always doing [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=808.48s)]
*  something opposite like not the same asymmetrical yeah yeah yeah and you have good hands so you want [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=815.52s)]
*  to make sure you're showing that this in the video but this is a movie so you want to be [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=822.8s)]
*  kind of subtly moving around a little bit and you can do this by um yeah like exactly so if you're [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=829.36s)]
*  if we're taking a photo right now this would be one pose right now because your head's tilted [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=835.68s)]
*  your left arm is this way and this this arm you can't just yeah like a little bit yeah and then [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=841.52s)]
*  like you can hold your glasses yeah this is like a cool pose right now if you can imagine from [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=847.12s)]
*  where i'm standing right that's one pose and then i would show your necklace a bit and you have [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=853.52s)]
*  really good items at bow i know this could be a sting you probably never heard but this i've never [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=861.6s)]
*  yes so this the first thing i noticed five o'clock great chin great you have great atoms apple [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=866.64s)]
*  and this is another masculine feature that is you know unique to men so i would always show my neck [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  in some way or form and then your shirt's color is great you know and then you have probably you have [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=880.72s)]

*  thank you you come across as somebody that's interested in health and you look um like you're [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=896.56s)]
*  cautious which is great i am yeah yeah so this is all good jewelry great i'm not sure what this is [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=903.12s)]
*  like this is a it's a free palestine okay okay it's a political uh statement okay so the one [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=910.24s)]
*  thing i would try i love your necklace as well this is really unique so i think it's a local [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=917.12s)]
*  designer in la oh wow yeah so that i would say is you have a conversation piece right you have [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=922.32s)]
*  this is a conversation piece in any way this is your conversation piece as well [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=929.04s)]
*  but um it's not fashionable but you know i'm just gonna you know share yeah and then this has got to [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=933.6s)]
*  go oh i know this is so this is attached to my hip basically uh i my hip is an expression um i [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=938.64s)]
*  it just it's i always have it on and i know i have to take it off when i do photo shoots all the time [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=947.84s)]
*  but uh even then like look you can see how much i wear it from the fact that it's white do you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=954.0s)]
*  notice now there's like a tan line on it um and it's because i i monitor my calories and i monitor [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  my daily uh activity and my steps and everything else because i am health conscious i know it's not [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=966.88s)]
*  fashionable but i do uh wear it all the time regardless so i guess like for me um yeah i do [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=973.04s)]
*  make some let's say uh sacrifices in order to not maximize my fashion to the to the highest degree [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=981.92s)]
*  yeah uh but in an effort to you know showcase either my personality or my political opinions [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=991.36s)]
*  but then also simultaneously you know engage in this uh well this is cool yeah [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=997.2s)]
*  look at that so all this in my opinion is strictly based on your first impression [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1003.6800000000001s)]
*  and having an impact so the rule of thumb to me in style is to make sure your more you pull off [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1011.2s)]
*  something that's impractical and uncomfortable but make it look comfortable like there's nothing [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1020.48s)]
*  comfortable about this like heavy necklace it's comfortable to me i'm not even thinking [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1027.28s)]
*  or heavy buckle like jewelry these things are what most people who don't wear jewelry you know the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1031.2s)]
*  reason they don't is because it's like impractical it's heavy like none of this makes any sense [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1036.96s)]
*  my hat your all your glasses your necklace um cool clothes oftentimes like a pair of white pants [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1042.48s)]
*  now no no show socks you know like things that are typically stylish or at least the ones that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1050.72s)]
*  give us like whoa the well factor aren't really practice tabbies yeah i got the margiela tabbies [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1057.28s)]
*  i wear them all the time but they make my i mean it's hard it's hard to walk in them [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  yeah but you don't walk in them that's my thing it's like girls too don't walk in your heels [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1069.84s)]
*  from the station to the hotel no this is literally you carry them in a little bag [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1075.76s)]
*  look for a club arrive early i mean i was wearing like a lot of under shirts and everything i arrive [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1081.84s)]
*  early i take them all off do my thing get my photo taken whatever you know do the photo shoot do the [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1088.08s)]
*  video then you know wear your scarf we're live all day though and we're walking around a lot so [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1094.4s)]
*  that's why i try to find a if you notice like i'm wearing pretty basic shoes right now these are cute [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1099.8400000000001s)]
*  but yeah it works with the with the color scheme but the reason why i'm doing that is because i [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1105.0400000000002s)]
*  know like later we're going to be traversing the streets of tokyo and so i i do try to find a decent [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1110.16s)]
*  balance i'll explain it in my haircut as well for example um i don't do my hair at all i don't style [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1116.88s)]
*  it at all this is just i get out of the shower and then i dry it and then i let it sit yeah and [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1122.4s)]
*  the reason why i do that is because like i get a haircut is the exact same way because i want to [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1129.52s)]
*  make sure i'm min maxing i'm making it as efficient as possible so that i'm spending the you know i'm [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1134.48s)]
*  spending a limited amount of time like the as minimal amount of time as possible with a lot [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1141.44s)]
*  of the stuff so that i don't have to worry about it but this is my thing so if you're men and women [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  if you if i were to do the whole transformation package i would take you to a hairstylist not just [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1152.0s)]
*  the top hairstylist but he would show you what he thinks will look good for you what do you think [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1158.48s)]
*  looks good i'm not this is the interesting thing people ask me this all the time but i know that [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1165.04s)]
*  it could be better but i'm not a hairstylist so my job is to take you to the person that took me [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1170.8s)]
*  decades to find but always ask the right question to the right person right you don't go to like a [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1175.92s)]
*  brad pitt's hairstylist and ask her about if you don't look like that so this is where a lot of [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1183.28s)]
*  laymen mess up they pay a lot of money to an expensive photographer and they wonder why they [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1188.96s)]
*  didn't it didn't really come out the way they want well hello you didn't do the posing lesson [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1194.24s)]
*  facial expression lesson you took your own clothes you coordinated your own stuff so there's not [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1200.16s)]
*  much of a doubt for yeah and it's me yeah so this is where i come in so then i think one thing is i'm [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1205.84s)]
*  big on like dressing differently for time place and occasion so with your hair the efficient hair [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1212.6399999999999s)]
*  no one needs to know that that's what you that's why but you can literally carry around like this [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1219.28s)]
*  portable like a comb and you literally need water yeah you can gel it back with a little gel there's [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1224.3999999999999s)]
*  so many little things especially in japan you know that all you have to do is lick it on it's [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1232.16s)]
*  like a little gel that'll like keep your hair in place for 20 hours you can wear a cap you can wear [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1236.5600000000002s)]
*  a hat you can wear your glasses over your head you could you know paste it middle side and then [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1242.0s)]
*  you'll literally you could be out all day but you look like you're making an effort and it literally [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1249.0400000000002s)]
*  a one minute awareness that you might not have been aware of before to look like you're [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1255.2s)]
*  not out all day yes you you might be live streaming all day but it does not take much effort to carry [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1263.2s)]
*  an extra little comb or little you know gel thing or different pair of glasses a hat and have a little [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1269.76s)]
*  bag you know to coordinate so you don't have to go back to your hotel to wear that thing by this [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  thing you just learn to pack better and put things together better so like jewelry this all cool [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1283.92s)]
*  right and then so if you had like a party or dinner later you could try the gel have you tried gelling [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1290.16s)]
*  i hate gel you hate gel but is there another um spray or something i just like don't want to put [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1296.4s)]
*  any stuff in my hair in general like a knit i wear hats yeah i wear beanies yeah but then it messes [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1302.64s)]
*  up my hair so when i take it off then it's like not good so then can you keep it on depending on [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1308.32s)]
*  yeah for example how about sunglasses these are transition okay so like when i when i put it out [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1314.32s)]
*  in the if i put it out by the window still it'll turn uh purple here i'll do it right now [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1322.1599999999999s)]
*  see efficient i'm noticing a trend here i'm saying don't be efficient don't look efficient [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1330.1599999999999s)]
*  yeah no no but but but the trick is it doesn't look efficient yeah but it is it is cool let's [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1336.88s)]
*  see if it turns out here i don't know if there's enough sunlight yeah but it's getting darker so [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1343.2800000000002s)]
*  um okay so what out of all of this like what is what's good what's bad what would you change [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1348.8000000000002s)]
*  i'm not keen on this it's a bit baggy so i would um for example you're from l.a so if you're [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1356.0800000000002s)]
*  looking for something casual like james purse has really nice earth color um casual have you heard [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1363.2s)]
*  of james yeah like it has like a nice you know meaningless pockets and it's kind of like slim fit [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1370.0800000000002s)]
*  so like because you're fit you might as well see that's the silhouette though the reason why these [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1377.28s)]
*  are uh uh junior watanabe collab with carhartt i believe the wip collection and i love these pants [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1383.44s)]
*  because they're very like they're they're very free flowing yeah um but they also have the the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1390.88s)]
*  carhartt uh rugged yeah like they're they're structural in the sense that like they don't get [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1397.0400000000002s)]
*  ruined easily but it's uh it's it's what i was talking about with respect to the silhouette [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1404.16s)]
*  right like i i like that it's like you know i feel like this is very in fashion at the moment [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  like big baggy pants yeah i mean if you like it then i think stick to it it's still big though [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1414.48s)]
*  i mean the pants when i bought them fit me but i lost some weight yeah so to me that looks a little [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1420.16s)]
*  bit baggy that part also um i would go with a different colored pair of sneakers because it's [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1425.52s)]
*  kind of close similar to your parents so then because you're doing such a great job here like [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1433.04s)]
*  adding three colors which is like my real fun as well i try to employ these three colors instead [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1439.12s)]
*  of two most people just like all black or like red and white and then everything's red and white [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1444.56s)]
*  but you're using like all the earth color tones and then it's like all the way here and then this [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1449.9199999999998s)]
*  one could be something like bordeaux i don't know what colors you like but i just don't have it with [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1456.1599999999999s)]
*  me oh great yeah something different that's in the um what would if what if would black go with this [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  or is that too much of a juxtaposition i think black goes with everything people say i i don't [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1468.6399999999999s)]
*  recommend black for any reason in the beginning because good thing i didn't wear any black today [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1474.24s)]
*  yeah and you don't know anything about me so yeah like i'm quite um but at the end of the day you know [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1479.68s)]
*  then i like it when people are like okay i love this yeah and people use design for example one [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1487.2s)]
*  shoulder off like something cool fabric might be cool or you just love issei or you just love [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1492.72s)]

*  using different colors you know that coat's cool super nice this is actually something i would [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1503.28s)]
*  recommend like a grand plaid yeah it's really stylish this is sense or stein not sense uh is [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1507.76s)]

*  stick within a certain confine because i feel as though um you know sticking out too much is not [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1543.6799999999998s)]

*  trying to i'm trying to like go against it a little bit i think though if you're gonna do it [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1556.0s)]
*  you have to commit to it so either like go all black and try to be invisible but then you still [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1560.48s)]
*  are seen by the way you know yeah not the self but i think that this kind of uh [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1565.92s)]
*  indecisiveness part kind of shows when you're too much i'm already tall i'm already you know [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1574.0800000000002s)]
*  japanese people are much smaller i want to be humble but we already see you so you might as [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1579.92s)]
*  well look the part and it doesn't mean you have to wear you look like a clown but i think you look [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1585.76s)]
*  very stylish so you might as well like let people wonder who you are when you walk in so what would [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1591.28s)]
*  you say about this like i come in i walk in okay well this isn't even fully because it's not fully [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1598.48s)]
*  outside yeah but this is like a little bit in the transition i walk in like this what are you [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1605.28s)]
*  rating it one out of ten i think it's really nice and stylish and you obviously look like you're [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1610.08s)]
*  you might be someone and you already have a natural and you're doing the five o'clock [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1615.76s)]
*  intentionally so this is all working for you you look like a movie star like wow okay oh no he's [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1620.64s)]
*  never he's never gonna look he's positive yes yeah it's not not a big deal guys stop exactly [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1627.68s)]
*  so when you do all that posing i would really go wide i know it's against your nature to stick [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1639.44s)]
*  down but you just want to come across confident in your humility so you don't want to like you [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1644.56s)]
*  know like play it down if you want to like i think naturally i am like that though like natural no no [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1650.88s)]

*  so we were just trying to be extra meek and respectful yeah but i mean but i think naturally [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1674.4s)]
*  i am that way anyway so then the only thing is like maybe your hair it's like it doesn't look [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1679.44s)]
*  yeah it's but it's neither like the intentional rough casual look so i would just i mean it could [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1686.4s)]
*  be water you're okay with the water yeah yeah so then maybe just wet it a bit so it looks like [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1693.52s)]
*  you're doing something again i'm not a hairstylist also i would do like do you like wear glasses on [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1699.1200000000001s)]
*  your head and stuff or no no i mean i have to see yeah i wear glasses to see this is like [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1705.04s)]
*  adding a different for a photo you can do or even for yeah for a photo for a video for different [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1712.0s)]
*  looks just to expand without doing anything different you can wear that that way you could [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1718.48s)]
*  sling it you know i would also try like a hoodie like under your coat do you like like a thin um [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1724.16s)]
*  so you get like the extra side view yeah i don't really like hoodies that much i mean i have hoodies [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1731.28s)]
*  i wear hoodies sometimes but i actually i don't know why i don't like hoodies over the coat like [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1738.24s)]
*  i don't like having a hoodie no no i don't like having the hoodie uh head pop over the coat i do [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1744.5600000000002s)]
*  but yes this is personal preference yeah also uh how about like um what's called muffler uh the neck [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1750.16s)]
*  like knit um add color like a scarf kind of yeah like a scarf you could double like you could use [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1757.28s)]
*  double but you could also have a scarf that again like what you're missing a little bit in [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1764.16s)]
*  this earth color tone i would say the reddish or you can do that's interesting i was gonna wear a [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1769.28s)]
*  red and white scarf that i have where is it it's downstairs i can go grab it and come back to be [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1774.4s)]

*  yeah i was gonna wear it but i thought maybe it's too much no i think i like the too much too much [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1785.28s)]
*  no no but but what you're doing are going with subtle colors so it's very masculine very subtle [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1790.0800000000002s)]
*  very sexy so i would i think whatever you think is too much i haven't seen the red scarf but this [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1795.44s)]
*  is working so i think the red bordeaux like that tone would add a bit more like okay i can i can [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1802.24s)]
*  bring it in a minute i think that's fine um okay what else was i gonna do so we're we're gonna do [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1809.44s)]

*  because this is something i coach i literally teach my male clients to do things like this [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1821.9199999999998s)]
*  intentionally when they're on zoom for example you could have even if it's a 2d you could really [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1828.1599999999999s)]
*  use your hands and you have to literally start thinking what is the other person thinking of me [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1835.28s)]
*  so the mantra i share with my not so confident boys is you know to because people don't know what [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1843.76s)]
*  you're thinking so always think like i know you want me bitch this is literally some mantra i teach [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1852.1599999999999s)]
*  guys who aren't very confident and they were like what i'm like yeah that's what i said just cool [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1859.2s)]
*  when you were looking at a woman like you know i know you want me i think the reason why i do this a [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1864.3999999999999s)]
*  lot like when i'm thinking when i'm speaking and i use my hands a lot when i'm doing that is because [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1869.36s)]
*  of that because i so i am not like a normal human in the sense that i'm in front of the camera [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1875.4399999999998s)]

*  awake i mean like literally almost half of the entire year so i speak for a living professionally [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1888.32s)]
*  for eight hours every single day so i think i've just like developed certain habits naturally [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1893.36s)]
*  without really realizing just to be interesting do you think for the audience i just just do it [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1897.92s)]
*  i'm fidgety yeah i'm just fidgety but this isn't a fidgety yeah i love that he smiled so this adds [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1902.8000000000002s)]
*  it's interesting to watch a person with different facial expressions different moves different style [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1909.6000000000001s)]
*  right if you're if one's looking for someone like you and thousands of people pop up i don't know [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1917.52s)]
*  what you google to find you but then you want to be so eye-catching that a person would [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1923.28s)]
*  subconsciously at least like want to want to see yeah when you search me hasam minhaj comes up for [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1930.72s)]
*  example and now i'm going to be more eye-catching than you hasan that's right watch out i would add [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1936.8s)]
*  like more smiles so whatever makes you laugh do you use humor in your conversation sometimes [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1945.52s)]
*  yeah so i would use i would say things to make you laugh out laugh out loud to yourself it doesn't [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1951.92s)]
*  matter what the other person is thinking a person who is able to crack up crack himself up is a very [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1959.1200000000001s)]
*  charming person don't you think yeah i agree a girl with a sense of humor yeah right it's it's [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1967.1200000000001s)]

*  you know i think it's good to bring myself down a little bit otherwise they think i have a big head [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=1994.0s)]

*  in that environment it's very difficult to communicate with them effectively it's just so [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=2114.48s)]
*  loud so i would i think i would just like do stuff like that and uh and i like unintentionally [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=2120.0s)]
*  because i had this yearning to talk to them to be able to communicate with them without actually [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=2128.3199999999997s)]
*  being able to communicate with them so i think that's where i picked it up but that's great [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=2134.56s)]

*  that you started so young you know got to start young with the brows y'all yeah but the others [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3805.68s)]
*  the other thing you're really lucky with is in japan um i discovered eyebrow salon in my early [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3811.04s)]
*  20s as well and right now in my stock coaching i take people to eyebrows guys and girls but the [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3817.84s)]
*  women evidently 80% of women ask to tone down the high arched eyebrow where i'm taking my clients [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3824.96s)]
*  to show them arched because every celebrity every winner has high arched eyebrow look check this out [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3833.68s)]
*  it's high arched eyebrow is shaped like this so angeline naturally i mean you look at celebrities [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3843.04s)]
*  now you'll never look at a poster the same but then you also have bushy natural looking [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3850.24s)]
*  eyebrows so if they're not thin which which makes us feel like you're not only a confident person [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3855.6s)]
*  but you're a healthy person so if you have really thin hair whoops if you have thin hair of you know [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3863.2799999999997s)]
*  our lashes or like eyebrows it's just your impact lessens that much so one of my male clients for [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3871.68s)]
*  example i noticed first thing i noticed was that his eyebrows were really thin and colorless like [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3880.48s)]
*  red but borderline white and then eyelashes were also colorless like albino so it's the first thing [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3888.7999999999997s)]
*  i did was take take them to the eyebrow salon and i asked them to for the clients to learn how to [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3896.32s)]
*  style their eyebrows for tv and stage and also for casual and date so the person is you know can do [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3903.52s)]
*  their own thing i think that's a thing with men that they don't think they should style especially [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3911.28s)]
*  straight men yeah straight men they get weird about yeah they think they're going to come out [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3916.96s)]
*  like weird one line yeah like i always try i will sneak with my tweezer do you grab a scarf [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3923.12s)]
*  when we're in bed and he's walking he's like playing a game i'll come in with my tweezer and just [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3929.12s)]
*  for his eyebrows just to get a couple because he doesn't he doesn't like me to touch them but [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3935.52s)]
*  i'm like just need to get these yeah the misplaced ones yes yeah but i think for men like it looks [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3941.36s)]
*  yes he's very well groomed yeah but then i would intentionally make it less [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3949.36s)]
*  groomed does that make sense so i would make it make more disheveled yes on purpose to do it on purpose [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3955.2s)]
*  art of subtle eyebrows yeah so anyway your eyebrows uh you obviously know what you're doing [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3967.92s)]
*  and it's great it's it's uh beautifully um featuring your other top features on your face [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3975.6s)]

*  lips yeah i was gonna say lips and then you got these dimples i used to hate my dimples when i was [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3992.56s)]
*  young and then like that right yeah well and then i remember moving to los angeles and people were [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=3997.92s)]
*  getting dimples surgically yes yes surprise people would come up to me when i first knew [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4002.56s)]
*  delango where did you get your dimples done yes that is the most la thing ever is someone will [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4008.16s)]

*  like crazy but that's what i always felt badly for the people with you know breasts like natural [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4023.92s)]
*  breasts because it's like well they must think i will just parked up at that people [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4030.48s)]

*  were well endowed when they were younger it was tough you know 12 13 years old roped by creeps [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4046.16s)]
*  um [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4053.04s)]
*  so um maybe divert a bit here so your top three features you mentioned would be the ones i also [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4062.2400000000002s)]
*  would point out but you can add variety for your hairstyle okay and makeup and facial expressions [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4069.92s)]
*  and things like that right so when you're you're doing videos as well streaming yeah yeah so what [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4077.84s)]
*  what do you do um now pre-me that keeps the audience engaged imagine people watching you [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4085.92s)]
*  without being able to hear you why would what do you do subconsciously or consciously to keep them [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4095.44s)]
*  engaged so earlier hasan and they were talking about hey like he uses his hands naturally [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4102.72s)]
*  he just grabbed this i'll get him in his earlier days or do you want to get him in a club [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4109.12s)]
*  you can't engage them with his communication so there's things people do to to to draw [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4114.400000000001s)]
*  yeah people and keep people to their own okay let's see first of all i'm going to put this on do not [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4122.320000000001s)]
*  disturb because that is driving me nuts hold on one second all right so i think [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4128.08s)]
*  on so do you want me to start on stream or in person anything okay for me i learned a a firm [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4139.44s)]
*  handshake when i was when i was younger so i you know firm handshake and then eye contact [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4147.5199999999995s)]
*  but not in a way where i'm like staring yeah uncomfortably into your soul [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4155.04s)]
*  and i think if you want me to i will and i think just exuding strength yeah so that was something [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4159.5199999999995s)]
*  my grandma taught me so i'm chinese on my dad's side so my papa was a very small woman but [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4169.92s)]
*  she was very she was she was very powerful a very powerful woman who every word she would say was [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4177.84s)]
*  was one she considered she didn't just speak to speak now with streaming a lot of times you speak [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4188.32s)]
*  just to speak because you have to you know fill hours and hours but it was also it was the way [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4195.84s)]
*  it was also it was the way she she carried herself to just you know her shoulders [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4203.76s)]
*  strong shoulders and like aldrie heffburn our mother yes where you see women who are very small [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4211.12s)]
*  in stature but very dangerous but but what william but very sorry please hold [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4218.88s)]
*  oh [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4227.76s)]
*  oh yeah just get back and she she told me she said being tall was good yeah because you look down on [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4234.4s)]
*  people that's why literally i was like the heels must be like 12 inches long you know like tall [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4241.44s)]
*  and it's like oh you can't walk in them please don't one please don't walk in your heels and [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4249.6s)]
*  it's like it's just naturally the moment we wear tall heels we feel we're looking down on people [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4255.2s)]
*  and it's a good place to be yeah so so with chat [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4263.28s)]
*  yeah i think it's i don't know it's an interesting question of how how to keep [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4270.16s)]
*  how to keep people's attention [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4278.72s)]
*  i think it's a version of how i am in real life but you know most of the time you're sitting at a [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4280.24s)]
*  computer and there's nothing else going on so there's not really many distractions so it is [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4290.5599999999995s)]
*  kind of easier to focus on you know whoever's whoever's streaming but yeah i would say just [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4297.76s)]
*  i would say just those those things but for camera and um i don't know if people get out of line [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4305.52s)]
*  sometimes sometimes i we've i'm new to this we all have very different styles so if [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4315.52s)]
*  people get out of line if there are people in the chat who are let's say they need to be reprimanded [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4322.96s)]
*  then still be they'll be reprimanded but i like to do it in a way where i was a teacher once too [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4331.200000000001s)]
*  so sometimes you lose your patience and you just snap at them sometimes i'll use a very demeaning [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4340.08s)]
*  baby voice if they're being a baby but other times it's just um it's repeating back to them what they [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4349.6s)]
*  have said so that they can hear how ridiculous that they are wow yeah so interesting what you do [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4359.04s)]
*  i'll say did you hear i said i'm gonna read back exactly what you said so that you can understand [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4365.28s)]

*  cute you like the scarf oh i didn't expect it to be like that i thought it would be like a more of a [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4375.36s)]
*  like a thick knit yarn maybe this is also political yeah so it holds a statement [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4381.84s)]
*  of political significance yeah i love it because i was talking earlier about how it's important to [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4389.84s)]
*  have a conversation piece but he has quite a lot so at any point a stranger sitting next to you [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4396.48s)]
*  can have something to talk to you about instead of oh you're a hot guy who are you what do you do [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4403.76s)]

*  using trains yeah under yeah and it'll be cool if you found something subtle not so like a hat [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4479.28s)]
*  or the whole uniform but there might be something i don't know a whistle train train pass i think [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4487.76s)]
*  i'm trying to show people less that i like trains and the opposite of what you're so you want [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4494.96s)]
*  something settled it's so core to your person it's probably the thing i think we're good oh okay so [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4501.4400000000005s)]

*  go okay stream i will say we started off strong when i started streaming and then we just devolved [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4529.76s)]
*  into whatever was very cozy because i stream at night and you stream for a long time so [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4538.32s)]
*  it's it's a lot of sweatpants i will say they can't see the pants though most of the time [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4547.5199999999995s)]
*  but yeah comfort is what i ended up going for in the case i would feel that would work for you [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4555.12s)]
*  because from my first impression you look too poised you look too perfect oh you know it's not [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4565.28s)]
*  necessarily a compliment okay right it's like uh i had i had some models like this we can't picture [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4574.88s)]
*  her people used to say we can't picture them without their makeup off so it looks too um so [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4581.68s)]
*  i think having this sweat look the natural the night look the night look nice that's my [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4588.16s)]
*  night creature look yeah yes but just adding variety so the viewers can [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4594.4s)]
*  enjoy what you're not saying as much as what you're saying through style and that would be [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4602.32s)]
*  you know changing your hairstyle your makeup your clothes the color the jewelry [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4610.64s)]
*  background where you're in tokyo for you know for example so you have so many options but [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4618.4s)]
*  i literally choose the backdrop depending on what i'm wearing like like if i'm wearing this you know [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4624.96s)]
*  like oh this works or like you know you look great on this couch that's what i'm saying and he looked [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4631.76s)]
*  great on this couch too and you look great on this couch well okay well you know what [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4637.04s)]
*  negative yeah nothing listen to him he's not just negative about himself do you notice this [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4644.0s)]
*  he just exudes negativity i think that caroline as beautiful as she is yeah and as vibrant of a [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4650.32s)]

*  person the moment you open the door that people feel you it's before they even look at you to be [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=4746.72s)]

*  shape as well but yeah that's something you probably find lots of interesting [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5020.400000000001s)]
*  glasses that are peculiar to tokyo like to japan that [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5025.280000000001s)]
*  so i always would wear black because i would do like a bold lip or a bold nail color or you know [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5032.64s)]
*  a funky hat or something so i always thought you know no it's not that i'm afraid of color [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5041.76s)]
*  i love red i love red but i just thought if i'm doing these extra things then i [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5049.4400000000005s)]
*  i don't want to be i don't want it to be too much yeah you know yeah but what's your like do you have [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5058.56s)]
*  like for example big necklaces that are colorful or big funny funny bags like for our shoes that [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5069.04s)]
*  it's in itself like an art piece a couple but i also am practical so especially if i'm buying [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5078.0s)]
*  something that's that's higher quality it's nice i tend to buy the basic color yeah that's a mistake [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5086.16s)]
*  i think okay mistake is a strong word but for brand name stuff people tend to if they [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5095.28s)]
*  you know save thirty thousand dollars the first you know that they'll buy would be a black [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5102.16s)]
*  air mass black you know or signature but i think it's so much more impactful if it is the life [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5109.84s)]
*  but it's like a completely useless color you can not neon green yeah or anything where it's like [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5120.96s)]
*  how the hell do i you know match this but that's the point yeah the point is to go with the most [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5130.0s)]
*  ridiculous like impractical color or size like a clutch bag shouldn't fit anything [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5137.36s)]
*  besides like q-tips right the bag is not to hold things in it no no heels heels are not meant to [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5143.76s)]
*  be locked on yes i can't i have a really hard time with heels because i used to also work in night [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5152.0s)]

*  you don't have to be walking around in them but i think shoes is you know one of the top three ways [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5211.36s)]
*  shoes bags yeah little places where we can see more about her like oh so when you look at [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5218.88s)]
*  someone's shoes does it tell you does it tell you about them especially in japan because we are we [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5228.320000000001s)]

*  people forget about having to take off the shoes sometimes so it's um something i think japanese [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5267.04s)]
*  are much more careful about just because we're in this situation yeah like in my case i'm not as tall [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5273.679999999999s)]

*  how you might look in person right so you you came out all perfect so i'm trying to imagine [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5421.92s)]
*  the casual or the more relaxed and said you want a coffee we have expresso or i can call down [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5430.64s)]

*  are working on or you want help on i yeah i am not a person who [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5453.12s)]
*  who necessarily does a lot of photo shoots or anything like that so mostly it would just be [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5461.52s)]
*  like head shot sessions for when i was acting and whatnot but yeah i think the posing i think a lot [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5471.76s)]
*  of people feel awkward though posing it's a natural feeling yeah so i think i i think because you have [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5479.92s)]
*  so much awareness women typically does a pretty women are very much more very aware yeah so yeah [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5487.84s)]
*  i think a lot of it was the photos that i took a quick suite that were great but i felt like [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5496.0s)]
*  clothes wise it was very simple so there wasn't that color in in a bag or funky like heels or [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5503.84s)]
*  hair piece or a hat or something so i thought that was something maybe okay with if you're [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5516.64s)]

*  and also your hand looked uncomfortable in some of the photos yes often it's hard to know what [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5529.12s)]
*  to do with your hands so same with him that something that you can bear in mind is to be [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=5535.84s)]

*  That's a advanced move on those who know for women. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6270.36s)]
*  It keeps their mouth open all the time on purpose [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6275.36s)]
*  to look alluring and welcoming. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6280.4s)]

*  Natural for you. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6316.04s)]
*  Large teeth and a smaller mouth. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6316.88s)]
*  So from when I was a child, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6318.92s)]
*  it was always just a lot of teeth, small mouth. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6321.679999999999s)]
*  So I think, honestly, I think that's why it's just, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6325.799999999999s)]
*  I don't even know I was doing it. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6328.88s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6330.44s)]
*  So this is something I explain, [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6331.28s)]
*  especially for women with small mouths and thin lips. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6333.4s)]
*  It just doesn't come across as friendly [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6337.4400000000005s)]
*  when you're always pursing your lips. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6341.200000000001s)]
*  And you have thin lips or small mouth. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6342.96s)]
*  So I would just recommend trying to make sure [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6346.200000000001s)]
*  that your lips are as wide as possible, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6349.6s)]
*  even if you're not physically smiling. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6353.08s)]
*  That also to keep it not pursed. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6355.400000000001s)]
*  Because it comes across as unfriendly. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6358.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was big lips, small mouth, big teeth. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6361.88s)]
*  So it always felt very. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6365.8s)]
*  Small circle. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6367.08s)]
*  But that's great. Big money. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6368.6s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6372.0s)]
*  I don't even know what he's saying right now. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6373.320000000001s)]
*  Just, you know what? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6376.92s)]
*  We are gonna, okay, okay. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6378.72s)]
*  So mouth open, good. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6380.6s)]
*  Mouth open, really good. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6382.52s)]
*  Mouth open, good. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6384.2s)]
*  And then you can explore, experiment with facial. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6385.72s)]
*  Is there somebody you follow that you accept [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6389.08s)]
*  aside from Zendaya? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6391.360000000001s)]
*  It's really just her. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6393.24s)]
*  She's perfect. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6394.84s)]
*  She's perfect for posing, for facial expressions. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6396.08s)]
*  Yeah, everything's just perfect. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6399.44s)]
*  Like I've watched videos of her [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6400.96s)]
*  where she's walking along with Tom Holland. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6403.24s)]
*  And then. Towering over him. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6406.32s)]
*  I love it so much. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6408.48s)]
*  I wish I could wear heels again [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6410.96s)]
*  so I could just tower over you. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6412.12s)]
*  You can. I know. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6413.72s)]
*  You're allowed to. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6414.88s)]
*  Bad feet, bad feet. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6415.96s)]
*  I know, but shoes not for wearing. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6417.8s)]
*  Shoes not for wearing. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6421.04s)]
*  Shoes not for wearing. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6421.88s)]
*  Shoes just to be worshiped. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6422.72s)]
*  But she does, she's remarkable. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6424.8s)]
*  Where she'll just, you know, blah, blah, blah. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6426.56s)]
*  And then some paparazzi will yell, Zendaya. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6428.08s)]
*  And she snaps into a pose. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6430.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6436.28s)]
*  I wonder what pose. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6437.12s)]
*  She just is, it's also just the way she looks. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6438.56s)]
*  But yeah, I've watched videos where she's walking, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6441.84s)]
*  you know, they're going to dinner or something. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6444.44s)]
*  And then paparazzi show up, they start calling her. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6446.36s)]
*  And she'll just like one, two, three, four, you know. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6448.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6451.88s)]
*  And then keeps going. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6452.72s)]
*  Like it's just, she doesn't even think about it. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6453.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6457.96s)]
*  I mean, maybe she is thinking about it. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6458.8s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like that would be really useful for you. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6459.64s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6462.320000000001s)]
*  For any, for whenever you're, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6463.160000000001s)]
*  no matter what you're wearing, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6466.4800000000005s)]
*  is there something that I could show you [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6468.120000000001s)]
*  that could, something you could do [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6471.120000000001s)]
*  that would be useful for you? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6474.72s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6475.92s)]
*  If I were to pick one sequence. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6476.76s)]
*  It's literally like a five second. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6479.84s)]
*  Like as in, like you want me to show you Zendaya [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6481.52s)]
*  or you want me to, or you want to show me. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6483.2s)]
*  I want to show you something. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6486.24s)]
*  Yes, please. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6487.08s)]
*  That you could use. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6487.92s)]
*  Please. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6489.76s)]
*  So I guess the question would be when do you feel stuck? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6490.599999999999s)]
*  Like when do you feel, oh shit, what do I do now? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6494.32s)]
*  Do you have, like I wish I knew how to pose better [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6498.48s)]
*  when I'm walking on the street [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6501.96s)]
*  or how to pose when I'm not, when I'm sitting on a chair? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6503.32s)]
*  I think sitting, sitting, cause I'm like, okay, legs, arm, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6507.16s)]
*  I don't know, you know, slouched. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6513.12s)]
*  I don't want to hit the, cause that's what's amazing. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6517.28s)]
*  You hit just like one tiny wrong angle [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6518.92s)]
*  and picture looks terrible. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6521.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6525.32s)]
*  So as we discovered, if you do a video first, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6526.599999999999s)]
*  just practice with a video. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6529.72s)]
*  Yeah, and then you come up, you come across [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6532.12s)]
*  nervous when you're stiff, when your hands are stiff. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6535.92s)]
*  So what I would recommend is just use something, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6539.6s)]
*  whether it's your sunglasses. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6542.64s)]
*  Just like hold something. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6543.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6544.88s)]
*  No, but not like that. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6546.64s)]
*  Oh. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6548.360000000001s)]
*  Like that, yeah. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6549.200000000001s)]
*  You're gonna, you're at a place where you could be like, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6550.320000000001s)]
*  yeah, exactly, right? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6552.64s)]
*  You don't have to. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6555.280000000001s)]
*  So be slack, just be like, oh, don't hold, hold things. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6556.76s)]
*  Just be slack and you can hold it. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6563.240000000001s)]
*  You know, whatever. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6565.76s)]
*  Oh, is he coming today? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6567.76s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6569.76s)]
*  Tomorrow I'm gonna eat for dinner. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6570.8s)]
*  Yeah, so that kind of. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6572.76s)]
*  Who am I? [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6574.28s)]
*  Who am I? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6575.12s)]
*  And you had all those little lines, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6575.96s)]
*  which I thought was funny. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6577.96s)]
*  What the, I hate you. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6579.8s)]
*  The shut up, yeah, yeah. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6581.8s)]
*  Yes, I've had a lot of practice. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6583.12s)]
*  Hating men. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6586.4s)]
*  So, let me do it there. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6588.92s)]
*  Let me do it there. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6593.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6595.6s)]
*  And then let's see what he can do. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6596.4400000000005s)]
*  I would use all this for some color. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6609.04s)]
*  Props. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6611.24s)]
*  Yeah, props. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6612.08s)]
*  You wanna take a video of me? [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6618.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6620.28s)]
*  I'll do a five minute, five seconds. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6621.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6623.92s)]
*  Yeah, this is. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6638.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6639.4400000000005s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6640.28s)]
*  She's got it down. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6641.12s)]
*  God damn. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6643.32s)]
*  That's it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6654.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6654.96s)]
*  Just, but imagine, so that's like probably [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6655.8s)]
*  10 different things I did. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6657.96s)]
*  And every move is really subtle. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6660.0s)]
*  And a pose to pose pose is always the best pose [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6662.76s)]
*  for a premature. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6666.4s)]
*  So you just wanna be like moving, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6667.96s)]
*  not drastically, but slowly from one pose to the next. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6670.64s)]
*  So, because we have the glasses here, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6677.52s)]
*  it was like, you wanna do the feminine moves, right? [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6680.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6683.16s)]
*  Leg. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6684.16s)]
*  Maybe both hands. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6687.2s)]
*  Maybe lay back. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6689.48s)]
*  Maybe cross my legs that look this way. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6691.88s)]
*  Dangle. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6695.2s)]
*  Maybe over the head. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6696.88s)]
*  Maybe dangle. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6699.08s)]
*  Maybe hold hand, hold both. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6701.24s)]
*  I kinda like, it doesn't matter, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6706.72s)]
*  but it has to be a very slow move. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6708.04s)]
*  Both the left hand, right hand. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6712.12s)]
*  And prop fusing is just gonna make your hands look [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6715.0s)]
*  like they have something to do. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6719.4s)]
*  So I would recommend that one for you. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6721.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6724.28s)]
*  Let me do it, do it. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6726.24s)]
*  Oh, I guess you're using that. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6727.48s)]
*  No, you can use it, hold on. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6728.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6734.28s)]
*  So. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6736.36s)]
*  It's gonna be a video. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6737.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure this will look exactly [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6738.599999999999s)]
*  like what you just did. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6740.5199999999995s)]
*  It's so cute. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6742.12s)]
*  Go. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6744.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, so we want asymmetrical. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6745.92s)]
*  You're doing it, relax. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6748.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6751.2s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6752.4800000000005s)]
*  You look great. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6753.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6754.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6757.52s)]
*  Yeah, you're looking asymmetrical. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6758.72s)]
*  That's good. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6761.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you can, perfect. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6762.4400000000005s)]
*  You gotta put the thing in your mouth, like she did. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6764.16s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6766.56s)]
*  What? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6767.400000000001s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6768.240000000001s)]
*  It's coming, it's coming. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6769.360000000001s)]
*  She's going, I'm throwing off. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6770.2s)]
*  And point your toes so that it doesn't look nervous. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6775.24s)]
*  Yeah, even though it's not comfortable. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6778.08s)]
*  Yeah, tilt your head, look that way. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6780.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6783.32s)]
*  I'm gonna try the sunglasses. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6785.36s)]
*  Yeah, and make the moves much slower. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6789.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6792.16s)]
*  Do you wanna do the coffee? [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6794.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6795.679999999999s)]
*  I feel like I'm moving like a swan. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6799.32s)]
*  Yes, that's the idea, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6801.28s)]
*  because that pose to pose to pose [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6803.88s)]
*  will be the ones you could use. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6806.88s)]
*  Surprise, surprise. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6810.32s)]
*  Got it, you got it. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6812.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6813.839999999999s)]
*  That's good, yeah. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6814.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it feels tiring in the beginning, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6815.5199999999995s)]
*  but I would recommend taking videos [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6818.96s)]
*  for 10 seconds, 15 seconds, everywhere you go today. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6821.44s)]
*  And then find a screenshot, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6825.36s)]
*  and make sure to, when you're moving, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6827.88s)]
*  change your facial expression ever so slightly, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6830.36s)]
*  change your left, you know, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6833.28s)]
*  the left and the right arms different. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6835.5199999999995s)]
*  Maybe you're doing the walking pose. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6838.2s)]
*  Maybe you're doing the sitting pose. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6840.96s)]
*  Maybe you're doing the leaning, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6842.4s)]
*  leaning, you know, on the wall pose. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6843.599999999999s)]
*  So I have a question. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6846.5199999999995s)]
*  How come every time I have him take photos of me, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6848.08s)]
*  I feel like they're not good? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6851.12s)]
*  Oh. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6852.72s)]
*  Then don't have him take photos. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6854.96s)]
*  Oh. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6857.040000000001s)]
*  Literally, when you're here, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6858.6s)]
*  use people on the street. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6860.76s)]
*  The young people are so good at taking photos. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6862.56s)]
*  So, and probably, I don't know, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6866.360000000001s)]
*  you're Will, right? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6869.6s)]
*  I'm Will. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6870.56s)]
*  He's Will. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6871.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know Will, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6872.240000000001s)]
*  but maybe he doesn't have the aesthetic sense [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6873.200000000001s)]
*  to see the whole picture. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6876.160000000001s)]
*  So when you tell him to take a photo of you, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6878.88s)]
*  what you really should ask is like, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6882.12s)]
*  a photo should always be like the entire image. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6884.92s)]
*  You're just one, you know, one little prop here. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6889.28s)]
*  So it's better not to ask a person to take a photo of you. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6893.48s)]
*  It's really important that maybe you even show [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6897.12s)]
*  a sample photo of what you want it to look like. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6901.2s)]
*  And, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6905.72s)]
*  I'll see if I can show you something. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6909.04s)]
*  Then just copy that, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6912.96s)]
*  whether it's a luxury brand poster. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6914.12s)]
*  I need you to make me look like Zendaya Will. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6916.84s)]
*  That's just the wrong way to ask for it. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6919.28s)]
*  I'm not a miracle worker. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6921.64s)]
*  Damn. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6923.72s)]
*  That's just the wrong way to ask for it. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6925.5199999999995s)]
*  I've done a miracle. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6930.32s)]
*  I've been thrown out of the bus a lot today. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6931.16s)]
*  Look, these are these, like I do, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6933.16s)]
*  I take just screenshots when I see a cute pose. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6936.2s)]
*  And then, you know, like just random, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6940.48s)]
*  like facial expressions. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6944.2s)]
*  Look, you can do this too, right? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6946.839999999999s)]
*  Are you posing or are you? [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6949.12s)]
*  No, these are, I'm sure it's from like an album, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6950.36s)]
*  this is my friend. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6952.839999999999s)]
*  Oh wow, yeah. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6955.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6956.2s)]
*  That man is gorgeous. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6957.04s)]
*  Yeah, but he's not posing for the camera. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6957.879999999999s)]
*  He's just fixing his button. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6960.4s)]
*  So to give yourself something to do, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6963.36s)]
*  like fixing the, you know, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6965.5199999999995s)]
*  he's fixing the, what do you call it? [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6967.68s)]
*  The cuff. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6971.64s)]
*  The cuff, yeah. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6973.4800000000005s)]
*  And he's not. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6975.04s)]
*  I love fixing my cuff links as well, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6975.88s)]
*  while staring longingly into the distance. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6977.4400000000005s)]
*  But this will look less fake. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6979.72s)]
*  Well, this is for us. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6982.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6983.4800000000005s)]
*  She's throwing heaters our way right now. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6984.320000000001s)]
*  Fix my cuff links. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6986.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, fix your cuff links, fix your hair, [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6987.68s)]
*  touch your face. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6990.320000000001s)]
*  Show the chrome, show the chrome. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6992.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6993.92s)]
*  But it's like that. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6995.72s)]
*  So icy, so icy entertainment. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=6997.72s)]
*  But that's good. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7001.4400000000005s)]
*  Let me see, do you have a favorite? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7003.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7007.64s)]
*  What time is rockabilly at? [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7010.84s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7013.4800000000005s)]
*  What time do they dance? [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7015.96s)]
*  Like every, every. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7020.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's a good one. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7023.92s)]
*  Well, that's another one you must learn. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7025.4s)]
*  The shoulders. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7028.36s)]
*  The shoulders. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7029.2s)]
*  So good. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7030.04s)]
*  But it's not just the shoulder, [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7031.36s)]
*  she's doing the head tilt. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7032.88s)]
*  Yeah, so in this case, this hand works because. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7035.04s)]
*  See, that's why I always try to do that hand, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7038.92s)]
*  but I'm now learning that. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7041.16s)]
*  I'm learning that it's an aggressive hand. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7043.32s)]
*  Yeah, because of the angle. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7045.88s)]
*  So if you're doing, what she's doing is [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7047.84s)]
*  she's like touching her thigh. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7050.76s)]
*  It's like a dance pose almost. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7052.88s)]
*  And then what you're doing is like. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7055.84s)]
*  Gripping. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7058.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, gripping. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7059.08s)]
*  It's like a grip. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7059.92s)]
*  Oh. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7061.280000000001s)]
*  So hers is like an artist. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7062.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7066.08s)]
*  Yeah, she's like. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7066.92s)]
*  See, she always has a spine. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7068.56s)]
*  That's cute, oh, interesting. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7070.8s)]
*  But yeah, this is typically dangerous for an amateur to avoid. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7073.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, she's a dancer, and I'll say, this is cute. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7078.4400000000005s)]
*  This would be cute here. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7082.2s)]
*  How are we gonna get denim and show up there [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7083.72s)]
*  in the next hour? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7085.5599999999995s)]
*  That's cute as well. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7086.4s)]
*  Yeah, and then this is what I'd like you to do. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7088.44s)]
*  We can do it, we can do it. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7090.88s)]
*  So she has that full like. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7091.72s)]
*  I'll do it. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7093.04s)]
*  You know. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7093.88s)]
*  Look. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7094.72s)]
*  Yeah, she's amazing. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7095.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, she just has so many. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7099.0s)]
*  Yeah, these are beautiful too. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7104.12s)]
*  Yeah, but it's always good to have that. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7106.36s)]
*  Can I give you my take on Caroline? [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7109.5599999999995s)]
*  I think she's one of the most beautiful people [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7111.759999999999s)]
*  I've ever known. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7113.36s)]
*  And I think the reason she doesn't like her photos [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7114.639999999999s)]
*  is because she gets very insecure when she's taking photos. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7117.759999999999s)]
*  Doesn't remember how pretty she is, [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7121.12s)]
*  and then she'll do too much with her face like. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7122.679999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7126.799999999999s)]
*  No, I'm telling you. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7127.639999999999s)]
*  Like watch, take a picture of her right now. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7129.4s)]
*  Put the pressure on her. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7131.12s)]
*  Do it, do it. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7131.96s)]
*  She's taking a photo. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7132.799999999999s)]
*  Do it. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7133.639999999999s)]
*  Be pretty. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7134.48s)]
*  Do her face. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7135.32s)]
*  She's doing way too much. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7136.16s)]
*  Stop. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7137.0s)]
*  See how stretchy. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7137.839999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, it would be weird to have like [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7138.88s)]
*  hanging out with three boys. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7141.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7142.4400000000005s)]
*  Leave me out of this. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7143.28s)]
*  But she's mature. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7145.52s)]
*  I could tell she's having it with us. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7146.56s)]
*  That's why I have to give them shit though. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7148.36s)]
*  See? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7150.6s)]
*  She puts us in our place. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7152.08s)]
*  She's very mean. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7153.2s)]
*  This comes, this goes all the way back [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7156.0s)]
*  to the early club days. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7157.4800000000005s)]
*  When they used to run the front of clubs [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7159.04s)]
*  and they would be trying to get in and stuff. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7161.68s)]
*  Yeah, we put ourselves down [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7164.2s)]
*  because otherwise she beats us. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7165.4800000000005s)]
*  That is true. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7167.8s)]
*  Yeah, so I literally just take voice. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7169.68s)]
*  She can do the same thing, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7173.2s)]
*  but you could just take photos [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7174.32s)]
*  whenever you see a nice poster [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7176.44s)]
*  or in a magazine. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7178.68s)]
*  And then you just try to copy that pose [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7181.44s)]
*  and keep like a big folder of a Pinterest [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7184.4s)]
*  of what you want to do for the photo shoot. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7187.84s)]
*  And this, like we never know like [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7190.16s)]
*  why is this picture looking like, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7192.72s)]
*  looking so nice and natural. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7196.76s)]
*  But we like the vibe it gives us. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7200.08s)]
*  So then all you have to do is copy this [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7203.4400000000005s)]
*  when you're doing the next photo shoot. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7206.360000000001s)]
*  Because you want to evoke, [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7209.360000000001s)]
*  you want to have the person feel things [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7212.04s)]
*  when they see you. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7217.0s)]
*  Right, in a two dimension world. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7219.52s)]
*  What are you feeling? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7222.400000000001s)]
*  Um, hmm, what am I feeling? [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7225.96s)]
*  I think it's cool to watch you kind of like [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7231.0s)]
*  settle into your own look. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7233.4400000000005s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7235.16s)]
*  So with you, I guess, I mean, I know what he's saying. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7241.400000000001s)]
*  So when you're next taking a photo, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7244.360000000001s)]
*  I would challenge you to do what exactly you wouldn't do. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7246.76s)]
*  Like what you would do, don't do the opposite. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7251.400000000001s)]
*  Do the opposite. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7253.88s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7254.8s)]
*  Okay. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7255.64s)]
*  So if Will wants to take a photo of you, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7256.4800000000005s)]
*  what would be something you would typically do? [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7260.64s)]
*  Whatever weird thing with my face. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7265.2s)]
*  No, it's not a weird thing. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7268.320000000001s)]
*  You just look stressed. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7269.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, so I guess I look stressed. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7272.72s)]
*  Okay, so then I would do a pillow fight with you. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7274.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7277.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7278.400000000001s)]
*  Then this would be like a much more fun. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7279.320000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7282.360000000001s)]
*  Like, like, like, like, or like if the tendency, [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7283.2s)]
*  because you seem pretty, like you're, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7287.4s)]
*  everything's really proper. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7290.92s)]
*  So I would go to relax a bit. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7293.679999999999s)]
*  So you look relaxed. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7297.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7298.639999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7313.36s)]
*  I think that's so much, so much cuter [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7314.28s)]
*  to add to the otherwise really proper. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7318.28s)]
*  Okay. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7322.5199999999995s)]

*  My look is very like, it's giving pantsuit. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7330.0s)]
*  It's giving what? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nJECCNz8g&t=7333.44s)]
