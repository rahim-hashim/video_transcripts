**HasanAbi:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM)
*  Donald Trump, if left to his own devices, would unironically do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=0.0s)]
*  Islamic caliphate shit, not Hezbollah, but shit, right? But [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=4.68s)]
*  because he's, you know, doing it in doing it Christian style, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=8.84s)]
*  you consider that to be good and based. It's ridiculous. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=13.52s)]
*  This week, President Trump nominated Dr. Neil Jacobs and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  atmospheric scientist. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=24.32s)]
*  Yeah, the funniest part about this is that you get fired from [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Jiffy Lube for saying 30% less with an earshot of a customer. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=28.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? That's crazy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=33.68s)]
*  To lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=35.6s)]
*  better known as NOAA. In Trump's first term, Jacobs was the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  agency's acting leader during what turned into a political [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  storm. Jacobs was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=45.64s)]
*  I'm eating ono Hawaiian barbecue grilled chicken. I got 16 ounces [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=47.56s)]
*  of straight white grilled chicken breast and I got who asked [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  buddy. Oh my gosh, so many f**king charters. I wanted to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=57.04s)]
*  switch it up and get some grilled chicken teriyaki this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=60.0s)]
*  time. Not Middle Eastern style. Yeah, but who cooked it? I don't [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=62.56s)]
*  know some dude that works at ono Hawaiian barbecue. I don't know [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=65.56s)]
*  what this new sauce they sent me with it. Did you get the katsu [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=68.32s)]
*  sauce? Is fire? I don't know. Little bro don't know the meme. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=70.68s)]
*  Is reprimanded for ethics violations during what became [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  known as Sharpie Gate. National Environmental Correspondent [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  David Schechter investigates what can happen when an [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=81.56s)]
*  administration politicizes science. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=84.52s)]
*  What is important about a hurricane warning? People's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=88.44s)]
*  lives are on the line. In September of 2019, during [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=91.84s)]
*  President Donald Trump's first term, Craig McClain was the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=95.32s)]
*  acting chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Administration or NOAA. It runs the National Weather Service, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=102.36s)]
*  which issues hurricane warnings. Dorian has been pummeling the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=106.12s)]
*  Bahamas for a day and a half on a Sunday, the Weather Service [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=109.44s)]
*  forecasted the storm to move up the Atlantic coast. President [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=112.84s)]
*  Trump tweeted that Alabama was in the storm's path, but it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  wasn't. 20 minutes later, the National Weather Service in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Alabama accurately tweeted Alabama will not see any impacts [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=123.0s)]
*  from Dorian. That contradicted the president. By Wednesday, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  with Dorian still approaching, Trump held up a seven day old [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=131.56s)]
*  map altered with a black marker, making it look like Alabama was [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=134.96s)]
*  in the hurricanes path. The controversy became known as [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=139.24s)]
*  Sharpie Gate. That was the original chart and you see it was [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=142.52s)]
*  going to hit not only Florida, but Georgia could have was going [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=147.36s)]
*  toward the Gulf. By Friday, without McClain's knowledge, the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  leadership at NOAA released a statement backing Trump and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  criticizing the work of the weather forecasters. To have a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  political process, unplug the public's trust, that got me [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=162.24s)]
*  stirred. That gave me a sense of rage. McClain demanded [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=167.76s)]
*  investigations. They concluded that the statement was driven by [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  external political pressure through a request from the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=177.28s)]
*  White House then acting chief of staff and that Neil Jacobs, the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  head of NOAA, who's been nominated again, violated NOAA's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=183.92s)]
*  scientific integrity policy. McClain requested NOAA's top [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  leaders acknowledge the investigative findings. Shortly [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=191.48s)]
*  after, he was relieved of his position. Jacobs has not [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=195.48s)]
*  responded to our request for a comment and a spokesperson for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=198.72s)]
*  NOAA says it does not comment on NOAA. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  This is the most annoying monarch shit. This is stuff that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  you hear about in fictional works that try to recreate what [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  it was like when we had kings, you know what I mean? It's so [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=212.16s)]
*  stupid. Hassan, I've heard you say I do not have an issue with [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah. Do you still stand by this? In terms of their actions [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=218.16s)]
*  against resisting Israel doing a shit side? Yes, I don't. It's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=221.8s)]
*  so funny, because so many of the chatters that come in here and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  say stuff like that literally love Donald Trump. Donald Trump, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=229.68s)]
*  if left to his own devices, would unironically do Islamic [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=233.4s)]
*  caliphate shit, not Hezbollah, but asses shit, right? But [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=237.8s)]
*  because he's, you know, doing it in doing it Christian style, you [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=241.28s)]
*  consider that to be good and based. It's ridiculous. Like, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  what's going on? What's happening? Christian style? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  What you think? Christian Sharia is fake? Or is it because you [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=253.72s)]
*  agree with it? So you don't actually think it's like bad? You [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  advocate for it when your favorite politician is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=262.36s)]
*  advocating for it? Yeah, anyone who's spent enough time in here [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  knows I'm not an advocate for any sort of religious [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  fundamentalism, whether it be Islamic, or Christian, or Jewish. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=271.12s)]
*  I support anyone that'll give me fiber internet. Okay, well, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=275.52s)]
*  boy, do I got to tell you some about Hezbollah. They have fiber [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=278.0s)]
*  internet, there is a 98.8% chance that chatter understood [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=281.24s)]
*  0% of your answer. Okay, probably fair. But it's not [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=285.88s)]
*  necessarily for that chatter alone. I'm sure there's other [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=289.68s)]
*  people who are confused by my approach to certain foreign [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=292.04s)]
*  policy decisions. These chatters want you to say I don't support [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=297.8s)]
*  their harm to civilians. If there's obvious and in good [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=300.68s)]
*  faith. Yes, noon mail. I know you don't have to fucking go to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=303.44s)]
*  spam it over and over again in the chat. I know combinations [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=308.04s)]
*  this blanket that was given to me by my team. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=312.08s)]
*  McLean stayed on with no way in another position and eventually [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=315.04s)]
*  retired. But big picture Noah's science is about more than [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=318.56s)]
*  hurricane warnings. It underpins how corporations and insurance [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  companies predict the ever growing risks of climate [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  disasters helps farmers choose the best time to plant as weather [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=328.92s)]
*  pattern shift. But project 2025, which has served as a roadmap [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=332.64s)]
*  for the new administration calls on Trump to break up Noah [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=337.0s)]
*  accusing it of being one of the main drivers of the climate [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=340.32s)]
*  change alarm industry. We reached out to the Trump White [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=343.48s)]
*  House, but it did not respond to our questions. And during the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=346.52s)]
*  nomination hearings for Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick to lead [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=349.6s)]
*  the Commerce Department, which oversees Noah, he said he does [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=352.24s)]
*  not support breaking it up. Project 2025 is saying Noah's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=355.28s)]
*  alarmist. Well, we're required by law to give the full [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=358.96s)]
*  picture. And if there's a reason to not be alarmist, what is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=362.4s)]
*  that? What we're seeing is alarming. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=368.56s)]
*  He's like, bro, my job is to raise the alarm. That's what I [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=372.96s)]
*  need to do. It is literally my job to raise the alarm when [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  there is climate catastrophe happening. What do you mean [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump's and Republicans anti science approach is so [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=389.44s)]
*  psychotic. And it's going to cook this country literally. I [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=394.36s)]
*  do not understand how you can approach this like they did with [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=399.24s)]
*  COVID where they're like, yeah, if you don't test people, then [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=403.4s)]
*  you just get less cases of COVID. You like you can't do [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=408.32s)]
*  that with COVID anyway. But you definitely can't do that with [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  tornadoes. What are we doing? COVID, at the very least is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=415.24s)]
*  somewhat invisible. Its impact is real. But it's like, you [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=419.56s)]
*  know, germs, people don't understand a tornado is very much [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=424.8s)]
*  visible when it your house at a certain point, someone's gonna [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=428.52s)]
*  be like, why didn't the National Weather Service warn me that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=431.6s)]
*  there was a goddamn tornado, you can't do the COVID thing to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=434.56s)]
*  tornadoes is very alarming. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=437.68s)]
*  McLean says we should all be alarmed by any threats to the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  integrity of the science that supports what we know about our [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  changing climate. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlXNZsaKMM&t=446.84000000000003s)]
