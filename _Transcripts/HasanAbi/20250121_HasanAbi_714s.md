# President Trump Issues Pardons For Jan. 6 Defendants | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs)
*  Since these people have been partying, can they own not great question? As a matter of fact, yes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=0.0s)]
*  The answer is yes. I believe that it depends on the severity of their crimes, but I'm [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=5.36s)]
*  fairly certain that they also get a record expunged too. So I think they will be able to own. Yes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=10.08s)]
*  But also this is America. Damn it. Since when? Since when has that stopped a person? Come on now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=18.0s)]
*  Okay. Trump not confident. This is Hamasi's fire will hold. He said, but I gotta go pee, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=30.0s)]
*  but we'll talk about president Trump issuing pardons for the January 6th defendants. Now [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=36.96s)]
*  who's from president Trump on his very first day back in office round two, his inaugural speech [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=42.0s)]
*  promises start of what he called a golden age in America. The president signed a record number of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  executive actions to do with everything from energy to immigration, to Americans, gender identity. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=52.24s)]
*  Trump also issued blanket pardons or commutations for those who attacked the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=58.08s)]
*  That means even the people convicted of organizing a plot to overthrow the U S government are set to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=64.8s)]
*  go free. Scott McFarland starts our team coverage from Capitol Hill. Scott, good morning. Some of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  this seemed to take even the president's allies by surprise. Yeah, Nate, that's because the pardoned [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=74.24s)]
*  include those who committed violent acts on January 6th, including those who gassed clubbed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=79.84s)]
*  and maimed police officers and those who stole and destroyed property here at the Capitol. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=85.28s)]
*  Supporters of January 6th inmates celebrated outside of DC jail. So this is January 6th. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=94.08s)]
*  After president Trump's side, broad pardons and commutations for the defendants who attacked the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Capitol and sought to overturn the 2020 election and ordered federal penitentiaries to release [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=105.28s)]
*  hundreds of defendants still in prison by Tuesday, contrary to what Trump's own vice president [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=111.68s)]
*  thought was possible. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=117.12s)]
*  Trump championed his decision at a rally before signing the order, referring to January 6th rioters [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=121.92s)]
*  as hostages, even while standing beside the families of Israeli hostages. We'll be signing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  pardons for a lot of people, a lot of people. When pressed in the Oval Office about why he'd [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=133.84s)]
*  pardon the 600 plus defendants charged with assaulting police, Trump made baseless claims [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=140.32s)]
*  the FBI was involved in instigating the attack. There were outside agitators involved and obviously [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  the FBI was involved. Far-right group leaders Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys and Stuart [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=151.76s)]
*  Rhodes of the Oath Keepers who were convicted of seditious conspiracy and plotting the attack [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=157.04s)]
*  are among those receiving clemency. Donald Trump has determined that those individuals [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  should not face any accountability solely because they committed those acts on his behalf. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=170.32s)]
*  Michael Fanon, a former DC police officer, was attacked at the Capitol. I can assure you that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=178.0s)]
*  these individuals will go on to commit acts of violence, maybe even commit acts of violence [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=182.88s)]
*  against me or members of my family. The American people own this decision. Pam Hemphill, an Idaho [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=189.12s)]
*  grandmother, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for her participation on January 6th. I already had [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=198.16s)]
*  decided I will not take a pardon from Trump. That would give the wrong message. I'm not going to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=203.12s)]
*  rewrite their story for them. That day we were guilty. I pleaded guilty because I was guilty [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=208.16s)]
*  and so are they. Damn. The large... What the f*** the criminal justice system works? What's happening? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=214.4s)]
*  What the hell is that? Since these people have been pardoned, can they... Great question. As a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=220.72s)]
*  matter of fact, yes. The answer is yes. I believe that it depends on the severity of their crimes, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=225.76s)]
*  but I'm fairly certain that they also get a record expunged too. So I think they will be able to own [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=232.32s)]
*  the f*** yes. But also this is America, god damn it. Since when? Since when has that stopped a person? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=239.44s)]
*  Come on now. That's only a serious legal... That's only a thing that has serious legal repercussions. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  If you're the president's son and you happen to lie on your gun forms when you were purchasing a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=254.4s)]
*  revolver where you said, oh, I wasn't under the influence of drugs. And then stupid enough to write [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=260.8s)]
*  about it in a book where you were like, I was on so much crack when I bought this gun illegally and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=265.92s)]
*  lied on my legal forms about not being on crack. I love doing crack cocaine. Here are multiple photos [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=270.24s)]
*  of me on my laptop of me doing crack cocaine while also holding the gun I illegally purchased. I am [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=275.68s)]
*  just going to leave my laptop in the hands of a blind computer repair person and never pick it up. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=282.64s)]
*  All of that sounds insane, but that's exactly what happened with Hunter Biden. Wow. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=290.56s)]
*  ...just criminal prosecution in US history is abruptly over with the stroke of a magic marker. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=295.84s)]
*  Not only will the jails be emptied of January 6th defendants, but all pending prosecutions have been [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=301.68s)]
*  ordered to be... Wait, he actually left it with him? I thought it was hack material? No, I did too [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  because I was like, what? A blind laptop repair person who was also a QAnon guy? That sounds insane. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=311.52s)]
*  This must be hacked material. Okay. That's what I thought too. No, lo and behold, turns out that's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  actually what happened. He literally so stupid that he left his laptop with a blind laptop repair [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  person and never picked it up. And it also happened to be that the blind laptop repair person was a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  right-wing psycho. Yes, he left. He left the laptop and full and off to California. He flew back to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=339.2s)]
*  Los Angeles. There's actually news on the January 6th is buying QAnon. Shaman says he's buying [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=347.84s)]
*  after Trump pardon. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. This guy's awesome. It's funny how much this rant [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  sounds exactly how dumb Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death was. Oh, you mean to tell me that the 86 year old [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=361.68s)]
*  Supreme Court justice that under the Barack Obama administration could have been replaced [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=368.48s)]
*  because she had had cancer four times and then had cancer six additional times since then, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=373.6s)]
*  mysteriously died under weird circumstances a week after she actually officiated a wedding during [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=379.36s)]
*  COVID? How could this have happened? How? Who could have foreseen this? Are you kidding me? Dude, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=386.16s)]
*  this is why I always tell you it's not like the Republicans are brilliant tacticians. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=395.12s)]
*  They're not. They're f**k ups. They're losers. They're dumbasses. But they're dumbasses who at [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=400.8s)]
*  least have the integrity to want to win. To want to win to do bad things, but they still want to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=407.92s)]
*  win nonetheless. The Democrats, on the other hand, are the biggest f**king losers on the planet. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=414.88s)]
*  So of course, they just keep losing to the dumbest, racist morons over and over and over [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=420.88s)]
*  and over again, over and over and over and over again. It's not the Republicans that are really [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=430.64s)]
*  good at winning, okay? It's that the Republicans are really good at losing. They love losing. They [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=435.84s)]
*  f**king love it. It's their favorite f**king thing. And here we are. Here we are. Now you got the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=440.96s)]
*  QAnon Shaman buying guns and God, you know what? F**k it. Oh, did I say I meant Democrats? Yes, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=448.48s)]
*  the Democrats love losing. They are big fans of losing, specifically to the Republicans. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=455.04s)]
*  The Democrats love losing to Republicans, okay? If the Democratic Party had a fraction of the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  intensity and competence that they display with regular frequency when it comes to destroying [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=467.12s)]
*  any sort of like anti-capitalist sentiment amongst their own ranks, if they could take [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=472.88s)]
*  a fraction of that energy and apply it to defeating Republicans, we would be regime-pilled. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=479.76s)]
*  Okay? This would be FDR year over year if they, well, ironically enough, if there was the last [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=485.68s)]
*  time they actually did do that, but that's besides the point. Okay? Never again. Oh, God forbid. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you believe America's reached peak stupidity yet? I mean, we are past the point of peak [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=498.0s)]
*  stupidity, I think. Closed. Effective immediately. I mean, I just looked at an article titled QAnon [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=502.32s)]
*  Shaman says he's buying motherf**king guns after Trump pardoned. And you asked me the question, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=510.32s)]
*  are we at peak stupidity? What do you think? I mean, American politics is an endless well [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=516.96s)]
*  of depravity. So this is not the peak, I don't think. I'll be honest. It's probably not the peak. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=521.92s)]
*  It's probably going to get worse. Yeah. This was Kush bombs best, one of his best takes in a sea [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=528.32s)]
*  of incredible takes on January 20th, 2017. He said, this is the stupidest day in American history, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=534.6400000000001s)]
*  a record that will be broken by every subsequent day in American history. Okay. He said no longer [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=540.6400000000001s)]
*  accurate, bitch. He said, just wait today. Wasn't that dumb? That's a mirror until we have, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=546.6400000000001s)]
*  look, I think we are going to consistently devolve. Okay. We are going to rip the remainder [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=554.72s)]
*  of the carcass of public education in this country into shreds. All right. And ultimately, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=561.04s)]
*  we'll get to a point where the only people who can actually win enough popular support have to be [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=568.72s)]
*  car crash victims. Okay. I'm talking like John Fetterman is going to come across like a road [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=575.52s)]
*  scholar. Like if you want to be able to win elections, you have to straight up be walking [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=581.04s)]
*  in the walls and shit. So people can be like, well, that guy, he just like me. Okay. Like that is the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=588.8s)]
*  level that we have to get to. And then one of those car crash victims accidentally launches all the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=594.56s)]
*  nukes. Okay. But because machine politics and because capitalism is a, is a very well oiled [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  machine that is constantly eating away at itself, but also constantly, seemingly creating like [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  ways, stays of execution basically over and over and over again. At that point, it's just completely [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=611.28s)]
*  automated. Okay. Policymaking is completely automated, except they'll have like a situation [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=616.9599999999999s)]
*  where they accidentally forgot to lock away the nukes or, or, you know, put the child lock on the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=622.8s)]
*  nukes or something. Raytheon Lockheed Martin, the Raytheon Lockheed Martin sponsored White House [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=628.16s)]
*  room that is covered in rugs. Okay. All the walls are covered in rugs because you don't want your [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=638.16s)]
*  president to fucking walk into too many walls and die, right. Or sharp objects, but they accidentally [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=645.52s)]
*  forgot to put the child lock back on. Okay. And then whoever the car crash victim president is, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=651.12s)]
*  depend, it doesn't matter which fucking party he's a part of, ends up accidentally hitting the nuke. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=656.88s)]
*  And then we're all dead. These nukes were sponsored by DraftKings. These nukes were sponsored by [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=661.28s)]
*  DraftKings OnlyFans. The conglomerate, the conglomerate vice factory for all your entertainment [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=666.16s)]
*  needs. That's what would happen is the nuke fucking as the mushroom cloud comes up. While the nukes [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=673.04s)]
*  are exploding, Polymarket would have a ticker on it too. It's like a likelihood that the nukes will [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=679.12s)]
*  kill 75% of the planet. People will still be fucking betting their Trump coins and, and other [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=683.6s)]
*  meme coins on the Polymarket betting app. Is DraftKings OnlyFans merger on your bingo car for 2025? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  Nah, probably around like 2028. We're not there yet. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=694.8s)]
*  By the way, pro Israel group are infighting according to Jewish insider. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7tKC6stFs&t=705.92s)]
