# Who Won The VP Debate? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4)
*  I don't know what Tim waltz is real opinions are, but it's obvious to me that that's not something [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=0.0s)]
*  that he is like fully on board with. He's having a hard time or even if he is fully on board with it, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=4.96s)]
*  he's having a hard time communicating that. Okay. JD Vance immediately jumped on and gave a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=10.08s)]
*  summarization of the hillbilly elegy because he understood that like this is his opportunity [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=17.68s)]
*  to basically describe his background to as broad of an audience as possible. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=21.6s)]
*  Governor Tim waltz and Ohio senator JD Vance taking the stage at the sole vice presidential [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=30.56s)]
*  debate hosted by CBS with a so right off the jump. I have a lot of thoughts on the debate. Okay. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=36.56s)]
*  Many people, many people want to hear what my like immediate approach was or what my overall [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=44.88s)]
*  understanding of the debate was. Okay. And it was soul sucking. It was I hated it. Okay. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=51.04s)]
*  I hated it for a bunch of different reasons. Number one, it ended up presenting JD Vance [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=58.0s)]
*  like a normal human being, which is really up. Okay. You ran an ad 10 minutes ago, loser. Okay. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=64.24s)]
*  Just, you know, let's, let's, let's get people to shut up a little bit. I'm just going to ban [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=70.4s)]
*  a bunch of people today. I think I'm in a bad fucking mood. It made JD Vance look moderate. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=76.8s)]
*  JD Vance came on that stage with one goal and one goal only. It wasn't even like defend Trump [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=83.04s)]
*  that much. Obviously he still has to do that. Cause like, you know, he has an audience of one, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  but, but his major goal tonight was, or last night was to basically present himself as like [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  a moderate person, a solid communicator that has a liberal veneer on some very illiberal and very, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=99.04s)]
*  very right-wing ideologies. And he did a good job at that. I hate to recognize that. I think that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=108.08s)]
*  is devastating. I think that is a bad thing, but I do think he did a pretty solid job and his [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=114.72s)]
*  approval rating post debate went up as a consequence of that. It was also very frustrating [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=120.16s)]
*  because Tim Walz is a normal guy. He is not this like machine politician overall. And because of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=126.0s)]
*  that, he's kind of, he's kind of weak when it comes to defending certain machine politician [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=134.0s)]
*  requirements. And the debate starting off with, would you allow Israel to first strike Iran? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=140.64s)]
*  Definitely knocked the wind out of his sails. Okay. It did. It started off real rough because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=148.64s)]
*  I don't think like I'm not being parasocial or anything. Like, do I think that Tim Walz is like [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=156.08s)]
*  someone who is invested in the continuation of the Israeli, the Palestinian population? Yes. Okay. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=162.24s)]
*  I do. I don't think he cares, but I also personally think that his heart is not in the same way [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=168.16s)]
*  that like other politicians may be, you know, get a guy like Brian Mast up there to talk about it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=176.32s)]
*  He'll chirp till the cows come home about how awesome it is that Palestinian children need to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=182.48s)]
*  be melted. Right? He is not necessarily the guy who is all that invested. And you saw it. You saw [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=187.04s)]
*  it because there were issues that he was genuinely invested in and he popped off when talking about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=194.48s)]
*  it. So the first half definitely went to JD Vance on that front because a lot of these questions [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=199.68s)]
*  and a lot of these issues, okay, a lot of these issues were issues that machine politicians are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  equipped to talk about. Right? JD Vance is a very cunning, wily little rat in a human suit. Okay. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=215.6s)]
*  He's a lizard person in a human suit. He can communicate with podcasts. There is about incel [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=224.48s)]
*  griper, but he can also shift his, you know, he can shift his language to an audience that is [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=229.84s)]
*  predominantly liberal. He can moderate himself. Right? That's just the truth. He is like Pete [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=237.44s)]
*  Buttigieg, but Pete Buttigieg has, I would say more charisma even than JD Vance. Now overall, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=242.8s)]
*  overall, I was frustrated with the way in which Tim Walz announced himself to the most prominent, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  to the largest possible platform he could have announced himself to. What do I mean by this? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=260.16s)]
*  This is the biggest, this is the biggest audience he's going to be in front of. Okay. I wished that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=265.36s)]
*  he would have been able to communicate his desires and communicate his opinions [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  in the same exact ways that he was able to do so when talking about lowering pharma prices, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=276.24s)]
*  lowering housing costs. Like you saw how passionate he would get on issues that he cares [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=281.6s)]
*  about. Healthcare is another one. He's very good on those issues. I hated how much they agreed [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=286.96s)]
*  though, because Tim Walz is like a normal guy. Okay. He's a yokel. That is his appeal. And as a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=292.64s)]
*  yokel normal guy and not like a, you know, real politician in the way that you understand it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=299.2s)]
*  Okay. He's not going to come across as solid on American foreign policy. And he's, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=306.8s)]
*  he definitely did not come across as solid on immigration. I would say that the reason for why [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=313.76s)]
*  this was a 50 50 deadlock in most of the polls that came out afterwards with some independence [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=320.96s)]
*  favoring Tim Walz over JD Vance is because of the platform that these two parties represent, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=326.96s)]
*  not on immigration specifically, but on, on how hard JD Vance goes on immigration, how hard the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=333.12s)]
*  right-wing platform goes on immigration and, and how normal Tim Walz can present himself to a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  broader audience in comparison to JD Vance, who was very good at, you know, masquerading as like [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  a moderate if he wants to, but he still has this like nervous energy to why is disgusted by. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=354.4s)]
*  So Tim Walz standing next to him and agree. Do I mean by this? JD Vance is an unlikable psychopath. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=360.56s)]
*  So when you got a likable yokel like Tim Walz being like, I agree with you, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  behaving like a kindergarten teacher. Okay. And JD Vance is like the bad behaving child or whatever. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=373.84s)]
*  You're going to make him look good. And that's precisely what happened. He had more to gain [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=380.0s)]
*  than Tim Walz did in this situation. Okay. But yeah, right off the jump, the first question was [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=384.24s)]
*  whether either vice president would allow Israel to first strike Iran. We are a ridiculous nation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay. That was my initial assessment. Okay. It was very frustrating to watch that. Like [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=397.6s)]
*  Israel is doing South Africa speed runs right now. Okay. Like opening up new fronts. They're [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=404.88s)]
*  an apartheid on a good day. They're doing on a bad day every day. And on top of that, they're like [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=411.36s)]
*  busy opening up multiple fronts. And the first question is like America's not reigning Israel in [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=417.76s)]
*  at all. The media analysis is will you let Israel unfold? Will you let Israel create a nuclear [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=424.72s)]
*  Holocaust? That's crazy. That's a crazy way to interpret the events that are unfolding [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=432.0s)]
*  in front of our eyes. So I knew that there was going to be a uniparty assessment there. But [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=439.04s)]
*  overall, overall, like, I don't know what Tim Walz's real opinions are, but it's obvious to me that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=446.8s)]
*  that's not something that he is like fully on board with. He's having a hard time, or even if he is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=453.44s)]
*  fully on board with it, he's having a hard time communicating that. Okay. JD Vance immediately [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=458.32000000000005s)]
*  jumped on and gave a summarization of the hillbilly elegy because he understood that like this is his [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=465.28s)]
*  opportunity to basically describe his background to as broad of an audience as possible, even though [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  everybody hates them. Okay. And the worst aspect of it early on, and this is like something I locked [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=475.52s)]
*  into pretty quickly, was that JD Vance also did a much better job than Trump when it comes to lying [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=482.32s)]
*  about bringing into global conflict. Okay. Like, I often talk about 2016 era Trump, how he was able [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=489.68s)]
*  to successfully present himself as a peaceful dove, right? Against Hillary Clinton's war mongering [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=500.16s)]
*  tendencies. 2024 Trump, on the other hand, hasn't done that well. He has definitely lost his step a [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=505.12s)]
*  little bit. JD Vance on the other hand, in my opinion, did a better job of communicating not [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=511.36s)]
*  just on this front, but on a lot of the key Republican conversations. And the media reception [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=518.0s)]
*  on that, with the exception of January 6th, was showcasing exactly what I'm saying. Okay. Like JD [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=524.0s)]
*  Vance was able to communicate Trump's insane policies, whether it be on immigration or [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=533.04s)]
*  beyond Trump's insane policies on immigration, like the hard things to talk about, like abortion, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=543.76s)]
*  he is able to moderate that even better. He's like, oh, we got to do better with women. Like, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=550.08s)]
*  we got to do better at listening to women. Like, he is such a classic former liberal that he knows [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=555.04s)]
*  exactly how to tap into that. And I think that played well to at least the media class. Okay. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  And he has a lot more experience in this field, both as like a Yale guy and also as a guy who was [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=570.72s)]
*  a liberal. He was a liberal. He was liberal until not that long ago. But yeah, another aspect of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=576.24s)]
*  this also is that it's wild that Tim Walz's entire shtick, I said, is that he's a normal, not a real [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=582.48s)]
*  politician kind of guy. His answer about defending the apartheid regime start to write to start world [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=588.4000000000001s)]
*  three is textbook soulless, a moral politician. And he's not going to be good at that. He's just [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  going to be good at that. He's just not, he can't do that. And the other thing that I had called out [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=598.08s)]
*  ahead of time, ahead of the debate was that he was always going to be, he was always going to be, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=603.68s)]
*  and Tim Walz is who I'm talking about here. He was always going to be on crutches. You know, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=609.44s)]
*  he was always going to have training weights on because he was always going to have training [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=615.04s)]
*  weights on because he has to defend Kamala Harris's policy because she's leading the ticket. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=620.16s)]
*  Okay, that's it. And when you have those training ways on and you're sitting there defending, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=626.72s)]
*  you know, the right wing border bill, you, if you don't have your own way of communicating that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=634.4s)]
*  right wing border bill, then you're going to have to use their talking points. And that's why it was [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=641.36s)]
*  Kamala bought 2.0. He literally kept repeating the same exact lines. That's bad coaching. Okay. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=646.4s)]
*  That's bad coaching. That's just straight up. Like they know what kind of, they know what kind [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=654.88s)]
*  of potential they have with Tim Walz. That's why they chose them. Right. So why are you telling [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=660.64s)]
*  him to just reiterate Kamala Harris's position that she keeps repeating over and over again? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=665.52s)]
*  It's very bad. It was very bad rhetoric. Okay. He literally said she prosecuted transnational gangs. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=671.12s)]
*  Like you don't have to use her points, dude. You don't have to use her talking points. Be [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=678.48s)]
*  yourself anyway. JD Vance said 1 million undocumented immigrants have committed some [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=683.36s)]
*  kind of on us soil as he walks through how he'd deport 25 million migrants. It was very frustrating. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=688.72s)]
*  Obviously he was able to once again, repeat his positions on, on immigrants without coming across [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=695.12s)]
*  as insane as Donald Trump. Okay. That's another area where like JD Vance, in my opinion, did a [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  more professional, like he was, he was able to add a professional veneer to the, the deeply, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=709.44s)]
*  deeply right wing, deeply white nativist immigration, anti-immigrant sentiments. Okay. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=718.24s)]
*  He didn't have like any moments like the ones that you've heard him on those podcasts about like [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=725.28s)]
*  coming across as weird about like having a breeding fetish for women. Okay. Treating women as like, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=731.76s)]
*  you know, cows basically, or saying that like he's lying about immigrant stories [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=737.04s)]
*  because he wants to hyper-focus on like taking away the TPS status of like Haitian migrants that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=745.28s)]
*  are living on us soil. Like the policies are weird, but he wasn't showcasing it in a weird way. He [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=751.04s)]
*  didn't communicate it in a way where like, I think the, the average onlooker would look at that and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  go, dude, what the like this guy's out of his mind. Donald Trump failed on that front. Okay. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=763.84s)]
*  And part of that, part of the reason why JD Vance was able to successfully communicate this [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  is because Democrats don't address some of the very basic lies that the Republican party tells [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=775.44s)]
*  on a regular basis. They're locked in on a right wing border attitude. They're just completely [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  committed to it. And it's very, very frustrating. It's very frustrating to see that. This is another [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=789.6s)]
*  thing that I've been yelling about for months. Okay. For months and months, I have been screaming [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=796.48s)]
*  since October 4 or October 5, I think before October 7, when Joe Biden came out and unveiled [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=804.64s)]
*  his right wing border bill that he got like an incredibly conservative Republican senator from [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  Oklahoma to write that he was committed to ever since the Democrats rolled out their anti-immigrant [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=819.04s)]
*  proposals. I've been yelling about how you cannot outflank the Republicans on this issue. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=825.12s)]
*  You cannot cave and capitulate and concede to right wing framing on this issue. And they [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=830.7199999999999s)]
*  absolutely have, and they are not going to change trajectory on this. And I despise them for doing [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=836.0799999999999s)]
*  that because even if it actually helped them win the election, then ultimately you're still passing [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=842.0s)]
*  a right wing border bill. Like you're still hurting the future of this country. You're still [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=848.56s)]
*  bouldering towards it. But now with a D sticker slapped onto it, it's completely, patently [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=853.68s)]
*  unacceptable. Okay. But the other side of this is that it also doesn't even help the Democrats. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=859.28s)]
*  I'm losing my mind. The Dems never mentioned that it's U.S. citizens trafficking the drugs [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  across the border. It's literally 80% of the drug apprehensions. And yet that never gets brought up. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=868.8s)]
*  If you ask most Americans, average Americans who are maybe a little bit more thoughtful about the [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=874.4s)]
*  situation, most of them think drug mules, children, JD Vance said children make the best drug mules, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=880.0s)]
*  by the way. Like these people, most people actually legitimately think that it's immigrants that are [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=886.4s)]
*  bringing the drugs into the country. It's just not true. It is incorrect. And it blows my mind [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=894.48s)]
*  that we don't ever discuss the reality of the situation. Okay. Ryan Marino quote tweeted me [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=902.08s)]
*  and said 88% of fentanyl trafficking convictions across the southern border are U.S. citizens. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=907.68s)]
*  0.02% of people crossing illegally possess fentanyl. That's what every single law enforcement [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=912.48s)]
*  agency says. And the data is public. And I can't see how increasing money to the border will help [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=918.32s)]
*  prevent any drug overdose when CBP are the ones smuggling the rest of the drugs into the country. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=923.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's so weird. I mean, it's not like it's I don't think this is incompetence. I don't think [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=927.52s)]
*  this is like negligence. I think it is because the Democrats have also decided they are going to be [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=935.52s)]
*  right wing on the border going forward forever. Like I think that they're just locked in on it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=942.96s)]
*  I think it's on purpose. It's very, very, it's very tough. And I do think it's deliberate. Tim [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=948.0799999999999s)]
*  Waltz is defending a right wing border bill that literally is funding for Trump's border wall in [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=954.8s)]
*  it. I hate this party so much. They're in agreement on the made up issue that migrants constitute a [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  national security threat. Dems just want to be lame about the optics. Yeah. Once again, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=962.24s)]
*  Democrats find themselves in the realm of bad politics and bad policy. It's bad politics [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=966.9599999999999s)]
*  because you can out, you can never outflank the right on, you know, anti-immigrant sentiment [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  because this sentiment is not coming from a logical place. It's coming from pure. That's it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=984.4s)]
*  It's pure white supremacist attitudes, right? So you can't really outflank them by being like, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=989.76s)]
*  well, hold on now. We got to logically do this situation. It's like, it's illogical. It's illogical [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=994.8s)]
*  because immigrants do not constitute a national security threat. They are literally not a burden, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1000.3199999999999s)]
*  but a boon on American economy. And also beyond that, they literally do less. They do less per [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1004.9599999999999s)]
*  capita than natural born US citizens. It's so stupid. So just say the truth. Say the truth. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1010.24s)]
*  It made me that this is something that they've just completely dropped. And there is polling to [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1016.96s)]
*  show that the overall American sentiment, the overarching American sentiment towards migration [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1021.76s)]
*  patterns towards immigrants in general was objectively positive, significantly more positive [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1027.6s)]
*  when the Democrats were actually hammering against Trump's right wing white nativist [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1034.72s)]
*  border bill and border policies. Okay. But they completely dropped that early on. They just went, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1039.12s)]
*  they changed trajectory. They went right wing immediately. The truth is not what that, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1047.12s)]
*  what their target demo voter want to hear. That's not true. Their target demo voters [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  will literally change their minds if they hear the truth from someone. But if no one is saying the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1058.0s)]
*  truth on either side, then yeah, lies are going to lead this conversation. And it's bad politics [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1063.52s)]
*  and it's bad policy because it's like you're going to harm the US economy and you're going to harm a [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1071.04s)]
*  ton of people in the process by implementing or allowing anti-immigrant sentiment to fester. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1076.4s)]
*  That's why we have the bomb threats in Springfield, Ohio, because that's what happens [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1084.4s)]
*  when people do legitimately believe that like undocumented and documented immigrants, like the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1089.04s)]
*  Haitians that have TPS are rapist cat eaters, brother. That's it. What do you think is going [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1093.76s)]
*  to happen? You're going to have pogroms. That's it. It's already happening and Trump's not even [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1099.52s)]
*  president yet. I don't know, man. I think you're a prime example that people don't want to hear [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1103.52s)]
*  the truth. What do you mean? Me saying this is entirely different than the one of the two parties [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  effectively communicating this because when I say it, it doesn't move the needle. When I say it, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1115.76s)]
*  NBC, CNN, ABC is not going to cover it. Okay. But when Kamala Harris says it, they will cover it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1122.24s)]
*  And I think the Democrats expectation is that like the media will make up for that. The media [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1129.04s)]
*  will make up for that misinformation when they won't. They won't do it. Polls say most Americans, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1133.76s)]
*  you had a hundred K people in here only to listen to debate coverage, but you spend every day [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1139.68s)]
*  talking and doing actual work. The general public does not care. Polls say most Americans [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1142.8s)]
*  support mass deportation is good politics to be honest. Yeah. Those very same polls also, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  those very same polls also literally show that Americans also want amnesty. They literally have [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1151.36s)]
*  90% approval rating for giving dreamers American citizenship. How do you make sense of those polls? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't fucking matter. Americans for the most part do not see how bad a policy is until [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1163.68s)]
*  it's in effect. That's why under the Trump administration, when Trump actually was [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1170.88s)]
*  implementing right-wing border policies, Americans were very much against that. Joe Biden ran against [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1175.0400000000002s)]
*  that. Joe Biden was far closer on the issue of immigration to Donald Trump and even beat him on [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1181.2s)]
*  certain polls when he was running against Trump's border policies. They're kidding the centrist voters [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1187.92s)]
*  in swing states. No dumb ass. They're telling you that. Okay. They're telling you that. And you're [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1193.7600000000002s)]
*  just repeating that without critically thinking about the issue. I'm over here trying to explain [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1199.52s)]
*  to you that this is a ridiculous thing, that this is a stupid thing to do. All you're doing [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1203.76s)]
*  is telling your base of voters that undocumented migrants constitute a national security threat. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1210.8s)]
*  When the Democrats say Republicans are right on immigration, that we have to do something about it, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1216.24s)]
*  all they've done is legitimize their perspective. Their perspective is not born out of data. Their [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1222.56s)]
*  perspective is not born out of the truth. All you've done is make your base of support, your voters [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1227.76s)]
*  who trust you, who believe you, believe you when you say, yeah, immigrants do constitute a national [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1235.2s)]
*  security threat. We got to do something about it. That's all you've done. You have made the entirety [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1240.64s)]
*  now of the broader electorate turn right-wing on immigration. That's it. Also, the idea that Democrats [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1245.76s)]
*  listen to polls when it suits their broader purpose is so stupid when it comes to Israel. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1253.68s)]
*  There is overwhelming support for pushing for a ceasefire. There is even overwhelming support [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1261.1200000000001s)]
*  for denying transfers as a way to push Israel to do a ceasefire. Democrats don't listen to that. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1267.52s)]
*  Democrats might lose Michigan for this reason. So obviously, they don't give a fuck about the polls [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1274.0800000000002s)]
*  when it's something that they care about, when it's an issue that they care more about. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  They care more about continuing American foreign policy that is set in stone instead of actually [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1282.88s)]
*  doing something that is electorally beneficial. Dems winning elections, stopping deportation is [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1289.5200000000002s)]
*  good. It's pragmatic. No, it's not. You are just repeating things that you read and things that you [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1293.8400000000001s)]
*  saw on MSNBC without applying any kind of critical thinking to this process whatsoever. You are [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1299.2800000000002s)]
*  literally the living definitional proof that Democrats catering to this right-wing framing [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1306.4s)]
*  ends up making dumbasses like you who are lifelong liberals also repeat the same Republican. You are [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1314.24s)]
*  what I'm talking about. You are also the perfect example. If you were around in 2020, you said [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1320.4s)]

*  policies in terms of the border bills that he pushed for. What changed? What changed? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1339.44s)]
*  The Democrats started also assuming a right-wing attitude on the border. So now you're also assuming [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1345.6000000000001s)]
*  a right-wing attitude. That's it. That's the issue. 100% in Redditor. Yes. Use the page up key on the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1351.52s)]

*  media cycle where people literally end up repeating those talking points as though it's actually a [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1478.16s)]
*  brilliant tactic when it's not, it's just not. And it's funny because Democrats have done this [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1482.96s)]
*  over and over and over again. They've done it on funding the police. Nobody thinks that the Democrats [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1489.04s)]
*  are the fund, the police party. Okay. It's not going to happen, but they do it anyway. Liberals [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1494.08s)]
*  posing like 2016 Republicans. Yeah. At the border was swagger sick, man. Sick. It's very, very, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1498.1599999999999s)]
*  very frustrating to see this. Okay. I started listening to books about socialism. They, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1507.6s)]
*  thanks for teaching me. Oh yeah. Good stuff. Anyway, here, there, there it is. This is the [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1515.04s)]
*  other side of this. Okay. The democratic party did not really fight this trend. That is bad enough. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1519.52s)]
*  More worrying to me is that I do not think it would have mattered if it tried. Public opinion [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1523.68s)]
*  doesn't work that way. I don't agree with this as adding your momentum. Anti-immigrant views went [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1527.68s)]
*  up during the first few years of the Biden's term when crossings were super elevated, but the numbers [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1531.6s)]
*  were right in line with pre-Trump attitudes. It's only been since the Dems surrendered this year that [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1536.08s)]
*  we've seen crazy shifts. Look at that. Look at Americans preference for migration. Americans [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1541.2s)]
*  preferences, preferences for migration, for immigration to the U S thinking now about [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1546.96s)]
*  immigrants. That is people who come from other countries to live here in the United States. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1552.0s)]
*  In your view, should immigration be kept at his present level, increased or decreased? 55% now say [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1554.56s)]
*  decreased, dude. Look at that massive spike on that football right there. Parties are limited. Yes, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1559.68s)]
*  but they aren't powerless. They have the capacity to shape circumstances in which they exist. That's [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1565.2s)]
*  exactly what Democrats have done here. It's not just in the way that anyone should want. There's [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1569.28s)]
*  zero pushback. So what are people supposed to think? Vance even blamed immigrants for smuggling [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1575.28s)]
*  guns in the U S, which is the exact opposite of how the gun trafficking works. And no one said a [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1578.48s)]
*  thing. You can blame everything on immigrants now to complete silence. And the more the Democrats [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1582.16s)]
*  actually give the Republicans ample ground to elevate these, the status, like the danger that [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1586.48s)]
*  immigrants present, the worse things are going to get for immigrants. Okay. It's crazy. What are [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1594.3999999999999s)]
*  people supposed to think if both parties are saying it, if both parties are saying it, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  then it must be true. Why would you think otherwise? And of course the average American [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1605.76s)]
*  that doesn't have the capacity to think for themselves or seek out this data is going to go, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1612.24s)]
*  sorry, I don't trust you. I trust the experts and the experts keep either staying quiet when [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1617.28s)]
*  the anti-border sentiment is expressed by the Republican party or directly contributing to that [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1624.4s)]
*  with right-wing border bills that they are trying to push for. It is very bad if the Democratic [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1630.0s)]
*  party's proposition is Morgan is here. It's very bad if the Democratic party's proposition is, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1636.0s)]
*  we are the going to be the real border protectors. Okay. That's very bad. That's very bad for the [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1643.76s)]
*  future of America because you will never be able to successfully outflank Republicans on patriotism. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1648.4s)]
*  You will never be able to successfully outflank Republicans on militarism. You will never be able [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1653.68s)]
*  to successfully outflank Republicans on and most of this is also still coming from the underlying [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1657.92s)]
*  notion of white supremacist attitudes. Anyway, it's not a logical conclusion that they've arrived at. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1665.28s)]
*  It is born not out of empirical evidence, but instead about born out of pure right-wing mania. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1670.48s)]
*  Okay. And here it is. And you saw that anyway, you saw that distinction for Tim Walz's own [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1676.4s)]
*  performance when he was talking about kitchen table issues like lowering the cost of medication [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1683.44s)]
*  or housing. He's cracked on that. Okay. He was popping off on that dude. While I agree, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1686.64s)]
*  while we agree with your views on immigration, swing state voters in Georgia, PA, Michigan, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1691.2s)]
*  North Carolina, and dude, you're wrong. Okay. You're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. You're [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1694.56s)]
*  just wrong on this issue. Okay. Because if the Democratic party hadn't capitulated the right-wing [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1700.24s)]
*  framing on the matter, they literally would not be in this circumstance to begin with. But beyond [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1706.56s)]
*  that, but beyond that, every single time they capitulate the right-wing framing on the border, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1712.64s)]
*  they are one losing potential voters that are younger, losing potential voters that are Latino, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1719.8400000000001s)]
*  younger Latino voters specifically in key states, not those states that you mentioned, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1727.44s)]
*  but in other states. And beyond that, okay, beyond that, there are plenty of, there are, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1731.92s)]
*  like, whenever you say that, whenever you say that immigrants constitute a national security threat, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1738.96s)]
*  you are simply, to all of those swing state voters, what you're telling them is that Trump is right, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1744.24s)]
*  that we do need to build a border wall. Trump is so right that now Kamala Harris wants to build a [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1750.8s)]
*  border wall. And I kept explaining this to you guys over and over again. Okay. If the Republican [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1755.52s)]
*  party tomorrow came out and said that they're pro-Medicare for all, okay, you wouldn't vote for [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1761.9199999999998s)]
*  them. You would vote for the Democrats who would also adopt that position. You'd be like, well, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1767.76s)]
*  at least I know I trust Democrats more with healthcare than I do with the Republicans. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1772.64s)]
*  Why the f*** would I ever trust the Republican to pass a progressive bill on Medicare? That's it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1778.0s)]
*  I'll give you another example. Do you trust Donald Trump on abortion? He has moderated his [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1784.72s)]
*  position on abortion. Do you trust him? No. So shut the f*** up. All that does is make people [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1789.68s)]
*  understand. Yeah, no, abortion is a major problem for the Republican party. It's very obvious. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1795.6s)]
*  That's it. That's it. Well, people don't, people don't understand it. Like they just don't get it. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1800.48s)]
*  Anyway, JD Vance is saying he got groomed into thinking Trump was Hitler as a 35 year old Yale [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1806.24s)]
*  graduate man. That's one of my favorite moments of JD Vance where he's like, um, I actually also [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1811.6s)]
*  thought Trump was Hitler because the media duped me. I'm stupid. And I no longer think that anymore. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1817.52s)]
*  You're an idiot. Okay. You're an idiot. And there were plenty of missed opportunities. David Dayen [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1823.76s)]
*  also correctly pointed this out. Missed opportunity. I lost the mention that Vance's own portfolio [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1828.0800000000002s)]
*  company ship jobs overseas. There were plenty of instances where he could have hammered JD Vance [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1831.68s)]
*  as like a liberal elitist. Okay. That's like, that's the other thing. JD Vance is a serial liar. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1836.72s)]
*  He lied about, he lied about making up stories. He lied about the patients eating pets. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1844.16s)]
*  But I hated it. They agreed on so much. And then also there was that flub where Tim Wall said he's [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1854.16s)]
*  become friends with school shooters, which I thought was a funny little moment. Obviously he's [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1861.44s)]
*  like very nervous. That much is clear. Okay. And that JD Vance reiterated his commitment to being [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1866.24s)]
*  Adolf Hitler over and over and over again. You've got to see me. These folks know me. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1873.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm super passionate about this. The question come up on school shooting. We're talking about [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1878.72s)]
*  everything except school shooting. And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1882.56s)]
*  and it was a profound movement. David Hogg is a good friend of mine. You have seen me do this. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1887.9199999999998s)]
*  I've talked about being people where there are school shooters and I need to be more specific [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1892.8799999999999s)]
*  on that. But I am, I am passionate about this. This one for my wife and I is just as teachers, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1898.6399999999999s)]
*  as parents is so personal. Yeah. He is friends with one school shooter after last night. His [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1905.2s)]
*  name is JD Vance in 2018. I led a relational voter program in Wisconsin. We got 30 K Latino voters [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1910.24s)]
*  who wanted immigration reform. We got Tony Evers elected and helped Trump out of office in 2020. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1917.04s)]
*  This year I've talked to voters with immigrant parents who are parroting liberal talking points [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1921.04s)]
*  is infuriating to see the Dems just not correct the narrative on immigration. Yeah. Oh, don't worry. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1924.08s)]
*  They rely heavily on the Latino voters in Nevada. Okay. The entire culinary union is currently [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1929.84s)]
*  out door knocking for the Kamala Harris campaign. They know they know they need Latino voters. It's [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1936.56s)]
*  just ironic because they're literally activating Latino voters, some of which come from undocumented [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1942.08s)]
*  backgrounds or have undocumented relatives on us soil. They're literally getting the door knock [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1948.6399999999999s)]
*  for a campaign that is going to, you know, work on deporting them anyway. But yeah, it was, it was a [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1953.9199999999998s)]
*  tactical L in my opinion, in my estimation, where Tim Walz did not hammer JD Vance at all. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1960.8s)]
*  And obviously a lot of dummies love that the civility, right? They loved how civil the [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1970.1599999999999s)]
*  conversation was. That's not good. That means you love the conversation between JD Vance and Tim Walz. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1974.72s)]
*  A much better alternative here would at the very least be daggering JD Vance a couple times [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1981.6s)]
*  and separating himself from the moderate position that he was actually presenting himself as on the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1987.28s)]
*  largest stage that he's been on so far. Tim Walz is already well liked. JD Vance is not. JD Vance [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=1993.6s)]
*  basically did a fantastic job of advocating for JD Vance. Why can't Vance or Harris simply say [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2000.96s)]
*  that the people who have harmed the working class, Americans are rapacious billionaires. I think he [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2008.8799999999999s)]
*  means Tim Walz or Harris are rapacious billionaires like Trump and Peter Thiel, not immigrants who work [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2012.64s)]
*  themselves to the bone trying to give their kids a better life. There's another aspect of this that [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2017.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm very frustrated by like Americans love anecdotes. Okay, Americans love anecdotes. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2021.68s)]
*  We're not very intelligent as a collective. And one thing you got to do in that situation is rely [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2028.24s)]
*  on the anecdotes. Republicans do it all the time when they present this like hyper specific, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2034.24s)]
*  hyper emotional argument about like how rapist the migrants are, the migrant population is. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2040.24s)]
*  They point to like a literal handful of instances where migrants have done these kinds of heinous [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2046.32s)]
*  to make it seem like the entire migrant population is engaging in it. And it's very frustrating that [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2053.2s)]
*  the Democrats don't do that. I rarely ever hear from the Democrats about emotional anecdotes. They [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2057.84s)]
*  do it for abortion and they're very good at it for abortion. But they never do it for someone who has [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2063.76s)]
*  lost their house. They've they never do it for someone who is on the throes of homelessness as [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2069.28s)]
*  a consequence of being priced out of the market. They never do it for a migrant. They never do it [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2074.32s)]
*  for a migrant worker to humanize these people. Go talk to the United Fruit Workers or something [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2079.84s)]
*  like what are you talking about? They never do that. There is never any real stories about how [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2085.44s)]
*  these guys are your neighbors, man. You're on your goddamn neighbors. You're on normal people who are [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2091.6000000000004s)]
*  just like you and the Republican Party does this every day. It's very frustrating. Anyway, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2097.6s)]
*  another thing I say was Tim was convinced me that Minnesota is slightly better than most other [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2104.08s)]
*  places in the nation. Don't know what this means for the national race. Yeah, Tim was made the [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2107.68s)]
*  most effective argument putting Minnesota on the map in a big way. I will say that. Don't know if [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2112.48s)]
*  that's a good thing or a bad thing. Haven't been able to decide, but he certainly did do a good [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2118.48s)]
*  job with that. I am now a firm believer that Minnesota is a great place to go live at. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2123.52s)]
*  Inhanomar replied to me there as well. She said it is. So that was cool. Where else? What else [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2131.52s)]
*  were we going to do? I can't believe Vance literally used Waltz civility and normalcy as a way to draft [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2139.04s)]
*  his public image in a positive and normal light because Waltz isn't comfortable with opposing his [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2143.12s)]
*  opponent. I know Tim also has that same Bernie Sanders where he's just too much of a nice guy. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2147.68s)]
*  He was so goddamn nice. I mean, at a certain point I was like he's behaving like a goddamn Canadian. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2153.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay. Your reaction to it was the best. I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA, I was... [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2163.3599999999997s)]
*  He's just like he's too Minnesota and he's too Canadian coded. He's too Canadian adjacent. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2178.64s)]
*  Like he's just too nice. Stop being so nice, dude. Anyway, but yeah, one of my final statements on [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2184.24s)]
*  the debate was basically that if Dems are going to be this pro-Israel and neuter, whatever progressive [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2192.0s)]
*  momentum they would have gotten with the Waltz pick, they should have just went with Josh Shapiro. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2196.08s)]
*  Josh Shapiro at the very least would have locked down Pennsylvania for them and he would have been [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2199.8399999999997s)]
*  a more effective communicator. And I'm being honest about this. Josh Shapiro would have been [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2204.16s)]
*  a more effective communicator of Kamala Harris's dog policies, especially on the border and [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2209.92s)]
*  especially on Israel too. And beyond that, he would have done a better job defending... Yeah, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2215.04s)]
*  he would have done a better job defending all of like Kamala Harris's policies that like Tim [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
*  Waltz doesn't do a good job defending on. And he would have done a better job against JD Vance as [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2226.56s)]
*  well. Anyway, well, yeah, that's what we got. So let's hear what the media analysis is on the matter. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2231.04s)]
*  Events still unfolding and uncertain too, spart over who offers stronger leadership at this critical [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2239.52s)]
*  moment. Our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle. He will go to whoever has the most [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2245.6s)]
*  flattery or where it makes sense to him. Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2251.7599999999998s)]
*  witnessed in April, both Iranian attacks were repelled. Our coalition is strong and we need [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2256.56s)]
*  the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing. Governor Waltz can criticize Donald [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2262.32s)]
*  Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2266.72s)]
*  back to a very broken world. Donald Trump has already done it once before. In a presidential [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2273.12s)]
*  campaign that has been anything but civil, this was a strikingly civil and substantive debate. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2277.84s)]
*  Well, I've enjoyed tonight's debate. I think the media loves this. The media loves like, oh, look [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2284.0s)]
*  at how civil they were. And it was so substantive. They talked about policies. That only helps JD [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2288.16s)]
*  Vance straight up. That does not help the ticket for Kamala Harris at all. A substantive civil debate [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2294.24s)]
*  is not helping Tim Waltz. Make no mistake. It only makes JD Vance look like a moderate. That's why [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2303.36s)]
*  I'm so frustrated with the debate and the outcome of the debate. There was a lot of commonality here [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2310.8s)]
*  and I'm sympathetic to miss speaking on things and I think I might have with the Senator. But [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2315.36s)]
*  there's one. It wasn't until 90 minutes into the debate that the contentious topic of the last [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2320.0800000000004s)]
*  election came up. I would just ask that. You want to know why? You want to know why that's dangerous? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2325.84s)]
*  Because you, here, I'll give you a great example. Okay. My normie friends literally said these guys [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2331.92s)]
*  are so normal. Why can't they be the ones running? Okay. Do you want to know how devastating that is [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2336.96s)]
*  for Trump's policy with JD Vance is communicating? That means JD Vance, as I said to you, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2342.64s)]
*  conducted himself in such a moderate way that people forgot that he was actually speaking on [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2350.2400000000002s)]
*  Trump's policies. Okay. JD Vance was able to successfully communicate to a broad subsect [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2356.64s)]
*  of American voters that Trump's policies are actually normal and maybe even good because [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2364.56s)]
*  Americans are so aesthetic focused. You have to understand when someone communicates in a very [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2370.88s)]
*  civil manner. Okay. When he doesn't do that. Oh, they're here. Okay. Perfect. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2378.88s)]
*  They're not outside of them, but okay. You need to understand this is bad. This is really bad. If you [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2385.12s)]
*  hate the Republicans for their policies, this is really bad. Okay. If you even hate the Republicans [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2391.52s)]
*  for aesthetic reasons, this is still bad because this makes Republicans look normal. You don't want [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2396.64s)]
*  them to look normal. You don't want their Nazi attitude to be normal ever. Okay. Anyway, did he [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2401.2s)]
*  lose the 2020 election? Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2408.32s)]
*  speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation? That is a damning non-answer. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2414.64s)]
*  Vance insisted it is Democrats who are the biggest threat to democracy. Kamala Harris wants to [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2421.36s)]
*  speak government and big tech to silence people from speaking their minds. That is a threat to [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2427.36s)]
*  democracy that will long outlive this present political moment. A president's words matter. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2432.48s)]
*  A president's words matter. People hear that. So I think this issue of settling our differences [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2437.36s)]
*  at the ballot box, shaking hands when we lose, being honest about it, but to deny what happened [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2444.48s)]
*  on January 6th, the first time in American history that a president or anyone tried to overturn [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2451.6s)]
*  a fair election and the peaceful transfer of power. In the first part of the debate, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2458.56s)]
*  Governor Walz seemed nervous. He had trouble answering a question about whether or not he [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2462.48s)]
*  was in China during the Tiananmen Square uprising. My commitment, whether it be through teaching, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2467.44s)]
*  which I was good at, or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsIZfAOJA4&t=2472.56s)]
