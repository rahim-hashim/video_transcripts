# The Wildest Election In Wisconsin History | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ)
*  no matter how right-wing and stupid the average Republican voter is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  They are going to look at this and go, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  this is a dork ass loser with a foreign accent. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=9.0s)]
*  I don't fuck with this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=12.4s)]
*  And he has gay ass electric vehicles. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=14.4s)]
*  I don't like that either because a lot of us live in liberal enclaves [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=16.9s)]
*  and in liberal enclaves. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=22.6s)]
*  And in Battleground, Wisconsin, it is too early to call in the state Supreme Court race. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=24.0s)]
*  We are waiting for the very first results from Wisconsin. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=33.6s)]
*  So we do not have anything for you yet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=37.5s)]
*  CNN political director David Chalion is going to take a closer look at the race for us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=39.8s)]
*  David, Elon Musk, been a huge factor in the contest. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=44.1s)]
*  Tell us what the numbers show. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=46.2s)]
*  Yeah, the biggest factor, Jake, when you look at the money he has spent. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=47.2s)]
*  If you look at Elon Musk's money with himself and allied groups, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=50.2s)]
*  $22.6 million from Elon Musk and his allied groups are in this race. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=54.5s)]
*  Take a look how it lines up against other wealthy folks who have invested in this race on both sides of the aisle. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  And you'll see here in this stack, Elon Musk is in a category by himself with that 22.6. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=66.5s)]
*  You see the next Republican donors at 7.5 million. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=72.4s)]
*  If Elon Musk loses this, I'm going to be so happy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=75.9s)]
*  I'm calling it. I called it yesterday. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=78.6s)]
*  That this will be a major blow to Elon and it will kickstart. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=81.8s)]
*  It will rapidly accelerate the relationship deteriorating between Elon Musk and oh my God, I just realized something. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=86.8s)]
*  You dumb fucks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=96.3s)]
*  I just realized every time Asmongold goes offline, there is a infinitely larger amount of Asmongold said this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=98.5s)]
*  Asmongold said that commentary in my chat. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=106.3s)]
*  You fuckers watch Asmongold and then come in here when he goes offline to tell me what Asmongold has done today so you can make me watch his clips. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=109.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=120.2s)]
*  Every time bro around now I get a mysterious amount. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=122.4s)]
*  A suspicious amount of Asmongold said this Asmongold said that clips in the chat. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=128.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=134.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=136.3s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you, dude? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=138.7s)]
*  Actually, what the fuck is wrong with all of you? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=140.7s)]
*  Find God. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=143.6s)]
*  Chimol who himself has tied himself very closely to to President Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=144.7s)]
*  He dressed as him for Halloween last year even as we've seen, you know, just how much he has made his campaign race about the president. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=148.9s)]
*  Republicans are happy with the turnout in Wisconsin. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=155.3s)]
*  We are seeing presidential-level turnout in Waukesha County. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=158.6s)]
*  There are awards in Milwaukee that are over a thousand on pace November 20 24 numbers before 5 p.m. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  CST. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  Vainesville heavy red Ozaki County municipalities over 1200. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  We are on pace. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=171.1s)]
*  That's what the National Enterprise Director of TP Action said turning point action from turning point USA anything on the Florida races. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=172.6s)]
*  Yeah, they lost the Democrats lost both of the races in Florida. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's see how this goes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=186.2s)]
*  I really do a Republican who confirmed my memory who said that he would not have won likely without the early voting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=187.3s)]
*  So they are still holding on hope the Trump campaign. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=195.3s)]
*  The Republicans are holding on hope that early voting will be helpful in this race tonight. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=198.0s)]
*  But the Elon Musk factor is such a wild card because we already know he is going to be investing so much money. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  He already is in House and Senate races for the midterm. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=208.5s)]
*  So this isn't only a referendum on Donald Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=211.8s)]
*  It's a referendum on Elon Musk. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=214.4s)]
*  And that's Brad Schimel Brad Schimel. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=216.2s)]
*  I should notice we're waiting and watching as the White House is very much keeping an eye on this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=217.7s)]
*  The president's been tweeting and posting about the Florida results. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=221.6s)]
*  Obviously, they are also waiting to see what happens in Wisconsin because the Supreme Court there is always such the arbiter of these hot button issues that we've been focused so closely on. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  They've got a divided government there and the Supreme Court plays a huge role in that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=232.7s)]
*  But I think you make a great point about Elon Musk in terms of when he was having such a huge role in the 2024 election. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=236.7s)]
*  We had not seen him yet as special government employee Elon Musk in charge of Doge with even concerns from some Republicans at times. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=242.5s)]
*  So a lot of them obviously praise him publicly. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  This is kind of maybe the first time to get an indication of that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=252.9s)]
*  And the president obviously has such a strong political acumen that when it comes to reading the tea leaves, there is a question of how much he'll be looking at that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  I think without question, but for Trump, it's sort of a win-win because if they do lose tonight, he can sort of blame it on Elon Musk. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=263.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, at the beginning of this Trump administration, my question is, we've been talking to advisors here all day who've been watching this very carefully. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=271.2s)]
*  We heard from Ron Johnson, the Republican senator from Wisconsin earlier tonight, raising questions about the president's economic agenda. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=279.0s)]
*  The tariffs that he's going to announce from here at the White House that really affects dairy farmers and affects the manufacturing sector in Wisconsin. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  So that's what this race is also about. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=293.5s)]
*  So I think I'm a hobbit in the Shire, Wisconsin, and I have a feeling that Crawford is going to win. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=296.7s)]
*  You should totally guest army so I can be your Wisconsin, Ed and German. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=302.0s)]
*  A hobbit in the Shire, Wisconsin. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=305.4s)]
*  Cutting of programs in Washington have been local issues because things are being cut in their neighborhoods, research facilities and other things. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=311.4s)]
*  So that is also what is so fascinating by this sort of an early look at the first quarter, if you will, this administration. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I could see what it means for the role he plays in the midterms, where obviously his unlimited funds could have a major factor in that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=325.0s)]
*  Jeff Zeleny, thank you for that. Anderson, back to you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=332.8s)]
*  Yeah, Caitlin, thanks very much. Elon Musk was on Fox earlier today talking about the money he has put in to Wisconsin and why he's so involved in Wisconsin. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=335.3s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=344.7s)]
*  The House is currently Republican by a razor thin margin, which means that losing this judge race has a good chance of causing Republicans to lose control of the House. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=346.29999999999995s)]
*  This is so bad. Him being the spokesperson for the National Republican Party is not a good idea. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  These guys are letting this billionaire do whatever he wants. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  It's fine to pump and dump money into the races, but the moment that this uncharismatic charlatan is the spokesperson for the National Republican Party, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=371.6s)]
*  I'm sorry, no matter how right wing and stupid the average Republican voter is, they are going to look at this and go, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  This is a dork ass loser with a foreign accent. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=393.0s)]
*  I don't fuck with this and he has gay ass electric vehicles. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=396.4s)]
*  I don't like that either because a lot of us live in liberal enclaves and in liberal enclaves, they love Elon Musk. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  All the right wingers here are griped up dorks who are constantly getting into cryptocurrency schemes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=409.29999999999995s)]
*  That is not representative of the broader Republican Party in places like Wisconsin, in places like Idaho. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  Can you imagine a 65 year old dude in Idaho being like, yeah, I love this weird dork ass loser with a stupid accent. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=426.7s)]
*  I think it's great that he's just like trying to describe what the Republican Party's next steps should be. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=435.5s)]
*  Well, Democrats have billionaires too. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=446.7s)]
*  I guess it just depends on if you get the right politics, it's okay. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=448.8s)]
*  You know, I think the reason he's using these. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=452.3s)]
*  Shut the fuck up Scott Jennings. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=455.3s)]
*  There's never been a Democrat, a Democrat billionaire donor that has been this active in manipulating elections. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=456.3s)]
*  If there was, you would have advocated to assassinate that person. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=464.7s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=468.8s)]
*  George Soros is not even remotely comparable to what Elon Musk is doing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=470.2s)]
*  George Soros is 858 years old. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=475.7s)]
*  Okay, he is not running around the country associating his face with the Democratic Party. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=478.4s)]
*  You're out of your goddamn mind. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=484.8s)]
*  And George Soros and the amount of money that he spends as a 7 billionaire, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=486.9s)]
*  which is nothing in comparison to the 300 billionaire that Elon Musk is, is marginal in comparison to Elon Musk. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=500.9s)]
*  ...and a presidential race and then inserted themselves in the daily affairs of governing. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=502.3s)]
*  And we're looking at the 20 million dollars that Elon Musk has dumped into this campaign, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=507.9s)]
*  which dwarfs spending by even other rich Republicans, let alone the 2 million or like 3 million combined from JB Pritzker and Soros. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=512.2s)]
*  This is not comparing apples to oranges. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=521.6s)]
*  Anyway, this is a grape and a watermelon. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=523.4s)]
*  And so people in Wisconsin... [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=525.3s)]
*  How much is, how much is acceptable? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=526.6s)]
*  What's the limit? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=527.9s)]
*  Well, I think we should get big money out of politics. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=528.7s)]
*  I am very clear about getting big money out of politics. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=530.7s)]
*  I think there should be contribution limits. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=533.9s)]
*  And I think that a person who is... [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  It has always been clear that people that donate at that level have... [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  One percent of votes in and nothing from, nothing from Madison yet. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  One percent of, one percent of votes in and it's all from Waukesha. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=548.6s)]
*  It's Jover. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=553.1s)]
*  Isn't Waukesha where Kyle Rittenhouse is? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=554.3s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse came to? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=559.9s)]
*  That's where Waukesha is, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=562.4s)]
*  Or is he from Waukesha? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  Waukesha is incredibly right-wing chat. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=567.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=569.3s)]
*  Or no, he went to Kenosha. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=570.5s)]
*  Oh no, it wasn't. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=573.4s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=575.4s)]
*  I'm thinking of Kenosha. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  But wait, Waukesha is also fucking a place where there's like constantly neo-Nazi rallies and shit, no? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=578.0s)]
*  It's very, very white flight and very, very racist. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=586.9s)]
*  It's patriot, it's patriot country. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=592.5s)]
*  Elon Musk, which is something Trump's fine doing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=594.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=596.5s)]
*  Let's go back to Jake. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=597.1s)]
*  Thanks Anderson. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=598.2s)]
*  We have a key race alert for you now. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=598.8s)]
*  The polls closed in Wisconsin about 11 minutes ago. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=603.8s)]
*  And right now we have some votes, not a lot. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=606.3s)]
*  But conservative Brad Schimel is ahead with 63.9% of the vote. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=609.0s)]
*  It's over! [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=613.8s)]
*  Liberal Susan Crawford has 36.1% of the vote. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=614.3s)]
*  Wave the white flag, it's over. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=616.8s)]
*  It's just like the election night all over again. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=618.5999999999999s)]
*  Schimel is up by 398 votes. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=620.4s)]
*  Obviously, this is a mere scattering, a sampling of votes. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=621.0999999999999s)]
*  Where are the mules? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=624.4s)]
*  And John King, where is this, I don't know what you would call them, it's a little sprinkle, a little dusting of votes. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  Where are they coming from? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=635.4s)]
*  It's a first sample, Jake. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=636.3s)]
*  They're coming from where Brad Schimel calls home. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=637.6999999999999s)]
*  They're coming from right here in the suburbs west of Milwaukee, in Waukesha County. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=639.9s)]
*  He is a Waukesha County judge. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=644.8s)]
*  Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=647.6s)]
*  Again, one more time, I'm going to explain this one more time. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=649.8s)]
*  You're used to seeing red and blue at home. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=652.9s)]
*  I know that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  So this is going to be confusing for a lot of people. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=654.6s)]
*  On paper, judicial elections in Wisconsin are nonpartisan. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=656.6s)]
*  So we list them as purple. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=659.6999999999999s)]
*  Again, with all the money going in here, all the politics. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=661.5s)]
*  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=663.7s)]
*  Be for real CNN. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=665.2s)]
*  Be for fucking real dog. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=666.4000000000001s)]
*  He actually was a Republican statewide attorney general. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=668.0s)]
*  But this is where he is a county judge in Waukesha County. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=669.2s)]
*  So he is winning there by a decent margin early on. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  But it's a tiny percentage of the vote. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=675.5s)]
*  But this county will be absolutely key. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=677.2s)]
*  It always is in Wisconsin. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=679.5s)]
*  Wisconsin has a pretty good code. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=681.0s)]
*  So I'm going to look and show this up here. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=682.6s)]
*  You're looking at all the blank map right now. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=683.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to go back to the presidential map to show you. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=685.6s)]
*  Wisconsin has a pretty predictable code. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=687.9000000000001s)]
*  It's very, very, very competitive elections. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=690.6s)]
*  So let's pick 2024 and let's bring up the presidential race again. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=692.5s)]
*  Donald Trump, both times he was elected president, now only won Wisconsin. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=696.0s)]
*  By almost 30,000 votes this time, it was 21,000, 22,000 before that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=699.6s)]
*  But where were we a minute ago? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=703.6s)]
*  Waukesha, just west here of Milwaukee, right? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=705.2s)]
*  So you see right here. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=707.1s)]
*  For Democrats, you have to run it up in Milwaukee, run it up in Dane County. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=708.2s)]
*  That's Madison. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=712.2s)]
*  That is where Susan Crawford is a county judge in that county. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=713.0s)]
*  Democrats have to run it up there. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=716.0s)]
*  And then it almost always comes down to what are called the wild counties, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=717.5s)]
*  which is Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=721.4s)]
*  That is the suburban loop around there. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=726.5999999999999s)]
*  And what happened in 2024 is Donald Trump won them. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=728.8s)]
*  He also won them in 2016. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=732.1999999999999s)]
*  Harris actually did a little better than Biden in 2024 in these counties. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=733.6999999999999s)]
*  So here's one of the questions, right? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=737.3s)]
*  Trump is popular there. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=739.3s)]
*  Trump won those counties. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=740.5999999999999s)]
*  The question is what happens in this judicial race when there are both critical state issues, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=741.9s)]
*  abortion rights, voting rights, and so on. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  And of course, the nationalized climate, including Elon Musk being out there. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=749.2s)]
*  You see right there. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=752.7s)]
*  Someone asked why is this so regional? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=753.6s)]
*  This is so regional. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=756.4s)]
*  Why is this so pivotal? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=757.1s)]
*  It's regional because it's about where the race is white people escape to. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=758.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=764.1s)]
*  Areas of urbanization mean that there is going to be a liberal tendency. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=765.1s)]
*  It's a more diverse environment. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  It means that like the white people that live in Wisconsin is very white regardless, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=772.3000000000001s)]
*  but it's the white people that weren't like, oh my God, there's black people here. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=777.5s)]
*  We must escape versus white people in parts of the state where they went. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=781.8s)]
*  Oh my God, there's black people. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  We must escape. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=788.6s)]
*  It's white on white crime. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=789.6999999999999s)]
*  It's the it's the normal kind of white person who's just like, yeah, I don't really why [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=792.6s)]
*  would I move away because I have black neighbors versus white people that are like, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=797.0s)]
*  oh my God, there are black people here. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=802.3s)]
*  We have to literally build an enclave instantly. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=804.7s)]
*  Also picking two different shades of purple for this race is insane work, especially when [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=808.6s)]
*  the liberal one is the darker shade of purple. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  What the fuck are you guys doing? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=816.6s)]
*  There were no consequences because of the issues at stake in the state, let alone the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=818.0s)]
*  national conversation. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=821.9000000000001s)]
*  They also had like a recall election of the governor or something like that, right? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  Or something like that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=826.2s)]
*  There were others. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=827.0s)]
*  Attempts. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=827.9000000000001s)]
*  Scott Walker. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=830.0s)]
*  Anyway, only 1% of the vote in Wisconsin, but the votes are coming in. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, long way to go watching that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=834.9000000000001s)]
*  Jake, thanks very much back here with the team. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=837.4000000000001s)]
*  Again, just this is a Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=840.1s)]
*  A hundred million dollars being spent. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=845.1s)]
*  It's it's insane. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=846.6s)]
*  It is insane. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=848.1s)]
*  And yeah, it's not good. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=848.9000000000001s)]
*  It's not good for the future of American democracy. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=850.5s)]
*  Just like to do that for nothing to see here. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  Like what a country this would be. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=855.5s)]
*  But I want to say pick up on a point that Scott made in the last segment about the Republicans [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=857.3000000000001s)]
*  really leaning into this being all politics is national. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=862.2s)]
*  I actually think that that is true for the low-previncibility voters that you have in [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=866.0s)]
*  your party. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=869.5s)]
*  They connect the political experience right now to Donald Trump, this national figure. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=870.5s)]
*  This is a challenge and an opportunity for Democrats right now because the national narrative [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=875.4000000000001s)]
*  of Donald Trump is what it is, right? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=880.9000000000001s)]
*  We all know it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=883.1s)]
*  And but the reason why those low-prepensity Trump voters need to care about the local [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=884.2s)]
*  impact is that when Donald Trump makes a national implies tariffs across blanket tariffs, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=890.0s)]
*  it impacts you locally. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=896.3000000000001s)]
*  When he does things to Medicaid and Medicare, it impacts your local office where they won't [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=898.0s)]
*  be able to pick up the phones. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=902.5s)]
*  All of these national politics have local consequences. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=903.8000000000001s)]
*  And so I think it's been a challenge in different eras for both of our parties. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=907.0s)]
*  But right now, based off of the election in November, Republicans were able to see [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=911.2s)]
*  not that Democrat has a big chance of having an opportunity to make that national impact [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=916.2s)]
*  to their local pocketbook issue. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=922.2s)]
*  There's no votes from Milwaukee nor Madison. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=923.7s)]
*  The costs are going to go up for the American people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=927.2s)]
*  It's over, dude. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=929.2s)]
*  Yeah, let me tell you something, okay? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=930.7s)]
*  But these are just at a certain point in this night, you are going to look at this map and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=933.2s)]
*  the map is going to be all red. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=939.2s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=941.7s)]
*  That doesn't mean anything because land doesn't vote. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=946.2s)]
*  We need to, we need to make it mandatory to show like population density maps where they [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=947.2s)]
*  show like where actually the people live in comparison to other places, other places in [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=951.4000000000001s)]
*  the state, because that is meaningless. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=958.3000000000001s)]
*  Seeing a full red map does not mean anything. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=961.5s)]
*  I think it's why when Donald Trump goes up to Roberts and at the joint congress and is [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=963.5s)]
*  like thank you, I won't forget, we're like forget what? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=970.1s)]
*  You know, like wait a minute. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=973.3s)]
*  But he did rebuke him shortly after. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=974.8s)]
*  He did, he did, but it gives pause. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=976.3s)]
*  I mean if somebody helps you get someplace, the fear is that when you want judges to be [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=978.3s)]
*  impartial, and I would hope that I don't know these people, so I would assume that both [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=984.1s)]
*  will be impartial. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=988.2s)]
*  Are you implying that because Clarence Thomas wrote on somebody's plane and they're both [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=989.2s)]
*  I disagree with this. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=993.3s)]
*  I think look, I actually think whoever wins this race. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=994.3s)]
*  Shocking. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=998.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean one is a liberal jurist, one is a more conservative jurist. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=999.5999999999999s)]
*  I would expect that most of the time they would wind up adhering to their legal and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1003.6999999999999s)]
*  perhaps personal political ideology on most cases. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1009.8s)]
*  I actually think we are a little cynical about, I'm a big fan of candidates. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1013.4s)]
*  I like it when people run for office no matter what. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1018.3s)]
*  I respect it and I just don't think people are that easily bought. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1020.5s)]
*  Now that's not to say people haven't been bought in the course of American history, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1023.9s)]
*  but I guess I'm going to go glass half full on your question. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1027.6s)]
*  Well there's also correlation between how long the term they're serving for is, how [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1029.7s)]
*  independent they're able to be, and if they have a shorter term. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1033.6s)]
*  I think in a House race where you're basically constantly running for re-election, someone [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1036.3s)]
*  cuts you a massive check to your super PAC, there's a bit, but even a six years in the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1039.8s)]
*  Senate, you see senators break significantly more with presidents than you do House members. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1044.9s)]
*  If it's a decade long or longer judicial appointment, there's going to be a lot more independents. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1049.6s)]
*  Mandela, we got you. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1053.2s)]
*  I can tell you even from my own experience, I've had people who donated heavily to my [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1054.2s)]
*  campaign, who I've never met before, who don't even want to hear from me. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1057.5s)]
*  And this is a different situation because Elon Musk has inserted himself in every aspect, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1061.4s)]
*  almost of our lives at this point. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1066.3s)]
*  And I was trying to say to Ashley too, you know, I brought you into this role, I can [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1068.4s)]
*  take you out. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1071.2s)]
*  That is the mentality of an Elon Musk or a Donald Trump. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1072.2s)]
*  So sure there's going to be influence. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1074.4s)]
*  Most people wouldn't even know Brad Shimo's name if it weren't for the money that Elon [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1075.9s)]
*  Musk has spent. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1078.4s)]
*  I expect more votes to come in from Wisconsin, but turn out to be as close as the Democrat [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1080.3000000000002s)]

*  Also a head will join the Democratic Senate Cory Booker fresh from his record breaking [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1085.3000000000002s)]

*  Don't worry. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1100.3000000000002s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1102.3000000000002s)]

*  And she said, but you know, you come home from a day of that kind of work and you can't, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1109.2s)]
*  you don't talk to your family for half an hour after you get home. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1114.2s)]
*  Decompress. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1117.2s)]
*  Yeah, I got to go decompress. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1118.2s)]
*  She said, my kids are little in a grade school and they want to tell you about their day [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1120.2s)]
*  and you can't because you got to do that first. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1124.2s)]
*  And she said, you don't, you don't talk to your kids. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1127.2s)]
*  You interrogate your kids. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1129.2s)]
*  What? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1131.2s)]
*  But she reminded me of an example. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1134.2s)]
*  We had picked up my older daughter. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1137.1000000000001s)]
*  She was seven or eight at the time. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1138.1000000000001s)]
*  And there was a, she had told a lie, the kind of lie an eight year old tells. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1140.1000000000001s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1145.1000000000001s)]
*  But we're driving home from picking her up at her friend's house and I adjusted the rear [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1146.1000000000001s)]

*  So I got her. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1154.1000000000001s)]
*  Boom. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1155.1000000000001s)]

*  I start catching her. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1160.1000000000001s)]

*  All of a sudden I get a Perry Mason moment. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1163.1000000000001s)]

*  But I get a Perry Mason moment. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1168.0s)]
*  All of a sudden she's confessing on the witness stand in the back seat. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1170.0s)]
*  And I'm feeling good like next witness. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1173.0s)]

*  Interesting stuff. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1391.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1392.24s)]
*  Not really about either of the candidates per se. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1393.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1396.32s)]

*  happened in these races. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1401.8s)]
*  I will say you know when you talk to someone like Tammy Baldwin who has consistently beaten [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1403.72s)]
*  the odds and won in Wisconsin you see how it's done and it's a grassroots effort and [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1408.48s)]
*  she's ahead. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1414.38s)]

*  She's ahead right now and she is we always knew it's going to be a close race but I think [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1416.38s)]
*  your first the first thing you said was most important. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1420.18s)]
*  It's the most expensive race in the history of judicial races in the nation and that is [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1423.28s)]
*  because it's been escalated by the likes of Elon Musk. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1428.0600000000002s)]

*  It's not for sale. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1436.02s)]
*  And that's when it resonate with the people. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1437.02s)]

*  She was a prosecutor circuit judge. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1459.04s)]
*  Imagine being her. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1461.48s)]
*  She goes from being a circuit judge running and suddenly Elon Musk is wearing a cheese [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1462.48s)]
*  hat in her state and giving away million dollar checks. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1465.52s)]
*  That's what our politics has become right now. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1469.28s)]
*  But I think what you're seeing is that we are not. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1471.58s)]
*  We are in this fight in a big way. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1474.3s)]
*  And that's why you saw the race turn over in Pennsylvania where you see these tightening [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1476.1799999999998s)]
*  numbers in deep red districts in Florida where we're beating the odds by double points from [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1479.78s)]
*  before people are turning out and voting. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1485.78s)]
*  It seems like the nationalizing of the race though is so much more important for Republicans [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1488.52s)]
*  than it is for Democrats to a degree because they really do need you know Schimel is basically [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1493.1s)]
*  like getting as close to Donald Trump and Elon Musk as he possibly can even though he [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1497.8400000000001s)]
*  doesn't have an R next to his name because his the voters that he needs to come out really [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1502.8s)]
*  need those people to mean something to them to get them out of their homes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1507.68s)]
*  I think the Democrats in a weird way in Wisconsin might be benefiting from not having a clear [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1512.8400000000001s)]
*  leader like there's really no one out there that they can tag her with and she can run [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1518.2s)]
*  whatever race she wants to run she can run a little bit against Elon Musk and run on [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1524.46s)]
*  some of these other issues. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1528.02s)]
*  It's a different dynamic than you typically see but I think here you actually have the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1530.34s)]
*  Republicans really needing to make this about more than just the state Supreme Court making [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1537.22s)]
*  it about these broader dynamics. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1542.46s)]
*  Senator when you were out there most recently where do you think swing voters are right [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1543.9399999999998s)]
*  now? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1549.46s)]
*  Are they still in the mold of being willing to give Donald Trump a chance here or have [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1550.6000000000001s)]
*  they moved on already? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1556.32s)]
*  They're getting tired of this I did a 14 county stops in my own state in rural areas and there [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1558.28s)]
*  are farmers showing up there was one small town hall where one of the activists had a [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1564.96s)]
*  sign that said this is not normal and the farmer looked over and said what does that [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1569.96s)]
*  mean they didn't they're showing up because they're they're not activists but they're [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1573.96s)]
*  starting to see these terrorists are devastating to them. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1579.06s)]
*  They've got input costs up they don't have stability they've got farm funds. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1582.46s)]
*  Who you supporting is a fucking Supreme Court election in Wisconsin are you kidding me who [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1587.98s)]
*  am I supporting I'm supporting Crawford who I'm supporting literally a wet towel a stinky [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1593.98s)]
*  wet towel if the stinky wet towel is the anti-Elon anti-Trump vote. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1602.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1608.72s)]
*  Oh yeah for the record yeah Dems are voting for a vote voter ID it's going to pass that's [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1609.72s)]
*  why I haven't been looking at the voter ID people are like oh voter ID requirement like [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1613.64s)]
*  scroll down and check that one out. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1618.8000000000002s)]
*  That's not indicative of this race Democrats will absolutely vote for voter ID requirement. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1620.8400000000001s)]
*  Democrats have certainly gotten way more way way way more right wing. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1625.88s)]
*  Ironically enough a voter ID requirement might not necessarily hurt the Democrats in the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1629.94s)]
*  long run especially given that high propensity voters are at the heart of the Democratic [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1634.7s)]
*  Party might even cook the Republicans down the line. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1642.78s)]
*  So yeah voter suppression voter suppression because that's what voter ID is but voter [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1645.7s)]
*  suppression unironically me may be a benefit to the Democrats if they keep going down the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1651.18s)]
*  path that they're going to stand by for the next batch of votes to drop plus Democratic [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1655.78s)]
*  New Jersey Senator Cory Booker just spoke. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1660.0800000000002s)]

*  That's hilarious. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1698.3200000000002s)]
*  The Democrats and the Republicans together are going to cause the 10 the 10 person vote. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1700.5600000000002s)]

*  Who is more likely to have a passport. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1712.0800000000002s)]
*  Most Americans don't. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1713.76s)]

*  Yeah. See US passport holders 57 percent liberals 48 percent conservatives. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1798.56s)]
*  Also this is liberal versus conservative not Republican voter versus Democrat voter. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1803.42s)]
*  I'm willing to bet that even a big chunk of those conservatives are still Democratic Party voters. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1808.5s)]

*  and just told them very emotional stories too that really sourced me through the challenge. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1932.86s)]
*  It was obviously a very emotional experience. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1937.52s)]
*  Just one more question on the physical. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1939.48s)]
*  You were a football star at Stanford University. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1942.44s)]
*  You're 56 years old now but but you were 20 something years ago. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1946.12s)]
*  Was this more difficult than being a football star and taking some of those hits on the gridiron. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1951.12s)]
*  It was just different my friend. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1958.52s)]
*  It was just different. This was real you know physical challenge. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1960.04s)]
*  I had to think of a lot of strategic things to do in order to prepare for it. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1963.9s)]
*  And then and you're right I'm a lot older than that football player a lot less hair too. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1968.18s)]
*  So it was a challenge it was a trial but I really felt lifted by the energy as Congress people started [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1975.18s)]
*  coming over a lot of my CBC Congressional Black Caucus friends. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1981.14s)]
*  It just turned out to be when the gallery started filling up it was a lot of folks energy that really [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1985.0600000000002s)]
*  carried me to try to do is I sort of framed the whole speech with John Lewis's demand. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1990.28s)]
*  All of us is this is fear just talked a lot about doing have doing good trouble. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=1995.92s)]
*  Necessary trouble. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2002.84s)]
*  You know it was very moving part of your speech. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2005.32s)]
*  You should note the previous record was said rather indivisibly by then Democrat about eventually [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2007.24s)]
*  became a Republican Senator Strom Thurmond who was filibustering the Civil Rights Act in 1957. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2013.98s)]
*  You weren't filibustering anything. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2021.54s)]
*  You were giving this speech. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2024.54s)]
*  So not to block legislation but I want to know what do you say to somebody who says why were you doing [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2027.5s)]
*  this. Other people have done it to block legislation. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2036.54s)]
*  Ted Cruz did it to try to stop Obamacare. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2039.0s)]
*  I think he was doing it in 2013 maybe. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2042.84s)]
*  Your friend Senator Chris Murphy who was there with you the whole time did it to try to get some gun [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2046.24s)]
*  anti-gun legislation votes. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2052.4s)]
*  Tell us the purpose of this. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2055.48s)]
*  I think we're really at a point in America where things are happening that don't sit right with people of [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2058.16s)]
*  both sides of the aisle. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2063.0s)]

*  Institute while talking about just the insanity of trying to pass a budget right now that's going to [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2069.9s)]
*  blow the biggest single president record for creating more debt more deficit giving tax cuts that are [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2074.6600000000003s)]
*  disproportionately going to go to the wealthiest Americans who don't need that tax cut. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2082.02s)]
*  And then all the while gutting things like Medicaid it just makes no sense. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2086.3s)]
*  There are so many things going on by this president who is trashing our allies bullying Canada who is [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2090.6s)]
*  many ways just violating judges orders trampling on our Article 1 power. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2097.7999999999997s)]
*  So I just wanted to give a speech that said that this is not normal. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2103.56s)]
*  We can't normalize it. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2107.6s)]
*  And all of us have a responsibility to do something different to take some risks to be there for each [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2109.2s)]
*  other and to try to ignite a larger movement in our country. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2115.68s)]
*  The kind of movement that stopped Donald Trump for taking away the Affordable Care Act and perhaps together [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2118.8599999999997s)]
*  collectively if we all speak out Republicans Democrats independents to the absurdity of some of this [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2123.7799999999997s)]
*  perhaps we can make changes and change some policies and get some other Republicans to change their votes [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2129.66s)]
*  to stop bad things from happening. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2134.94s)]
*  Just to play a little bit more of your speech you did acknowledge Senator Strom Thurmond and his record [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2136.8199999999997s)]

*  of average people. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2181.5600000000004s)]

*  He wants to run for office. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2387.8999999999996s)]
*  But I'm telling you right now it's not better than nothing though. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2390.06s)]
*  I disagree. This is amusing the filibuster you see him basically spinning in the face. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2392.3399999999997s)]

*  The resentment that I have is the resentment that I have is that Cory Booker is a representation of the [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2402.2400000000002s)]
*  establishment Democrats. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2408.44s)]
*  OK. He is the party man. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2410.4s)]
*  He represents the party line. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2413.1400000000003s)]
*  And what he's doing here is an optical victory but not a real victory an optical victory that is not associated [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2415.2400000000002s)]
*  with anything but maybe elevating Cory Booker's career. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2423.48s)]
*  If this lights a fire under the ass of all congressional Democrats then fantastic. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2427.06s)]
*  That's good. If they start like obstructing everything no matter how silly it might seem whether it's an [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2431.98s)]
*  appointment or whether it's like judge appointments whether it's an appointment for a cabinet seat if they do that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2439.2999999999997s)]
*  Fantastic. OK. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2445.02s)]
*  And some are doing that. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2446.62s)]

*  Having said that Cory Booker's style Cory Booker's demeanor Cory Booker's rhetoric overall is still from the [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2450.96s)]

*  Then the key test is the suburbs. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2704.8999999999996s)]
*  I'll move the map up a little bit around. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2707.06s)]
*  This is where it gets Mitchell McConnell. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2708.9399999999996s)]
*  This is where Brad Schimel is from. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2710.54s)]

*  What the fuck is this? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2736.6s)]
*  Schimel at the moment is winning. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2737.64s)]
*  We've got a ways to go. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2738.8399999999997s)]
*  That looks like a big healthy margin and it is but it's a smaller margin than Trump beat [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2739.64s)]
*  Harris right there and this one here in Ozaukee County. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2743.9199999999996s)]
*  Schimel has just pulled ahead. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2747.8799999999997s)]
*  This was a 10-point win. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2749.12s)]
*  This was a 10-point win in this county for Trump [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2751.12s)]
*  just five months ago. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2753.12s)]
*  And so you see right now it's essentially even in that county. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2755.12s)]
*  So this is one of the questions, right? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2757.12s)]
*  There's no question Elon Musk's role here was huge. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2759.12s)]
*  Democrats have made him the new villain. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2761.12s)]
*  They've made him their turnout monster. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2763.12s)]
*  A lot of people who came there say the last event [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2765.12s)]
*  when Musk came out... Wait, who's Mitchell? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2767.12s)]
*  ...he said that might have backfired. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2769.12s)]
*  Even Republicans say that. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2771.12s)]
*  Well, he made it too personal out there. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2773.12s)]
*  But remember, this is an evenly divided Supreme Court. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2775.12s)]
*  A Democrat just left the court. A liberal just left the court. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2777.12s)]
*  I shouldn't call her a Democrat. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2779.12s)]
*  So the winner here, the ideological balance of the court [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2781.12s)]
*  will go to the winner. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2783.12s)]
*  Will it go to the conservative or will it go to the liberal? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2785.12s)]
*  Wisconsin has an abortion law that could be before the court. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2787.12s)]
*  Voting rights, drawing congressional, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2789.12s)]
*  drawing legislative districts, right? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=2791.12s)]

*  Gay Lenin in 1917. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3413.12s)]
*  No, dog, they called it already. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3415.12s)]

*  And those counties dropped [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3437.12s)]
*  spectacular numbers. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3439.12s)]
*  Like, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3441.12s)]

*  CNN has also called it. They're projecting [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3467.12s)]

*  both President Trump and Elon [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3489.12s)]
*  Musk, who had deep involvement [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3491.12s)]
*  in this race. Democrats obviously trying [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3493.12s)]

*  and actively involving himself in this race [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3511.12s)]
*  because he's such a narcissistic moron [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3513.12s)]

*  and got booed in his [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3529.12s)]

*  stay in control. It comes [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3547.12s)]
*  at a time when there's a lot of hot button [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3549.12s)]
*  issues that could come before [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3551.12s)]
*  the court, things like abortion rights and [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3553.12s)]

*  also comes as Crawford and [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3557.12s)]
*  her democratic allies have really sought [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3559.12s)]
*  to turn this campaign into a [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3561.12s)]
*  referendum of Elon Musk. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3563.12s)]
*  I can tell you, criss-crossing [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3565.12s)]
*  the state over the past week, that is something that [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3567.12s)]
*  we repeatedly heard from Crawford [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3569.12s)]
*  at each of her campaign events [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3571.12s)]
*  saying that Musk involvement [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3573.12s)]
*  in the race should be concerning for voters. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3575.12s)]
*  And it seems that at least [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3577.12s)]
*  in these results that are starting to come in tonight [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3579.12s)]

*  to God, like [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3607.12s)]
*  it would be very different. But he looks the way [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3609.12s)]
*  he looks, he operates the way [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3611.12s)]
*  he operates, he sounds the way [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3613.12s)]
*  he sounds, ain't nobody fucking with [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3615.12s)]
*  him. That's just not happening. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3617.12s)]
*  Indeed, and we've been talking about [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3619.12s)]
*  the huge... Sometimes politics is that [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3621.12s)]
*  stupid, okay? It's that [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3623.12s)]

*  a lot of [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3629.12s)]
*  there's a lot of [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3631.12s)]

*  like idol worship for [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3635.12s)]
*  Americans, especially for wealthy people and powerful people. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3637.12s)]
*  But Elon [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3639.12s)]
*  is too repulsive [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3641.12s)]
*  to be able to take advantage of that. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3643.12s)]
*  We'll put them up when we have them. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3645.12s)]
*  Yeah. Oh look, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3647.12s)]
*  this is an important win for Democrats [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3649.12s)]
*  in the state of Wisconsin. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3651.12s)]
*  It is not an indicator of [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3653.12s)]
*  where the overall country is [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3655.12s)]
*  in terms of political alignment. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3657.12s)]
*  But it is a testament [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3659.12s)]
*  that when you continue [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3661.12s)]
*  to organize, you have a clear message, you can [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3663.12s)]
*  win campaigns. And I think in a moment like [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3665.12s)]
*  that, right now, Democrats need [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3667.12s)]
*  to remember that and [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3669.12s)]
*  continue to cultivate what their message [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3671.12s)]
*  is ahead of the New Jersey and [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3673.12s)]

*  you bitch. Come [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3683.12s)]

*  That's not what we're saying. But it is [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3695.12s)]
*  giving an opportunity for Democrats to say, well, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3697.12s)]
*  who are these voters? Are they [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3699.12s)]
*  low-prevent or high-prevent [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3701.12s)]
*  voters that showed up because, and that's why [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3703.12s)]

*  In previous races in Florida, the [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3709.12s)]
*  Republican. It was a blowout. 30 some [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3711.12s)]
*  points, right? So you need, you want to find who are [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3713.12s)]
*  those voters in the difference in that [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3715.12s)]
*  margin between. And maybe [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3717.12s)]
*  you get some, draw some conclusions [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3719.12s)]
*  and maybe you don't. But data beyond [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3721.12s)]
*  just a presidential outcome, I think is [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3723.12s)]
*  important. Oh, do I think it would have [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3725.12s)]
*  gone different if Elon Musk didn't involve himself in this election? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3727.12s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3729.12s)]
*  I don't think it would have gone different. No. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3731.12s)]
*  For the reasons that I mentioned already. Oh, Scott's talking. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3733.12s)]
*  Any of these races in Florida or Wisconsin? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3735.12s)]
*  Or was it largely they just kept doing what they've [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3737.12s)]
*  been doing, which is showing up for Donald Trump and nothing [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3739.12s)]
*  else. That's one thing to be studied. I do think [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3741.12s)]
*  the Republican takeaways tonight [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3743.12s)]
*  are going to be this. In Florida, Democrats [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3745.12s)]
*  burned about 20 million dollars [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3747.12s)]
*  on two congressional campaigns where [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3749.12s)]
*  both Republicans look like they're going to get [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3751.12s)]
*  around 57 percent of the [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3753.12s)]
*  vote. Yes, that's less than what they [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3755.12s)]
*  burned in Wisconsin. Certainly [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3757.12s)]
*  commanding victories. Democrats were down in the low 40s. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3759.12s)]
*  Republicans again at 57 percent. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3761.12s)]
*  Wisconsin, the [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3763.12s)]
*  voter ID initiative that Donald Trump was heavily [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3765.12s)]
*  involved in and heavily supported. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3767.12s)]
*  That's a big issue for Republicans and conservatives. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3769.12s)]
*  Last I saw was passing at [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3771.12s)]
*  about a rate of 60-40. Go! [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3773.12s)]
*  So they're going to like that. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3775.12s)]
*  I agree with you that Democrats have a nice win [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3777.12s)]
*  on the Supreme Court here. Called it [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3779.12s)]
*  early in the night. But for Republicans tonight, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3781.12s)]
*  I do think a lot of people were sort of bracing [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3783.12s)]
*  for impact. You know, what was going [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3785.12s)]
*  to happen tonight and what do we find out? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3787.12s)]
*  Republicans are OK in their Florida districts [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3789.12s)]
*  and voter ID is still a popular [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3791.12s)]
*  thing. There's a bunch of people that voted for a liberal [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3793.12s)]
*  Supreme Court justice and turned around and voted [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3795.12s)]
*  voter ID tonight in Wisconsin, which shows [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3797.12s)]
*  you the popularity [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3799.12s)]
*  of that issue, which has been a Republican issue. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3801.12s)]
*  I think there's a significant [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3803.12s)]
*  disconnect between Republicans who feel like [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3805.12s)]
*  we're only four months into the Trump [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3807.12s)]
*  administration. There may have been some [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3809.12s)]
*  hiccups, but they're largely willing to give him [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3811.12s)]
*  some bandwidth to get his agenda [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3813.12s)]
*  into place. Even tomorrow when his Liberation [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3815.12s)]
*  Day is coming and these massive tariffs are going [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3817.12s)]
*  to go into effect, they're willing to give him [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3819.12s)]
*  a glide path to see if his plans actually [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3821.12s)]
*  work. I think Democrats to [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3823.12s)]
*  some degree may have overhyped that. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3825.12s)]
*  Florida is irrelevant ultimately [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3827.12s)]
*  because it's a fucking massive [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3829.12s)]
*  Trump state. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3831.12s)]
*  Wisconsin on the other hand was a close one. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3833.12s)]
*  Trump won Wisconsin [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3835.12s)]
*  by barely [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3837.12s)]
*  less than 1%. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3839.12s)]
*  Trump won Wisconsin in 2024 [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3841.12s)]
*  by less than 1%. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3843.12s)]
*  The reality of the matter is [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3845.12s)]
*  that [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3847.12s)]
*  the factors involved [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3849.12s)]
*  in why [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3851.12s)]
*  this blowout is taking [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3853.12s)]
*  place in Wisconsin for the liberals [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3855.12s)]
*  is because of the factors [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3857.12s)]
*  that I laid out earlier, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3859.12s)]
*  high propensity voters and their likelihood to go out [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3861.12s)]
*  and vote in special elections. Liberals [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3863.12s)]
*  love higher, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3865.12s)]
*  more educated, wealthier, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3867.12s)]
*  white liberals, liberals in general [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3869.12s)]
*  fucking love voting. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3871.12s)]
*  They love voting. They come [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3873.12s)]
*  every time they vote. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3875.12s)]
*  That's a big part of it. You also [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3877.12s)]
*  miss someone doing the Nazi salute? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3879.12s)]
*  Wait, what? I miss someone [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3881.12s)]
*  doing the Nazi salute in this video? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3883.12s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3885.12s)]
*  So [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3887.12s)]
*  I do think that with or without [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3889.12s)]
*  Elon, with or [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3891.12s)]
*  without Elon, the Democrats [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3893.12s)]
*  having said [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3895.12s)]
*  that, having said that, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3897.12s)]
*  with or without Elon, the days probably would have [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3899.12s)]
*  gone to the Democrats, but the margins [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3901.12s)]
*  look the way they are because [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3903.12s)]
*  of Elon. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3905.12s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3907.12s)]
*  Oh, this guy. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3909.12s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3911.12s)]
*  It's because the banner [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3913.12s)]
*  was hiding it. Did you guys see it? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3915.12s)]
*  This guy was SIG [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3917.12s)]
*  and going, my heart goes out to you. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3919.12s)]
*  Holy fuck. How did you [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3921.12s)]
*  clock that? That's crazy. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3923.12s)]
*  Gross. Fucking [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3925.12s)]
*  gross. Yeah, I didn't watch. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3927.12s)]
*  I didn't have time to listen to the Vox [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3929.12s)]
*  article or read the Vox article [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3931.12s)]
*  or listen to the Vox [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3933.12s)]
*  podcast that I was on. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3935.12s)]
*  We'll probably do [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3937.12s)]
*  that tomorrow. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3939.12s)]
*  I just wanted a recall election. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3941.12s)]
*  You brought me up to speed. I said this was the quickest [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3943.12s)]
*  a race I've ever been called to in Wisconsin [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3945.12s)]
*  because it usually lasts days. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3947.12s)]
*  And you noted that no, that [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3949.12s)]
*  was not the case. Your recall failed pretty quickly. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3951.12s)]
*  Less than an hour. So give us [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3953.12s)]
*  your analysis of what went right for [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3955.12s)]
*  Judge Crawford and what went wrong for Judge Schimel. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3957.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think two things, and I've said this for months. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3959.12s)]
*  I thought, one, the turnout model [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3961.12s)]
*  was always going to be at the disadvantage [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3963.12s)]
*  of Schimel over Crawford because there's about [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3965.12s)]
*  200,000 voters [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3967.12s)]
*  that voted for Donald Trump last November [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3969.12s)]
*  who just historically don't vote in spring [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3971.12s)]
*  elections. And so part of the reason [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3973.12s)]
*  why we wanted the president and others to be involved [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3975.12s)]
*  was to try and make, connect [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3977.12s)]
*  the dots, to make that connection. And some [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3979.12s)]
*  of it happened, but clearly not enough [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3981.12s)]
*  enough if you look at these results. Nothing was money. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3983.12s)]
*  Obviously a lot of attention of late to [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3985.12s)]
*  Musk, but if you look at the financial advantage, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3987.12s)]
*  Crawford's campaign spent twice as [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3989.12s)]
*  much as I did in my first election for governor. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3991.12s)]
*  So that shows you how much the stakes have been [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3993.12s)]
*  elevated considerably more than the Schimel [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3995.12s)]
*  campaign. And about the money paper, at least [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3997.12s)]
*  it was dominated by right-wing funding. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=3999.12s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4001.12s)]
*  Elon spent more money [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4003.12s)]
*  than every other fucking group [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4005.12s)]
*  combined on this race. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4007.12s)]
*  You heard maybe Mandela Barnes in the other panel in New York saying that he thought [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4009.12s)]

*  this is a state where [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4039.12s)]
*  your own citizens own the football team. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4041.12s)]
*  So do you think that was compelling? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4043.12s)]
*  I think it's an interesting tactic. It's a little [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4045.12s)]

*  all these billionaires who've spent far more [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4053.12s)]
*  than Musk did in this. And now pointing to say, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4055.12s)]
*  wait a minute. I don't think they spent on this they didn't. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4057.12s)]
*  Well, collectively, if you look at all [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4059.12s)]
*  the money from outside that was given to her, again, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4061.12s)]
*  77% of it came from out of state, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4063.12s)]
*  only 15% came from Schimel, and collectively, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4065.12s)]
*  a number of the analysis should have been [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4067.12s)]
*  done. I'm just saying, like, in terms of the money [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4069.12s)]
*  from J.D. Pritzker. Oh, individually, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4071.12s)]
*  if you look at the whole outside money that came from out of [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4073.12s)]
*  the state, clearly she had money. But you don't think it was [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4075.12s)]
*  a referendum on Musk at all, though? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4077.12s)]
*  Oh, I think it had a part of it. I think a lot of different issues. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4079.12s)]
*  I think, again, in Wisconsin, you see [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4081.12s)]
*  that flip back and forth. Elon is [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4083.12s)]
*  single-handedly made up like a I don't know what the exact percentage is, but he made up like a significant percentage of the donations for the race. Like personally. Okay. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4085.12s)]
*  You are so high. Yes. I oh my God. I hope he keeps trying to fucking manipulate elections. Actually, I really do. I fucking really do. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4099.12s)]
*  Mearsheimer fan Croffer got 23 million while Schimel got 11 million. But sure, keep pretending Democrats aren't the party of lobbyists and big donors. First of all, I fucking never said that Democrats are not the party of lobbyists and big donors. But it's so funny that Mearsheimer fan responds to me making fun of Elon Musk, who was the biggest outside billionaire donor. He's the biggest donor. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4109.12s)]
*  This is the first thing he tweeted retweeted since his last post in case he missed it. Vietnam has cut all tariffs on American goods in response to Trump's reciprocal tariffs. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4134.12s)]
*  Unite libs unite. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4147.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Billionaire donations of Wisconsin Supreme court race. I mean, this is not the entire picture. It's just billionaires that have donated to the race, but come on. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4149.12s)]
*  Come on, dude. Come on, dude. Come on, dude. Maybe he's not tweeting because he's, he's, he's trying to be, he's experimenting with biblical doses of ketamine. Let me Google this. Can you overdose on ketamine on ketamine? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4180.12s)]
*  Okay. This doesn't say it fucks with your kidneys. Permission to live out one nicer permission granted soldier. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4199.12s)]
*  For in 2026, I want to go back to Elon Musk for a second because I mean, it is true that he spent $20 million on affiliated groups that were involved in this race. It was at a risk for. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4229.12s)]
*  Can you, can you tell me why? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4244.12s)]
*  Elon tried really hard. Can you explain why you want cared about this race? Says skills shots fired. The answer is yes. The reason why he cared about this race is because Elon Musk has been claiming that he will be Donald Trump's attack dog. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4250.12s)]
*  Okay. He's been claiming that he's going to be Donald Trump's attack dog. He's going to use unlimited amounts of funds to primary Republicans that speak out of turn. He is basically trying to be the outsider that whips votes in favor of Donald Trump. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4264.12s)]
*  This was a real opportunity for Elon to test this strategy. This was a real opportunity for Elon to basically prove his work that he has the capability. He has the motion. He has the money and power to be able to win results for Donald Trump. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4277.12s)]
*  If he had won this race, his, his allegiance with Donald Trump would have calcified. It would have hardened. Okay. It would have turned into a, it would have definitely given a much, a much longer timeframe for Elon to keep dominating the country, to keep running the country in the ways that he sees fit. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4293.12s)]
*  And yes, there's a Tesla lawsuit, but that stuff is fine. It's like, okay, Tesla can't enter Wisconsin because they have an auto dealership lawsuit or whatever the fuck who cares that ironically is a lawsuit where I'm on Elon's side, by the way, surprisingly enough. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4311.12s)]
*  I think that auto dealership, the auto dealership union, capital union is insane. It's just ridiculous. That's not the real reason though. I think, I mean, I don't think Elon cares about fucking entering Wisconsin as a market that much. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4331.12s)]
*  I'm sure it'd be nice. It would be a nice little fucking, it would be a nice gift on top of that, but that's like secondary. The primary purpose here. The primary purpose here was because Elon wanted to prove his work. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4353.12s)]
*  Elon wanted to prove to Donald Trump that he had motion. He had money and that with money, he could dominate races and win them for big daddy Trump. He failed. If he had won, he could say, see, I got the money. I put the, I dumped the money there. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4367.12s)]
*  I went there. I got this victory for you, Mr. President. But instead the predictable outcome happened and it actually happened in a spec. It happened in a way that was a spectacular defeat for him. And I think part of the reason why the margins currently look the way they do in a state that Donald Trump won against Kamala Harris by 1%. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4383.12s)]
*  This special election showcasing a 55 to 44% split implies that people on top of their, their proclivity to go out and vote in special elections were extra annoyed with the presence of Donald Trump. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4408.12s)]
*  That's it. So that's it. People don't like Elon Musk and Trump hates fucking losers. So I think this will look like a spectacular defeat in the eyes of Donald Trump. And he likes to lay blame on others. He doesn't want to fucking say Trump will come out and say, Hey, look, the, the ballot measure that I wanted voter ID. It won. It won bigly. It won by wide numbers. But you know, I shouldn't be saying that. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4424.12s)]
*  I shouldn't have brought that South African to Wisconsin. He shouldn't have gone there. You know, he's too busy with his cars. He should go back to his cars. He shouldn't deal with it. He shouldn't deal with Wisconsin. It's okay. We still like them. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4454.12s)]
*  And I think that's what's going on. And yes, this is also not incorrect. The best part is Trump is going to ask you on the back down publicly, but keep funding the elections. But you want to such a petulant manchild. He will take his toys and go home. Yeah, two big egos to narcissistic assholes. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4467.12s)]
*  In one room, it was destined to fail. And I'll be honest, and I will admit, I was wrong. I thought that this relationship would have crashed and burned a long time ago. I forgot how much Trump loves money. Okay, he loves money so much. He is such a big fan of money. He is the number one fan of money. There's money, money, money. Okay. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4482.12s)]
*  I thought that that relationship would have fallen apart, fallen apart by the first month. I do think now, regardless of how much Trump loves money, he fucking hates losers. He will look to this and go, all right, you're done. It won't happen instantly. Remember tomorrow. Donald Trump will probably come out and defend Elon Musk. That's what I suspect. But it won't be like a full throated defense. I think it'll be told you look, look, voter ID, just a minute. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4505.12s)]
*  I'm going to prove to Wisconsin election. There it is. There it is. Democrats fought hard against this. This is a big win for Republicans. Maybe the biggest one of the night. It should allow us to win Wisconsin. Like I just did in the presidential election for many years to come. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4535.12s)]
*  No statement about the top of the ticket. No statement about what's happening at the top of the ticket. I'm telling you, he'll probably say something. He'll lightly defend Elon Musk tomorrow because he still likes money. But that doesn't mean that the relationship has not taken on significant damage. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4554.12s)]
*  But on that note, I will leave you with my outro. I love you all and I will see you tomorrow as always. And we will dissect. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kdGxu56fvQ&t=4581.12s)]
