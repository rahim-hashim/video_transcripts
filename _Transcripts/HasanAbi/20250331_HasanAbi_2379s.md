# Trump Boasts Of 'America's Rebirth' Using Made-Up Numbers | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E)
*  500 what do I mean by trillion? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=0.0s)]
*  5 trillion what are you referring to sir? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=3.0s)]
*  I think that we're gonna be at 5 trillion dollars of investment [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=4.7s)]
*  I think you're gonna have investments [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=8.2s)]
*  very short [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  f*** it dude [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=12.0s)]
*  yeah we're gonna get 7 quintrillion [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=13.0s)]
*  I made up the new number [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=16.0s)]
*  no one's ever seen numbers like this before [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=18.5s)]
*  it's quintrillion that's right [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=21.0s)]
*  quintuple billion [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=23.0s)]
*  new numbers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=25.5s)]
*  oh my god what the f*** is going on? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=31.0s)]
*  Kid Diddler Rock is in the White House? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=53.0s)]
*  in the Oval Office? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=55.0s)]
*  I repeat, Kid Diddler Rock is in the Oval Office [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=56.0s)]
*  this is not a drill [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=59.0s)]
*  Trump is going to obviously show him the attack plans against Iran [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=61.0s)]
*  as he did last time [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=65.0s)]
*  I think this is a great first step [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=89.0s)]
*  I would love down the road if there would be some legislation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=91.0s)]
*  that we could actually do to get the money [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=94.0s)]
*  and I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=97.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=99.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=101.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=103.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=105.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=107.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=109.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=111.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=113.0s)]
*  I think that's a great way to do it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=115.0s)]
*  I would love down the road if there would be some legislation [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=117.0s)]
*  that we could actually put a cap on the resale of tickets [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=119.0s)]
*  and I'm a capitalist and a deregulation guy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=121.0s)]
*  but they've tried this in some places [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=124.0s)]
*  in Europe and it seems to be the only thing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=126.0s)]
*  that's us, as artists being able to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=128.0s)]
*  be able to get the hands on colored tickets [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=130.0s)]
*  that they need [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=132.0s)]
*  That's the first one you say [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=134.0s)]
*  and I know the President doesn't like when I say this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=136.0s)]
*  I'm a little overpaid right now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=138.0s)]
*  it's kind of ridiculous [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=140.0s)]
*  I would rather be a hero to working class people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=142.0s)]
*  come attend my shows and give them a fair ticket price. I can't control that right now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=144.0s)]
*  So hopefully this is a step to really be able to make that happen. And a lot of artists [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=147.44s)]
*  and a lot of fans who love, love concerts and music are going to be very appreciative [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=152.28s)]
*  of you taking this case. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=156.12s)]
*  And I think Bob is more interested in the fans and the people that are having to pay [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=157.12s)]
*  crazy prices than he is the artist. Maybe the artist a little bit, but the fans a lot [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=162.2s)]
*  have spoken to him over the years about it. And it's- [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=166.96s)]
*  Who the f*** is going to kid did the rock shows in 2025, man? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=170.16s)]
*  What the hell? Maybe that's why he wants to be able to control ticket prices. Because [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=174.52s)]
*  he's like, no one is paying $75 with all the surcharges, with all the upcharges. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=178.88s)]
*  So he's like, please, Mr. President. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=183.72s)]
*  And that's the only time they've enforced that act. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=189.52s)]
*  And who's the primary culprit? Who sells these tickets? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=193.52s)]
*  It's the scalpers. It's the, these bots go in and they're automated. So you're- [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=197.04s)]
*  Is there a company involved? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=201.24s)]
*  You might not want to say. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=204.0s)]
*  No, no. Well, there's reselling markets. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=205.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=207.2s)]
*  I know Peter. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=208.2s)]
*  But that's all right. Don't get them involved. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=210.72s)]
*  What company do you think it is? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=212.32s)]
*  Maybe they're more innocent than we think. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=213.24s)]
*  Well, if you think of it like if Ticketmaster sells a ticket, if you buy a ticket and go [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=215.76s)]
*  to a show, you're in a lot of ways their worst customer. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  Because they make another 17, whatever percentage every time that ticket resales. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=223.92s)]
*  So they don't want to enforce the bots act necessarily because they're making more money [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=227.24s)]
*  off it. The artists don't see any of that money. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=230.92s)]
*  But that's not what I'm advocating for is for me to make more money. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=232.76s)]
*  I want the fans to have fair ticket prices, be able to go and enjoy more shows. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  I know people that can only they decide on a family vacation or going to their favorite [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=239.56s)]
*  concert once a year rather than, you know, my parents used to go see multiple shows when [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=243.2s)]
*  you could afford them back in their day. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=246.56s)]
*  And I'd like to take my ticket prices lower. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  But if I set my ticket prices low, these bots immediately eat them up and they resell [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=250.0s)]
*  for hundreds of dollars more. And I'm just making these bad actors rich. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think I'm not sure what this executive order is for, aside from what they've [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=258.36s)]
*  presented thus far. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=263.32s)]
*  Their presentation implies that this is an executive order to let Kid Rock do his own [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=265.64s)]
*  ticket prices for twelve dollars a pop. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=271.16s)]
*  Only seventy five obviously hasn't been to a concert in a while. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  First of all, yes, I have not. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=277.2s)]
*  But also, I said seventy five dollars because we're talking about Kid Rock. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=278.72s)]
*  OK, I know it's not exactly a Taylor Swift style ticket scheme. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  OK, his ticket prices should be not even free. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  He's ticket price. He should be paying to go listen to his dumbass music. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=291.68s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=295.56s)]
*  This is a big step to getting it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=296.92s)]
*  Step a lot of musicians. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  You could wear a jacket like that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. I was thinking about doing it for tomorrow. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=303.12s)]
*  We have a big event coming up and I was thinking about doing it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=309.2s)]
*  So you recently bought a Tesla for White House staff to use. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=310.0s)]
*  But now there's all these domestic terrorists targeting Tesla. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=314.24s)]
*  Are the staff scared to drive it? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=318.68s)]
*  I don't think so. I haven't heard they were complaining. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=321.12s)]
*  I did buy one and I let the staff use it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=323.36s)]
*  I we have it parked conveniently and one day we give it to Margo. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=326.12s)]
*  One day we give it to Chamberlain. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=331.0s)]
*  Give it to Natalie. We give it to everybody around and give it to Dan Scavino. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=333.0s)]
*  He's got so much money it doesn't matter. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  But they love the car and it's a great car. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  And it's made here and it's made in the country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=342.92s)]
*  It's got a tremendous plant now in Texas. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  And he had one and he has one in California. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of his work here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=350.44s)]
*  And he's been really unfairly treated, in my opinion. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  I travel. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=355.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=356.8s)]
*  There's this other story. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  I know it's hypothetical right now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=358.72s)]
*  But if you were allowed for some reason to run for a third term, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  is there a thought that the Democrats could try to run Barack Obama against you? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=364.56s)]
*  I'd love that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=369.68s)]
*  Or his third term? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=370.32s)]
*  Oh, I'd love that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=371.12s)]
*  That would that would be a good one. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=372.08s)]
*  I'd like that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=373.56s)]
*  And no, people are asking me to run. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=374.64s)]
*  And there's a whole story about running for a third term. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I never looked into it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=379.47999999999996s)]
*  They do say there's a way you can do it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=382.44s)]
*  But I don't know about that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=384.32s)]
*  But I have not looked into it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=385.56s)]
*  I want to do a fantastic job. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  We have four years, just about almost close to four years. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=388.84s)]
*  Time is flying, but it's still close to four years. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  And we're getting a lot of credit for having done a great job in the first almost 100 days. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  And we have some big things we're going to be announcing over the next two days. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=401.88s)]
*  You know very well, Peter. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  And I think it's going to be something that's going to bring a lot of wealth back to our country, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  tremendous wealth back to our country, actually. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  And other countries are understanding it because they've been ripping us for 50 years longer. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  But they've been ripping us off for years right from the beginning. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=419.64s)]
*  And I think this is going to be an amazing, you know, I call it a lot of different names, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=422.16s)]
*  but it's really in a sense, it's a rebirth of a country because what how we could have afforded to do what we did. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=429.12s)]
*  We help everybody and they don't help us. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=435.72s)]
*  I really the term I like best probably is the liberation of America. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=439.24s)]
*  It's a liberation of this country because it's incredible. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=443.24s)]
*  Look, we have 36 trillion in debt for a reason and that accumulates over a long period of time. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=447.76000000000005s)]
*  So I think what you're going to be seeing over the next couple of days will be very inspiring to a lot of people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=453.56s)]
*  You know, they had a lot of auto plants being built in a certain country. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=459.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to mention the country because we get along great with the country, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=464.68s)]
*  but those plants aren't being built there anymore. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=467.32000000000005s)]
*  They gave them up today and yesterday, day before. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=469.12s)]
*  And they're building them all now in the United States. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=472.88000000000005s)]
*  And we have many examples, not only auto plants, chip companies from Taiwan are coming in. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=475.8s)]
*  The biggest Mr. Wei, he's big. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=481.8s)]
*  I said, you are a smart guy, aren't you? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=484.56s)]
*  I've been reading about him over the years, but he controls a large portion of the chip businesses. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=486.52s)]
*  You know, you don't get smarter. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  They're going to be investing two or three hundred billion dollars. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=494.03999999999996s)]
*  Apple's investing five hundred billion dollars. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, they always built their places in China. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=499.8s)]
*  Now he's building here. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=501.68s)]
*  He is very... [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  He's doing the same thing that Elon Musk did to tremendous success. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=504.2s)]
*  Just keep lying about shit that's going to get better over and over again. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=509.64s)]
*  And by the time people go, hey, remember those things that you said were going to happen and haven't happened yet? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=515.2s)]
*  Just lie about the new thing and then recenter people's attentions onto the new things that are not going to happen. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=519.84s)]
*  If we've ever been at a trillion dollars... [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=524.96s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=526.76s)]
*  We're five... [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  Five hundred... [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=529.0s)]
*  What do I mean by a trillion? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  Five trillion, what are you referring to, sir? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=531.68s)]
*  I think that we're going to be at five trillion dollars of investment. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  I think you're going to have investments very shortly. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  Fuck it, dude. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to get seven quintrillion. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=541.7199999999999s)]
*  I made up the new number. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=544.8s)]
*  No one's ever seen numbers like this before. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=547.28s)]
*  It's quintrillion. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=551.0s)]
*  Quintuple billion. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=552.64s)]
*  New numbers. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=554.56s)]
*  Bigger numbers than anyone has ever seen. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=555.64s)]
*  But to me, the whole tariff situation. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=558.48s)]
*  And essentially, they've done that to us for many years. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=561.32s)]
*  We're anywhere near five trillion in two months. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  This could be numbers like the country's never seen. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=566.6s)]
*  And every time you hear a dollar spent, that's another job because the jobs are coming with it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=569.0s)]
*  So auto plants, chip plants, pharmaceuticals, lumber coming in. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=574.44s)]
*  We have things happening in this country. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=580.96s)]
*  I don't think... [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=583.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure that they've ever seen it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=584.48s)]
*  Steel. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=586.16s)]
*  You know, we have tariffs on steel. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=586.96s)]
*  They've been here for a while. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=588.72s)]
*  Steel and aluminum. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=590.92s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like we're witnessing now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=594.16s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=596.92s)]
*  Most of you agree with that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=598.6s)]
*  I mean, it's nothing much you can't agree with. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=599.6s)]
*  We have things happening in terms of jobs and investment, the likes of which I don't think we've ever seen. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=603.32s)]
*  If you look at, let's say, four to five trillion dollars in a period of a month and a half, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=609.8s)]
*  that's even more than you do with your concerts, which are always sold out, right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=616.0s)]
*  But nobody's ever seen numbers. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=619.76s)]
*  And think of it where Apple's at 500 billion. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=622.24s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen numbers. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=624.96s)]
*  But they always used to spend that money in China. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  Now they're spending it here. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  That means you're going to build... [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=631.12s)]
*  They don't have any tariffs. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  Remember, there are no tariffs if you do your product here, if you build whatever it is in the USA. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  One of the things we're also trying to get is if you buy a car that was built in the USA... [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  You've never seen a number? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=646.8s)]
*  I haven't. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=647.8s)]
*  No one has ever seen a number. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=648.8s)]
*  What is math? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=649.8s)]
*  It's illegal now. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=650.8s)]
*  It was built in the USA. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=651.8s)]
*  Never been done before. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=653.8s)]
*  It's a big deduction for people that really aren't used to deductions, frankly, because [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=656.0s)]
*  people that buy cars like that are not big into the world of deductions. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=661.52s)]
*  And now they're going to learn about deductions. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=665.56s)]
*  So I think it's going to be great. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=667.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=668.52s)]
*  Are you going to move in with the universal tariff or different individual tariff rates [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=670.24s)]
*  on a whole variety of different... [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=673.92s)]
*  Well, you're going to see in two days, which is maybe tomorrow night or probably Wednesday, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=674.92s)]
*  you're going to see. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=681.48s)]
*  And they're reciprocal. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=682.48s)]
*  So whatever they charge us, we charge them. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=684.64s)]
*  But we're being nicer than they were. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=686.96s)]
*  We have a lot of countries, friend and foe. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=689.12s)]
*  I always say friend and foe, but the friend in many cases is worse than the foe. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=691.16s)]
*  They took advantage of us. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=695.92s)]
*  And we are going to be very nice by comparison to what they were. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=698.12s)]
*  The numbers will be lower than what they've been charging us. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  And in some cases, maybe substantially lower, but we sort of have a world obligation, perhaps. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=706.32s)]
*  But we're going to be very nice. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=712.24s)]
*  Relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, you know that the chairman... [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=716.0s)]
*  Somebody said that about me the other day. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=718.5200000000001s)]
*  He said, who doesn't know me very well? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=720.24s)]
*  They said, you're such a kind person. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=723.08s)]
*  And I said, say that again. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=726.52s)]
*  They said, you're a kind person. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=728.4s)]
*  I said, I've never heard that before. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=730.8s)]
*  Even he couldn't believe it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=732.16s)]
*  He's like, say that again. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=733.0s)]
*  I've heard of words that... [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=734.84s)]
*  I don't know, I better not tell you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=736.12s)]
*  You know, I've heard of... [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=737.6s)]
*  Even Trump couldn't believe it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=738.8s)]
*  That someone was dumb enough to say he's a kind person. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=740.6s)]
*  Mr. President, you met with the chairman of Stellantis today. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=744.48s)]
*  Did he ask you for a pause on the auto tariffs? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=747.24s)]
*  No. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=750.2s)]
*  What was that meeting about? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=751.24s)]
*  Just about some of the problems they have with the environmental, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=752.9200000000001s)]
*  which we're going to clean up. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=756.2s)]
*  Have any of you automated? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=757.4s)]
*  We're going to probably go back to 1920s. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=758.2800000000001s)]
*  If you look, we're going to go back probably to a 2020 standard. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=760.96s)]
*  So we'll have 2020 standard. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=766.12s)]
*  And that's just a few years ago. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, they're putting them... [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  They're making it so difficult. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=771.88s)]
*  All over the world, they're making it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't mean a damn bit of difference, either, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=774.2800000000001s)]
*  for the environment. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=776.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=776.9200000000001s)]
*  They make it impossible for people to build cars. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=778.96s)]
*  So we're going to be doing much different. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=781.36s)]
*  2020 is a strong standard, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=783.08s)]
*  but they've taken it to a level now that makes it very difficult to build a car. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=786.9200000000001s)]
*  So we're going to be bringing it back to a standard [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  that is a very good environmental standard, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=796.6800000000001s)]
*  but it makes it possible to build a car. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=799.36s)]
*  Have you heard any concerns from the automakers, though, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=801.24s)]
*  about the tariffs on parts that will go into effect over the coming weeks? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=803.1600000000001s)]
*  They all know. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=806.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, I gave them a big break for a month. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=808.08s)]
*  I didn't charge them anything. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=809.8800000000001s)]
*  For a big month, for that first month, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=811.36s)]
*  and they brought a lot of material into this country [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=813.24s)]
*  because they could bring it in without tariff. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=815.76s)]
*  If you look at Canada and Mexico, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  they were driving hundreds of thousands of cars into the market [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=821.0400000000001s)]
*  because they avoid the tariffs by doing it before the tariffs go on, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=825.6s)]
*  which would be Wednesday. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=828.6800000000001s)]
*  And I looked at some of your shows [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=830.5200000000001s)]
*  where cars are lined up for miles and miles. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=834.12s)]
*  Some of them didn't have fenders on them. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=837.48s)]
*  Some of them didn't have the roof on yet. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=839.3199999999999s)]
*  They're driving it in brand new. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=841.52s)]
*  They're driving it in because they want to avoid the tariffs. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  I let them have that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=845.36s)]
*  They sort of took advantage of it because, you know, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=846.72s)]
*  that wasn't part of the deal, but that's okay. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=849.48s)]
*  They're great American car companies and car companies. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=851.72s)]
*  And so I gave them a little break on that. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  Are there any countries that you're not targeting on that? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=858.68s)]
*  Well, it depends. You know, I said it's reciprocal. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=861.88s)]
*  Not everybody has made a fortune, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=864.4399999999999s)]
*  but almost everybody has, but not everybody. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=867.8s)]
*  And the ones that haven't, we're going to be very nice to them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=870.36s)]
*  And on a separate issue. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=875.0s)]
*  Because that word reciprocal is very important. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=876.12s)]
*  What they do to us, we do to them. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=878.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=882.16s)]
*  I just ask you briefly, on President Putin, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=883.28s)]
*  you said over the weekend or indicated over the weekend [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=884.88s)]
*  some frustration with him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=887.12s)]
*  How serious are you about imposing oil sanctions on Russia? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=888.6s)]
*  No, I want to see him make a deal so that we stop Russian soldiers [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=891.0s)]
*  and Ukrainian soldiers and other people from being killed. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=895.92s)]
*  But mostly it's Russian and Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=900.04s)]
*  They're losing at least 2,500 human beings, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=902.88s)]
*  beautiful human beings a week. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=907.16s)]
*  And I wanted to stop. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=910.04s)]
*  And some people would say, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  why are you worried about Russian soldiers [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=913.52s)]
*  or Ukrainian soldiers? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=915.28s)]
*  I worry because it's like they're just like you people. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=916.4s)]
*  They're like us. They're like all of us. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=918.68s)]
*  And I seem to have an ability to do those things. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=921.16s)]
*  And if I can do that, I think it's a very worthwhile thing to do. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=924.48s)]
*  And I think we will. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=929.8000000000001s)]
*  No, I want to make sure that he follows through. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=931.24s)]
*  And I think he will. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=934.6s)]
*  I don't want to go secondary tariffs on his oil. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=935.44s)]
*  But I think, you know, it's something I would do [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=937.6400000000001s)]
*  if I thought he wasn't doing the job. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=940.24s)]
*  I did it with Venezuela, secondary tariffs. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=941.8800000000001s)]
*  And you know what happened? Every boat left the harbor. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=944.7600000000001s)]
*  Did you see that? It was a beautiful thing to see. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=946.84s)]
*  The whole harbor emptied out. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=949.5200000000001s)]
*  My words weren't even finished. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=952.2800000000001s)]
*  And I have these massive, these massive shifts. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=953.72s)]
*  They're actually taking the hoses and dumping them into there. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=957.0400000000001s)]
*  They couldn't get out of there fast enough [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=959.76s)]
*  because they know I don't play games. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=962.0s)]
*  So I think he's going to live up to what he told me. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=963.84s)]
*  And I think he's going to fulfill his part of the deal. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=966.48s)]
*  Now, then you have Zelensky, and hopefully he's going to live up. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=972.36s)]
*  I see he's trying to renegotiate the rare earth. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=975.44s)]
*  You know, we did something because, as you know, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=978.64s)]
*  the Europeans get paid back the money that they gave. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=981.08s)]
*  We don't because Biden is an incompetent president. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=983.24s)]
*  And he should have asked for a rare earth [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=987.48s)]
*  or he should have asked for the loans [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=989.24s)]
*  to be guaranteed in some form. That's what Europe did. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  Europe is in for 100, probably $100 billion. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=993.4s)]
*  And we're in for 350 billion. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=998.36s)]
*  So we're in for more than three times. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1000.36s)]
*  And now you could make it a little bit less than that, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1002.52s)]
*  but it doesn't matter. Whatever the number. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1004.84s)]
*  We're in for substantially more than Europe. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1006.08s)]
*  We could be in for 350 billion. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1007.72s)]
*  They have no idea because Biden wasn't a good bookkeeper [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1010.12s)]
*  except for himself. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1013.64s)]
*  And what happens is we made a deal for rare earth. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1015.24s)]
*  It was all done. And I heard through you. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1019.08s)]
*  I haven't spoken to them yet, but through you, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1022.0400000000001s)]
*  I heard that they're now saying, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1023.88s)]
*  Well, I'll only do that deal if we get into NATO [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1025.48s)]
*  or something to that effect. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1028.44s)]
*  Well, that was never number one discussed. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1030.4s)]
*  Number two, I think it's going to be very long before Putin. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1032.68s)]
*  They said, You're not going into NATO. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1035.68s)]
*  And it could be that's probably the reason [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1037.68s)]
*  the war started, actually. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1040.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1041.92s)]
*  Hours away from a very special election, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1042.52s)]
*  Wisconsin, Florida, I want to share your thoughts [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1046.1200000000001s)]
*  on Republican voters to not sleep on this. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1047.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1050.5600000000002s)]
*  Very important race to gather. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1050.92s)]
*  Well, it's a big race, Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1052.2s)]
*  It's taking place essentially as we as you know, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1057.0s)]
*  it was early voting. So we'll see what happens. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1061.44s)]
*  It's a big race. I love Wisconsin. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1063.5600000000002s)]
*  We won Wisconsin. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1066.56s)]
*  Republicans typically don't do very well in Wisconsin, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1068.28s)]
*  but I did. I actually won it twice. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1071.04s)]
*  I actually probably won it three times to be exact. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1073.96s)]
*  We played there. Not probably. I won it three times. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  We had a rigged election the second time, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1079.84s)]
*  but that's one of those things. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1081.6399999999999s)]
*  We had to make this one too big to rig. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1083.44s)]
*  Would you agree with that, Brian? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1085.84s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1086.9199999999998s)]
*  My dad triggered the fire alarm. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1089.2s)]
*  So anyway, but yeah, it is a big race. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1093.3999999999999s)]
*  And I hope you get out and vote for the republic. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1095.92s)]
*  The woman is a radical left lunatic. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  And let's see who wins. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1100.8000000000002s)]
*  But the woman will be very bad. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1102.72s)]
*  And you know, Wisconsin is a big state politically. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1105.5600000000002s)]
*  And the Supreme Court has a lot to do with elections [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1108.76s)]
*  in Wisconsin. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  So if whoever it is that's running, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1111.92s)]
*  including, you know, even Senate races, et cetera, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1115.96s)]
*  but whoever it is in four years that runs, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1118.3600000000001s)]
*  having Wisconsin is a very big, you know, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1121.28s)]
*  we want it early and big. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1123.5600000000002s)]
*  But winning Wisconsin is a big deal. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1125.6399999999999s)]
*  So therefore, the Supreme Court choice, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1127.36s)]
*  this is the one you're talking about right now. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1130.4399999999998s)]
*  It's a big race. It's going to be announced fairly shortly. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1134.04s)]
*  President Trump, on TikTok, big week deadlines. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1138.0s)]
*  You got Liberation Day and the TikTok deadline. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1141.6s)]
*  Yeah, we do, which I can extend if I want. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1143.9199999999998s)]
*  But we have a lot of enthusiasm for TikTok for buying it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1146.84s)]
*  I think TikTok is good. I've used it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1150.76s)]
*  Remember the ban? What happened? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1152.6s)]
*  It was supposed to be banned by now. What happened? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1154.08s)]
*  And we won by 36 points. The youth. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1156.32s)]
*  You know, we won the youth, which Republicans don't do. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1159.0s)]
*  Maybe it's because Kid Rock likes Trump. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1162.68s)]
*  I don't know. But we won the youth by 36 points. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1164.6s)]
*  And I attribute some of that to TikTok. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1168.84s)]
*  Is the TikTok deal, the negotiations now, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1171.92s)]
*  tied to a bigger tariff deal with China? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1175.04s)]
*  No, but you know, it could be. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1178.04s)]
*  I mean, you know I've used tariffs [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1179.72s)]
*  for lots of different reasons. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1181.6399999999999s)]
*  But I could see, you know, one point in tariffs with China, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1182.96s)]
*  big country, would be probably worth more [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  than all of TikTok is valuable as TikTok is, it's big stuff. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1189.28s)]
*  So there's a great example. That's a great question, actually. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1193.44s)]
*  I'm a very flexible person. I could use that for that. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1197.3200000000002s)]
*  Maybe I'll take a couple of points off [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1200.64s)]
*  if I get approvals for something. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1202.1200000000001s)]
*  I haven't done it. Maybe I'll do it. Maybe I won't. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1204.4s)]
*  But it's a very good question. Peter, you're very good. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1207.8400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. You'll love this one. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1210.84s)]
*  Go ahead. I can imagine. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1212.8s)]
*  What is your thought about Tiger Woods [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1214.8s)]
*  now becoming part of the broader Trump family? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1216.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. Well, I love Tiger. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1219.8s)]
*  And I love Vanessa. And they had a great relationship. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1222.08s)]
*  I happen to think the relationship with my son, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1227.12s)]
*  I think I happen to think the relationship was hurt [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1230.72s)]
*  very badly by the witch hunt that went on Russia, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1233.04s)]
*  Russia, Russia, and all the crap that they put Don through. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1235.1999999999998s)]
*  Who knew nothing about it? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1238.1599999999999s)]
*  But Vanessa and Don had a very good relationship. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1240.04s)]
*  They have incredible children, five incredible children. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1242.56s)]
*  All good athletes, all great students. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1247.16s)]
*  They're like great. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1248.96s)]
*  And they broke up, you know, quite a while ago. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1250.36s)]
*  And which was to me very sad because I think they're both great. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1254.04s)]
*  Don and Vanessa and Tiger actually called me [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1258.16s)]
*  a few months ago and he and they have a very special, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1261.12s)]
*  very good relationship with Tiger. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1264.8s)]
*  I played golf with him a couple of times over the last month. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1266.32s)]
*  And he's a fantastic guy and a fantastic athlete. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1269.52s)]
*  And he told me about it. And I said, Tiger, that's good. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1272.08s)]
*  That's good. I'm very happy for both. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1276.16s)]
*  I just let them both be happy. Let them both be happy. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1279.0s)]
*  They're both great. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1282.48s)]
*  To follow up on China, China, South Korea, and Japan [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1284.08s)]
*  say they're going to work together in cooperation [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1288.64s)]
*  to respond to the tariffs that you're going to put [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1291.16s)]
*  to effect this week. Are you concerned that ... [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1292.92s)]
*  If only Shinzo Abe were here, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1295.28s)]
*  he would never let this happen. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1297.24s)]
*  He would never align with China. I miss him so much. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1300.32s)]
*  I'm not worried about it. Yeah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1303.7199999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, can I ask you about something? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1304.84s)]
*  I think they have a chance of doing better, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1305.9599999999998s)]
*  actually, with the tariffs. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1307.8s)]
*  It can actually help them in a certain way. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1308.8s)]
*  And I think a lot of them will drop their tariffs [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1311.1599999999999s)]
*  because, you know, they've been unfairly tariffing [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1313.1599999999999s)]
*  the United States for years. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1316.6799999999998s)]
*  And if you look at the European Union on cars, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1318.04s)]
*  the European Union already dropped their tariff [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1321.6399999999999s)]
*  down to two and a half percent. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1323.7199999999998s)]
*  It was announced a couple of days ago, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1324.84s)]
*  which is what the United ... [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1327.48s)]
*  which is a very small tariff. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1329.2s)]
*  The United States charged very little. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  And a lot of ... [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1334.52s)]
*  I think I heard that India, just a little while ago, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1336.3600000000001s)]
*  is going to be dropping its tariffs very substantially. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  And I said, why didn't somebody do this a long time ago? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  A lot of countries are going to be dropping their tariffs. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1344.0s)]
*  The question that happened in France today, Mr. President, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1346.5600000000002s)]
*  Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1349.72s)]

*  and is now banned from running for office for five years. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1353.28s)]
*  Do you have a comment? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1356.36s)]
*  The President's answer is, big deal. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1357.2s)]
*  That's a very big deal. I know all about it. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1359.1599999999999s)]
*  And a lot of people thought she wasn't going to be [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1361.56s)]
*  convicted of anything. And I don't know if it means conviction, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1363.84s)]
*  but she was banned for running for five years, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  and she's the leading candidate. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1368.56s)]
*  That sounds like this country. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1370.56s)]

*  So, you know, a lot of bad things happen. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1486.52s)]
*  But we're always, you know, we'll never, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1488.96s)]
*  until we find out something definitive one way or the other, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1491.96s)]
*  we'll never stop looking for him. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1494.6s)]
*  But we have been. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1496.6s)]
*  And the response, it's just a lot of dead ends. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1498.0s)]
*  He's been gone for a long time. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1503.44s)]
*  The problem is there's never been a sighting. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1504.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, sometimes you'll have somebody you're looking for [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1506.9199999999998s)]
*  and there's a sighting. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1508.9199999999998s)]
*  There's never been a sighting of Austin. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1510.56s)]
*  But we are out there and we have great respect for his family [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1513.76s)]
*  and for his mother. She's been unbelievable. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1517.2s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1519.48s)]
*  The question about... [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1520.1599999999999s)]
*  No, behind you. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1521.12s)]
*  No, apologies. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1521.76s)]
*  You've had outreach with the leaders of Russia and China. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1522.36s)]
*  You've made an outreach to Iran. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1526.28s)]
*  When are you going to plan to reach out to North Korea [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1528.72s)]
*  and Kim Jong-un anytime in the near future? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1532.04s)]
*  Well, I do. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1534.1599999999999s)]
*  I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1534.8s)]
*  Now, you people hate to hear that, but it's very important. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1539.12s)]
*  I got along with him fantastically, as you know. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1542.84s)]
*  It started off very rough, very nasty. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1545.08s)]
*  Little rocket man. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  The whole thing was a nasty deal. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1550.0s)]
*  And then one day we got a call that they'd like to meet. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1552.3600000000001s)]
*  We met. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1554.76s)]
*  We have a great relationship. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1555.88s)]
*  And yeah, we have... [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1558.3600000000001s)]
*  There is communication. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1562.2s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1564.76s)]
*  You know, he's a big nuclear nation. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1566.3600000000001s)]
*  And he's a very smart guy. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1569.48s)]
*  I got to know him very well. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1572.4s)]
*  I remember I put my foot across the line [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1574.4s)]
*  and then I walked across the line. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1577.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if Secret Service was thrilled with that. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1579.08s)]
*  They actually wasn't. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1581.6399999999999s)]
*  They were not too thrilled. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1582.6799999999998s)]
*  But I have a very good relationship with him. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I will probably do something at some point. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1588.08s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1590.96s)]
*  Who's on your short list, Mr. President, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1592.12s)]
*  to replace Lisa Sopcich as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1593.76s)]
*  So we have a lot of good people that want it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1598.1599999999999s)]
*  First of all, Lisa's fantastic. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1601.52s)]
*  And I just don't want to take chances where you guys think, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1603.12s)]
*  how is the election going? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1605.6s)]
*  We have a congressional election that's a little bit close. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1606.8799999999999s)]
*  I guess the one is in good shape, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1610.36s)]
*  but the other one's a little bit close. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1612.08s)]
*  But Randy Fine is a great guy. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1614.08s)]
*  They're both good candidates. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  They're very good. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1618.28s)]
*  But it's, you know, a little bit... [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1618.84s)]
*  We want to be careful. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1621.72s)]
*  And Lisa's very popular in her district. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1623.1999999999998s)]
*  And so am I. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1626.28s)]
*  We won by a lot of points, and so did she. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1626.8799999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that wanted to run for it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1630.52s)]
*  But we have no idea, are they going to win? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1633.1999999999998s)]
*  I think, Elise, what about going back? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1635.52s)]
*  Because they love you there, and she's [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1638.24s)]
*  going to take a big leadership position with Mike Johnson [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1640.52s)]
*  and the group, the Speaker. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1643.76s)]
*  And I can tell you that for the replacement, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1646.0s)]
*  we have a lot of people that have asked about it [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1651.36s)]
*  and would like to do it. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1653.3999999999999s)]
*  David Friedman, Rick Grinnell, and maybe 30 other people. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1654.32s)]
*  Everyone loves that position. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1661.8799999999999s)]
*  That's a star-making position. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1663.48s)]
*  And so we'll see what happens. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1665.8400000000001s)]
*  But we have a lot of people that are [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1667.56s)]
*  interested in going to the United Nations, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1669.24s)]
*  as you can imagine. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1672.1200000000001s)]
*  So a quick music question. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1672.6200000000001s)]
*  Favorite song to play live is what? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1674.88s)]
*  And then my question for you, Mr. President. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1676.64s)]
*  This is a favorite rally you did last year, 2024. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1678.68s)]
*  What was your favorite one? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1682.04s)]
*  Favorite song to play live? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1683.52s)]
*  We're in Modi territory. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1685.0s)]
*  Tough one. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1686.3200000000002s)]
*  It'd have to be one of the hits, probably [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1690.8s)]
*  Cowboy or Ball with the Bar. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1692.68s)]
*  There's a song that I played every night that [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  was never a singular hit that I probably should not [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1698.16s)]
*  say the words to in this office right now. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1700.28s)]
*  I think for you, Mr. President. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  You never met a certain person like me. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1704.48s)]
*  By the way, his rallies are amazing. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1705.68s)]
*  He does great and gets big crowds. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1707.24s)]
*  He's really a star when it comes to that. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1709.88s)]
*  He is a very talented guy. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1713.8400000000001s)]
*  I would say he's been standing there the whole time. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1717.2s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1720.48s)]
*  That was there. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1721.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1722.8799999999999s)]
*  Kid, Leroy has been standing there the entire time. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1723.52s)]
*  You know, to me, it's always been. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1726.44s)]
*  I'm losing it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1727.84s)]
*  He said this. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1729.1599999999999s)]
*  He's never seen anything like it. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1730.04s)]
*  We had, when you announced Madison Square Garden, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1731.36s)]
*  you know, it's a big arena. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1734.72s)]
*  But we sell out big arenas. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1735.8s)]
*  We sold out in Milwaukee. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1737.2s)]
*  We sold out at every big arena. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1738.36s)]
*  We don't have, we never had empty seats. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1739.9199999999998s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1741.52s)]
*  They talk about Bernie Sanders gets to 3,000 people. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1742.3999999999999s)]
*  I've heard that. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1744.96s)]
*  These crowds, I get 107,000 people in New Jersey. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1745.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, we've heard the crowds. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1749.2s)]
*  In Buckram, PA, we had over 100,000 the second time. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1750.8s)]
*  We had 55,000 the first time. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1754.6s)]
*  We have these crowds. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1756.4s)]
*  Oh, he's heard the crowds. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1757.24s)]
*  I would say Madison Square Garden. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1758.08s)]
*  He's seen the Bernie crowds. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1758.92s)]
*  He does not like that. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1759.76s)]
*  I grew up in New York. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1760.6s)]
*  Kid did the rock, but to be like, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1762.44s)]
*  oh, my favorite line is when I said, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1764.08s)]
*  in my famous song, you call it statutory, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1766.96s)]
*  I call it mandatory. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1770.68s)]
*  That's his favorite line. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1771.96s)]
*  It was stacked all the way back to the Hudson River [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1773.0s)]
*  and on the other direction, back to Fifth Avenue. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1775.24s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1778.16s)]
*  I don't mean with a line. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1779.0s)]
*  I mean like 50 deep, like 50 deep this way. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1780.16s)]
*  The streets were closed, the whole thing. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1784.96s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1786.6000000000001s)]
*  And when you take that, you know, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1787.96s)]
*  you want to do well at Madison Square Garden. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1789.16s)]
*  You don't want to have empty seats, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1790.92s)]
*  but we could have sold it out Brian 10 times [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1793.44s)]
*  and everybody knew it. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1795.64s)]
*  And I think we got a good indication [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1796.5600000000002s)]
*  that that's where the election was going. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1798.8000000000002s)]
*  And we won every swing state [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1800.64s)]
*  and we won by millions of votes. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1802.0s)]
*  It was a great election. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1804.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1805.72s)]
*  Mr. President, the US military [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1806.5600000000002s)]
*  transferred 17 individuals to El Salvador overnight. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1807.56s)]
*  Did you discuss with your team [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1811.04s)]
*  whether these deportations would run afoul [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1812.48s)]
*  of any recent court orders? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1814.96s)]
*  No, I do want to thank however, the president. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1816.8s)]
*  He has been unbelievable and you know, in relation to us, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1820.2s)]
*  but I think that our people have done an incredible job. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1826.28s)]
*  You know, I got elected on the basis [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1830.28s)]
*  of getting bad people out of our country [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1831.96s)]
*  that shouldn't be here. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1833.72s)]
*  Very dangerous people out of our country. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1835.12s)]
*  And that's what I did. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1838.28s)]
*  And then you have a judge that wants to take over [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1839.28s)]
*  and I can't imagine it can be allowed. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1841.72s)]
*  If it was up to him, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1844.32s)]
*  they'd all be put back in our country. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1845.1599999999999s)]
*  These are killers. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1846.56s)]
*  These are drug lords. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1847.76s)]
*  These are really bad people. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1848.9199999999998s)]
*  But I want to thank the president of El Salvador [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1850.8799999999999s)]
*  because he's done an amazing job. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1853.6s)]
*  You saw it. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1857.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1858.32s)]
*  Elon Musk's special government tenure [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1859.32s)]
*  is coming to an end in 130 days, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1861.56s)]
*  I think another month. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1863.48s)]
*  Do you want him to stay longer [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1865.3200000000002s)]
*  or is it time for him to go back [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1866.92s)]
*  to running his companies in your country? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1868.48s)]
*  Well, I think he's amazing, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1869.3200000000002s)]
*  but I also think he's got a big company to run. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1871.0s)]
*  And so at some point he's going to be going back. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1873.3200000000002s)]
*  He wants to. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1875.2s)]
*  Do you want to keep him around? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1876.04s)]
*  But, oh, I keep him as long as I can keep him. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1877.3600000000001s)]
*  He's a very talented guy. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1880.04s)]
*  You know, I love very smart people. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1882.2s)]
*  He's very smart and he's done a good job. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1884.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, Doge is, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1886.6000000000001s)]
*  we found numbers that nobody can even believe, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1889.1200000000001s)]
*  like 400 billion, 500 billion. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1894.24s)]
*  It could be close to a trillion dollars by the time they end. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1897.6000000000001s)]
*  Nobody knows numbers I've never even seen before. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1900.5600000000002s)]
*  Who knows numbers? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1903.64s)]
*  And he's led the charge. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1904.48s)]
*  And you've seen a lot of his people. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1905.5200000000002s)]
*  And these are people that joined up. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1907.0800000000002s)]
*  I always say they're high IQ people. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1909.0800000000002s)]
*  I like high IQ people. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1910.8400000000001s)]
*  And they've done a great job. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1912.68s)]
*  No, at some point, Elon's going to, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1914.64s)]
*  I will say he's got, despite the way he's been treated. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1916.32s)]
*  So he's an American patriot, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1920.28s)]
*  but the way he's been treated with Tesla is just terrible. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1922.36s)]
*  It's just terrible. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1926.0s)]
*  In fact, you have a Tesla. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1926.84s)]
*  And you love it. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1929.0s)]
*  You love it. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1931.08s)]
*  He was saying before he bought a Tesla, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1931.92s)]
*  he loved it. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1933.2s)]
*  A lot of people are buying Teslas, I think. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1934.04s)]
*  And I hope they are. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1936.12s)]
*  He should not be treated that way. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1937.0s)]
*  He's done an incredible service to our country. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1938.44s)]
*  Well, once he goes back, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1941.2s)]
*  is Doge going to keep operating even without Elon here? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1942.04s)]
*  Well, I can't tell you that. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1944.68s)]
*  I can say this, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1945.8s)]
*  that a lot of the people that are working with Doge [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1946.8799999999999s)]
*  are the secretaries, the heads of the various agencies. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1949.24s)]
*  And they've learned a lot. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1953.04s)]
*  And they're dealing with the Doge people. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1954.72s)]
*  I think some of them may try [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1956.8s)]
*  and keep the Doge people with them. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1958.08s)]
*  But on a certain point, I think it will end. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1960.24s)]
*  But they have also gotten a big education [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1963.2s)]
*  and they're doing a really good job. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1965.68s)]
*  There'll be a point at which the secretaries [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1967.8s)]
*  will be able to do this work and do it very, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1969.52s)]
*  you know, as we say, with the scalpel. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1973.64s)]
*  And that's what we want. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1976.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Jeff. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1977.0800000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, have you had any updates [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1977.92s)]
*  on the U.S. soldiers missing in Lithuania? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1979.3600000000001s)]
*  I have. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1981.8000000000002s)]
*  Can you give us an update? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1982.72s)]
*  So three are no longer with us. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1984.1200000000001s)]
*  And one is unfortunately probably in the same category, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1987.88s)]
*  but they haven't declared that yet. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1993.16s)]
*  It was a very heavy truck, like a toy, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1995.24s)]
*  but I mean, really heavy. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1997.44s)]
*  They lifted the heaviest equipment. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=1999.0s)]
*  It would seem that the bank of a lake collapsed. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2001.96s)]
*  You know, the weight is so big. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2005.48s)]
*  And it was at night and it was very cold weather, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2007.04s)]
*  nice, a lot of ice. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2009.28s)]
*  And it's possibly slipped [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2011.56s)]
*  and the weight is so enormous of this thing. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2013.52s)]
*  It's a massively heavy vehicle. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2015.28s)]
*  And if they slipped a little bit, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2020.76s)]
*  that's probably what happened and it flipped. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2022.08s)]
*  And three are gone. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2025.8799999999999s)]
*  And one is missing. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2030.72s)]
*  On a separate topic, a follow-up on immigration. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2032.96s)]
*  Did you see the video of a Tufts University student [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2035.3600000000001s)]
*  who was taken off the street by ICE agents last week [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2038.88s)]
*  in hoodies and masks? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2042.1200000000001s)]
*  There's been a lot of criticism of that. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2044.56s)]
*  Are you comfortable with how that was handled? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2046.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, I haven't really looked at it in any detail, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2047.84s)]
*  but I will. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2050.48s)]
*  I mean, I have seen it quickly, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2051.32s)]
*  but I wouldn't want to comment on it. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2052.8s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2055.12s)]
*  Yeah, Mr. President, would you be able to confirm [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2055.96s)]
*  a recent reporting that you are making plans [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2058.28s)]
*  to go to Saudi Arabia next month? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2060.6800000000003s)]
*  And if so, why is Saudi Arabia so important? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2062.84s)]
*  So I have a very good relationship with the Middle East. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2065.6400000000003s)]
*  In fact, if you look at Michigan, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2070.0s)]
*  I won the vote by a lot. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2071.48s)]
*  People were a little surprised. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2073.2000000000003s)]
*  And I have a very good relationship with Mohammed [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2075.1200000000003s)]
*  and the King. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2079.28s)]
*  His son is Mohammed. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2080.1200000000003s)]
*  He's great. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2081.2000000000003s)]
*  Crown Prince, actually, he's Prime Minister too. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2082.0400000000004s)]
*  He's got a lot of good titles. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2084.88s)]
*  But he's great. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2086.96s)]
*  And the King has been wonderful. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2088.64s)]
*  And if you remember, last time I went to Saudi Arabia, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2091.12s)]
*  I put a person on the list because they agreed [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2093.8s)]
*  to buy $450 billion worth of American goods, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2096.56s)]
*  military and otherwise. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2102.12s)]
*  And they did. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2104.32s)]
*  And it was an unbelievable day. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2105.16s)]
*  It was in this gorgeous ballroom. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2106.8s)]
*  And companies were there from many, many, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2108.64s)]
*  probably 100 companies. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2112.44s)]
*  They were given anywhere from $40 or $50 million [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2114.08s)]
*  to less and more, actually. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2117.6s)]
*  In case some of them were given numbers [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2122.6s)]
*  that were just many times that amount. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2124.6s)]
*  I think we had a couple of $20 million deals, big stuff. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2126.96s)]
*  And it's a very rich country because of oil. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2131.64s)]
*  And we are a very rich country ultimately. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2134.6s)]
*  We're always trading up because of oil. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2137.16s)]
*  Oil is always good. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2139.8799999999997s)]
*  And I agreed to do it again. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2141.2s)]
*  And they've agreed to spend close to a trillion dollars [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2144.52s)]
*  of money in our American companies, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2148.0s)]
*  which to me means jobs. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2151.04s)]
*  So they're gonna spend hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2153.2s)]
*  giving them to American companies [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2158.3199999999997s)]
*  that are gonna be making equipment for Saudi Arabia [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2160.3599999999997s)]
*  and other places in the Middle East. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  And for that, I think it's worth it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2167.12s)]
*  I did it last time, $450 billion. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2168.96s)]
*  And the press was there. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2171.88s)]
*  It was one of the most unique days I've ever seen [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2172.88s)]
*  where companies would get up and you're getting $20 billion. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2176.88s)]
*  There's nothing funnier than Kid Diddler Rocks [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2180.56s)]
*  standing there for this entire process. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2182.52s)]
*  And he has to stand up the whole time. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2184.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you were there. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2185.76s)]
*  You might be too young for that. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2186.88s)]
*  I was on the Democratic campaign trail. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2188.52s)]
*  Who? It was boring. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2190.64s)]
*  This was a much better deal. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2191.96s)]
*  But it was amazing, actually. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2193.88s)]
*  It was an amazing day. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2195.96s)]
*  We sold and we partook in $450 billion worth of investment [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2197.32s)]
*  into American companies. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2204.0s)]
*  And they announced the company, the amount of money, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2205.36s)]
*  a billion dollars, $5 billion, $25 billion. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2208.1600000000003s)]
*  And the chairman of the company, many of whom, you know, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2211.84s)]
*  well-known figures, prestigious figures, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2215.04s)]
*  great business leaders, they went up, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2217.6000000000004s)]
*  they shook the hand of somebody, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2220.32s)]
*  and they would sit down. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2222.8s)]
*  And we just had a big investment made. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2224.2000000000003s)]
*  So it was a record. Nobody ever beat it before. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2226.44s)]
*  $450 billion worth of jobs. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2229.2400000000002s)]
*  I viewed his jobs more than anything else. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2232.2000000000003s)]
*  And now we're close to a trillion dollars. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2233.96s)]
*  So it's more than double the number that we did [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2236.48s)]
*  when I first came to office. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2240.08s)]
*  And this could take place next month? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2241.4s)]
*  It could be next month, maybe a little bit later, yeah. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2244.56s)]
*  And we're going to Qatar also. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2247.08s)]
*  We're going to possibly a couple of other countries. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2251.72s)]
*  UAE is very important. It's a great leader in UAE. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2256.48s)]
*  And I had his brother here the other night, if you saw that. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2261.52s)]
*  We had a wonderful guy, a wonderful family. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2264.3999999999996s)]
*  That's how you know the UAE is the worst. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2266.8799999999997s)]
*  So probably we'll stop at UAE and Qatar. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2267.96s)]
*  And as I used to call it, Qatar, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2269.96s)]
*  nobody's ever told me right or wrong. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2273.24s)]
*  I always like to say Qatar, but it's Qatar. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2275.52s)]
*  They like to say Qatar. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2278.64s)]
*  And Saudi Arabia, the three of them. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2280.2799999999997s)]
*  And then we'll go other places also. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2282.12s)]
*  But in the Middle East, I seem to be the three. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2284.56s)]
*  And again, tremendous amounts of jobs [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2286.9599999999996s)]
*  will be created in those two or three days. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2291.24s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2294.12s)]

*  Literally his own personal... [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2332.8399999999997s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2335.3199999999997s)]
*  News conferences like this, Peter? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2336.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't think... No. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2337.4799999999996s)]
*  Oh, we missed it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2339.44s)]
*  He said, did Biden do press conferences like this? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMjtF7JKJ6E&t=2341.08s)]
