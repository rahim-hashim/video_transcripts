# How Is The Israel-Palestine Hostage Exchange Unfolding? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU)
*  It's devastating. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=0.0s)]
*  But that is the reason why they did this release, the show of force, this show to basically say, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2.08s)]
*  look, the conditions that you claimed that these hostages were in is not the conditions that they [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=8.56s)]
*  were actually in. In all matter of death and devastation that they experienced came in the hands [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=14.24s)]
*  of Israeli b****** campaigns. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=19.76s)]
*  Alright, we are going to talk about the Gaza ceasefire and the four Israeli hostages freed by [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=21.92s)]
*  Hamas in swap for 200 Palestinian prisoners. Now hostages, these are for Israeli prisoners of war. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=31.44s)]
*  These are for Israeli soldiers. Okay. Make no mistake, Channel 4, albeit is one of the best [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=38.24s)]
*  western outlets out there in terms of communicating exactly what's going on in Gaza to the best of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=46.32s)]
*  their ability. Okay. And yet there's still a bar there while they clear that low bar, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=52.08s)]
*  it's still far from the appropriate way of talking about these issues. So [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  it's something you should understand. And the reason why it is especially important to recognize [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=65.6s)]
*  in this situation is because in order to, in order to combat that narrative, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=70.08s)]
*  Hamas this time around made them wear their IDF garb in their release. Okay. Now remember, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=77.84s)]
*  remember for the past 16 months, Israel has propagandized about both the understandable, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=87.36s)]
*  you know, the devastation of October 7 and the subsequent propaganda that consistently claimed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=95.36s)]
*  without any evidence whatsoever, mind you, that these Palestinians are all barbaric, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=105.2s)]
*  rapist monsters and that they had no political motivations and no interest in like emancipation [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=110.64s)]
*  whatsoever in any of their actions, but simply are operating on antisemitic tendencies and did [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=117.36s)]
*  this because they despise Jewish people and want to rape them, right? They kidnapped people, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=124.56s)]
*  not because they wanted a political bargaining chip, a leverage over the sovereign occupying [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=133.2s)]
*  nation that has dominated their existence with no means of emancipation whatsoever, no way out of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=141.44s)]
*  this horrifying process whatsoever in a concentration camp that is also known as [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=148.24s)]
*  Gaza, the world's largest open air prison, but instead for selfish, violent desires. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  So this initiative, the way that this release happened from Hamas' designs here was to combat [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  that misinformation, to showcase that one, to the best of their limited abilities under a ruthless [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=175.36s)]
*  and brutal blockade and consistent bombing, that international organs of justice and humanitarian [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=183.68s)]
*  groups, including Israeli humanitarian groups have called a j**tide, militants tasked with Palestinian [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=191.52s)]
*  emancipation and the resistance against the Israeli apartheid and Israeli j**tide were able to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=198.0s)]
*  successfully secure the well-being, to the best of their abilities, of the prisoners that they had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=204.0s)]
*  taken. This completely undermines the Israeli narrative. If you recall, there was a lot of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=209.76s)]
*  back and forth in Israeli media talking about how these girls are being l**ked every day, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=218.16s)]
*  they're pregnant, they fear for the worse. There was no evidence for this whatsoever, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=227.76s)]
*  not to say that this would never happen. I'm not saying that at all. As I've maintained throughout [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=233.12s)]
*  my coverage of October 7 and as I've talked about consistently even in other instances, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=239.76s)]
*  sexual violence and sexual assault is all too common in the field of battle. It happens all [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=248.24s)]
*  the time. So there is a likelihood that it could have happened here as well. And yet, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=256.64s)]
*  there was no evidence to suggest that it had happened to these hostages. But at the time, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=262.32s)]
*  the colonizer's imagination was the only evidence necessary. I-24 said Israel prepares for female [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  hostages in Gaza to return pregnant. Report Israel permits abortion up to the moment of birth. Medical [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=276.64s)]
*  professionals stressed the mental toll of conceiving the re**p in captivity. More than nine months, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=281.2s)]
*  Hostage Family Forum publishes videos implying pregnant hostages. The video depicts a tunnel, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=285.52s)]
*  which cuts to a video of a pregnant woman and the sound of a baby crying. And yet, when they were [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=290.4s)]
*  released, unlike the horrifying conditions of the Palestinians that were falsely detained by the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=295.2s)]
*  Israeli apartheid regime, in spite of the fact that they literally were also side by side with [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=304.64s)]
*  Palestinians experiencing the ruthless Israeli b***** campaigns, they came across far healthier [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=310.16s)]
*  than the Palestinian prisoners that are released on a daily basis. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  So [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=340.16s)]
*  Karina Ariyev, Daniela Gilboa, Liri Olbak and Nama Levi wave at the cameras. They know a beaming [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=342.48s)]
*  footage back home to their friends and new conspiracy. They gave birth and the babies are [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=349.36s)]
*  hostage. Now I have a horrible theory. What if they were impregnated, gave birth and now released [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=353.6s)]
*  without their babies and now Hamas is blackmailing and using those babies to keep them from telling [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  the world would happen. It's not out of the realm of possibility for the sick animals, 420 likes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=362.72s)]
*  I would treat those babies like the devil spawn, but one, they're Jewish, two aren't babies innocent [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=366.88s)]
*  and have no say in how they're born. And they're the seed of devil sub humans. So it's interesting [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=371.12s)]
*  to see in real time how a population that has been completely captive to f***** propaganda that spawned [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=375.52s)]
*  over almost an entire century, right? Reacts to situations like this. One day, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=387.44s)]
*  if the world has not completely fallen to authoritarian fascism, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=395.76s)]
*  historians will look back at these moments and document and will greatly, I guess, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=403.6s)]
*  elevate the field of f***** scholarship, scholarship surrounding and historical research [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=411.12s)]
*  surrounding how a captive population receives f***** doctrine and how it changes their collective [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=420.48s)]
*  psyche. This is the fantasies of an insane person. Okay. And it's happening in real time and it's very [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=429.52s)]
*  consequential. Like this is the very fact that people don't immediately go, this is the most [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  insane thing I've ever heard in my entire life. You are out of your mind. And instead people go, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  you know what? You're probably saying a very scary truth right now is damning for anyone with any [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=450.88000000000005s)]
*  critical thinking skills. Okay. It's devastating, but that is the reason why they did this release, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=459.36s)]
*  this show of force, this show to basically say, look, the conditions that you claim that these [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=466.24s)]
*  hostages were in is not the conditions that they were actually in. An all matter of death and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=472.56s)]
*  devastation that they experienced came in the hands of Israeli b***** campaigns. Now this has been [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=478.32s)]
*  a consistent thing that we have heard from Israeli hostages that have been released from the first [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=485.04s)]
*  release that took place on humanitarian grounds. I think her name was Lipschitz, the old lady, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=493.36s)]
*  all the way to even the likes of Noah Argani, who was a very famous Israeli captive that was [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=500.0s)]
*  taken from the Nova Festival, if you recall. Most Israeli hostages and prisoners of war have [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=508.32000000000005s)]
*  Israeli hostages and prisoners of war have repeatedly said the exact same things that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=515.92s)]
*  the real fear that they experienced was the bombs, bombs falling on them indiscriminately. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=524.24s)]
*  And even Israeli news has reported this in spite of the obvious restrictions placed upon Israeli [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=532.16s)]
*  media from its f***** government. I fear, and I say this with sincerity, I fear this has happened [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=540.8s)]
*  throughout history under very similar circumstances, as a matter of fact. If you recall, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=548.24s)]
*  the entire concept of the Manchurian candidate going all the way back to the Korean War for a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=555.04s)]
*  brief moment is born out of a very similar perspective. The American government, the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=560.4799999999999s)]
*  American State Department, alongside American interests in the region, consistently dehumanized [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=567.52s)]
*  both the Koreans and the Chinese, right? And because of that, when American soldiers were [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=573.04s)]
*  held captive by the Koreans or the Chinese, they were not mistreated, yet the media kept saying [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=582.4s)]
*  that they were. So when they actually came back and reported on their actual experiences, while [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=588.56s)]
*  we were supposed to maintain the position that these are some of the most, like, f***** over [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=597.1199999999999s)]
*  people, right? They were held captive by the enemy because they did not play along with American [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  propaganda. We assumed that they were brainwashed. We assumed that they had actually fallen to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  communist b*******. B******* literally comes from this. It was first utilized by American media [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=622.08s)]
*  to explain the process of how soldiers being held by Korean and Chinese communists [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=633.92s)]
*  did not have negative opinions about them, and more so started talking about imperialism [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=643.36s)]
*  in certain instances. That's where the term brainwashing comes from. Something that is in, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=651.52s)]
*  you know, our colloquial, it's in common lexicon at this point. Something that you just don't even [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=656.64s)]
*  think about. That's where it literally comes from. Isn't that crazy? The idea, the idea [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=662.88s)]
*  that the treatment, the expectation was that our enemy will treat our soldiers in an inhumane way, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  pure projection. And when the reality doesn't match the expectations and the lies, we turn around [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=677.6s)]
*  and we say, well, there's something more nefarious afoot. Okay? This was the testimony of Noah [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=685.6s)]
*  Argimani, a freed Israeli hostage that was featured widely in Israeli media that claimed she was beaten [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  and abused while in captivity. An hour ago, she posted a clarification on her Instagram story, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=695.76s)]
*  saying that Israeli media basically lied about it at all. Here is her own words. I can't ignore what [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=699.84s)]
*  has been going on in the media here in the last 24 hours. Things are out of context. They didn't [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=705.52s)]
*  beat me and didn't cut my hair. I was in a building that was blown up by the Air Force. The exact quote [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=708.56s)]
*  is, this week and after my shooting, as I said, I had cuts all over my head and hit my whole body. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=712.96s)]
*  I emphasize they didn't hit me, but I was hurt all over my body from the collapse of the structure on [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=717.68s)]
*  me. As a victim of the 7th of October, I will not allow myself to be a victim again by the media. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=722.24s)]
*  And what's additionally shocking about this is that these are people who live in Israel. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  These are people who are also susceptible to the same propaganda cycles when they grew up with this [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=734.4s)]
*  social conditioning. And yet even they are like, dude, that's not the case. You are using my own [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=741.2s)]
*  personal experience and my own personal story, the horrifying conditions that I went through [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=748.56s)]
*  to lie. This girl, yes, meant Trump. Here it is. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm excited, but we knew this moment would come. We had no doubt it would come. It's been too long. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=768.16s)]
*  They're on their way home and we're waiting for all the other hostages. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=775.68s)]
*  The West Bank. In return in Ramallah, the West Bank, Israel began releasing Palestinian prisoners, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=778.8s)]
*  200 in total, some taken by minibus to Khan Yunis Gaza. We thank the Palestinian resistance, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=786.0s)]
*  specifically Al Qassam brigades and Al Quds brigades. And we thank every Palestinian resistance [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=794.56s)]
*  fighter, but those who'd been convicted of the most violent crimes won't be allowed home. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=799.3599999999999s)]
*  Instead deported outside the Palestinian territories. This bus crossing the border to Egypt. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=804.64s)]
*  Large swathes of Gaza lie in ruins for the ordinary Gazans whose lives have been torn [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=812.72s)]
*  asunder by Israel's devastating pursuit of Hamas. So here's more footage from their release as well. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  Breaking Nenny houses, Israel block Palestinian return to North Gaza until dispute over captive [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=825.52s)]
*  Arbel Yehud is settled. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Anya was issued a statement saying Israel [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  will not allow Palestinians to cross into Northern Gaza as a creed upon in the ceasefire deal until [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=833.76s)]
*  the issue of the female civilian captive Arbel Yehud, who Israel expected to be released on [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=837.84s)]
*  Saturday, is resolved. Earlier Israeli military spokesperson Avichai Adre wrote on X that Hamas [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=841.84s)]
*  had violated the ceasefire agreement. Hamas released four IDF soldiers this morning. 200 [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=847.28s)]
*  Palestinian captives are set to be released shortly and they have been, I think. Now, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=850.8s)]
*  here is some information about this as well. Hold on. Seth Harp says strict adherence to the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=856.16s)]
*  laws of war and dignified treatment of your enemy confers a powerful strategic advantage in the long [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=861.04s)]
*  term. Hamas is constantly outsmarting Israel. See, this is like perhaps the most logical way [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  of looking at it to a degree where like, even if you believe that there are some really bad guys [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=871.28s)]
*  in Hamas and that's an understandable position to have, right? Especially if you're, you know, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  a fucking American. Like it is the logical thing to do. Do you understand? It's kind of the same, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  it's kind of the same principle that I maintained throughout the past, throughout the past 15, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=888.64s)]
*  throughout the past 15, 16 months where people would come in here and be like, no, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=896.08s)]
*  they're definitely killing the hostages. And I kept repeating over and over again, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=899.52s)]
*  there is no logical reason for Hamas to just execute a hostage without showing it on camera. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=903.36s)]
*  Okay. If you recall, if you recall, I kept saying, if Hamas kills a hostage, if Al Qassam kills a [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=910.88s)]
*  hostage, if the Palestinian Islamic Jihad kills a hostage, you will know because they will use that [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=917.52s)]
*  as propaganda. They will, because these hostages are their only form of leverage. These hostages [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=925.04s)]
*  are a bargaining chip. So their welfare, their wellbeing is of supreme importance. Okay. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=930.8s)]
*  When the enemy is doing a genocide on your people, you have to protect them no matter what. So the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=938.96s)]
*  notion that these guys actually had kidnapped these people in this incredibly complex, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=945.12s)]
*  unimaginable military operation that actually yielded a tremendous amount of trauma and, and [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=949.68s)]
*  horrifying atrocities in the process, make no mistake, right? I'm not an apologist on any of [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=957.04s)]
*  that. That was not done for simple pleasure. Okay. You have to be a fucking idiot to assume that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=962.8s)]
*  It was not done because they wanted to kidnap Israelis and like rape them and kill them [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=969.6s)]
*  for funsies. It was done for a very clear purpose. And this is the issue that I have specifically [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=973.92s)]
*  with foreign policy. Foreign policy in the United States of America is riddled with thought [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=981.28s)]
*  terminating terms and, and media cycles. Okay. The designation of terrorism, the notion that all of [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  the enemies of America and all of the enemies of America's allies are actually operating with this [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=998.48s)]
*  like parasitic hive mind, a modus operandi that they don't have any sort of like, they don't have [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1004.48s)]
*  any sort of like logical investment or interest in, in, in emancipation. They don't have any [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1011.36s)]
*  humanity, right? That they're simply operating, simply operating on, on the lines of doing [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1018.0s)]
*  brutality, right? If that is the method, if that is the way you approach it, and many, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1026.08s)]
*  because of the way that the media covers this stuff, many in America do approach it like that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a war of good versus evil, yada, yada, yada. You are going to always find yourself confused [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  when you see stuff like this. And in that confusion, in that confusion, because you're not exercising [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1044.48s)]
*  critical thinking, in that confusion, you're just going to fall further and further into the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1050.56s)]
*  whims of propaganda. And that's how you arrive at the concept of brainwashing. That's how you [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1055.84s)]
*  arrive at these like grand narratives, right? That like, maybe these people actually did rape [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1061.28s)]
*  them and are holding their babies hostage. And that's why they have to play ball. And it also, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1067.36s)]
*  weirdly enough, will create resentment in the Israeli population against the prisoners, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  the hostages that have been released if they come out and say, no, these guys didn't actually like, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1079.68s)]
*  these guys didn't actually rape us, like you're insane. Okay? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1085.52s)]
*  Now, I'm not 100% certain about the well-being of these soldiers. Okay? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1093.92s)]
*  I'm not. I don't know, and only time will tell. But from what I've seen from Israeli media so far, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  is that people are worried about, people are worried about like, what, how the Israeli [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  prisoners of war are carrying themselves thus far because of this sort of footage. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1119.8400000000001s)]
*  No humiliation dignified in their military uniform. This is our prisoners of war must be treated under [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1125.52s)]
*  international law. On the other hand, civilians, doctors, journalists, women, and children are [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1129.2s)]
*  kidnapped and tortured and raped in Israeli dungeons. Amos has learned from the story of [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1132.48s)]
*  the Palestinian resistance in 1983, Pielo had captured an IDF soldier in Lebanon, Hezzi Shai, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1137.36s)]
*  look him up. And he tried to commit suicide because as he said later, I wanted to screw the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1141.4399999999998s)]
*  Palestinians and deprive them of their bargaining chip. And Arafat had ordered that his captors keep [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1145.04s)]
*  him alive at all costs until he was released in 1985 in exchange for 1,000 Palestinians. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1149.76s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, by the way, this is another part of this. MKUltra, the program. Like, this is, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1155.84s)]
*  this is what's so interesting about both American history and the history of empire in general is [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1162.64s)]
*  that things that we know, right? Like the MKUltra program, which was a failure, it didn't reach its [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1167.2s)]
*  intended goals. I mean, it maybe was successful in some ways, but it was ultimately a failure that [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1173.2s)]
*  like the American government had no way of like brainwashing people and controlling them. Right? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1178.0s)]
*  That program literally was created to, as the chatter correctly points out, reverse engineer [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1183.2800000000002s)]
*  the Manchurian candidate communist brainwashing. Now what's really interesting about that is, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1189.28s)]
*  what's really interesting about that process is that not only do we tell lies, right? When the [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1193.76s)]
*  reality on the ground does not match our expectations or the lies that we've told prior, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1199.92s)]
*  we then believe our own lies. Think about that. Like these are people who looked at the situation [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1204.96s)]
*  and were like, there is no way that they were actually going to be able to do that. And so [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1211.36s)]
*  there's no way that they were actually not mistreated. These American soldiers were not [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1216.72s)]
*  actually mistreated and they simply are brainwashed. The concept that we made up that they're actually [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1221.44s)]
*  secretly sleeper cells being activated to undermine American dominance or whatever. Right? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1227.2s)]
*  And that we should also do the same and reverse engineer how they were brainwashed [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1236.56s)]
*  and figure out a way to do it ourselves. It's interesting. Like it's fascinating when you [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1241.8400000000001s)]
*  think about it, where you tell a lie so much that you yourself believe it and then decide [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1247.92s)]
*  that spend money and effort to try to create your own version of it. Understand? When the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1256.64s)]
*  alternative is simple, which is, I don't know, take the truth at face value, investigate thoroughly, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1263.44s)]
*  Nope. Can't do that. Can't do that. God forbid we do that. We can't do that. Hold on. It's like the [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1270.8s)]
*  Republicans. Yeah. It would be akin to the Republicans trying to build a weather machine [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1276.72s)]
*  to control the weather after consistently claiming that like there's a Chinese weather machine. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1280.56s)]
*  And then they tried to like build their own version of it, you know, instead of addressing [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1286.0s)]
*  climate change, which now that you said it, now that I'm thinking about it is probably [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1290.1599999999999s)]
*  something that we are going to do. I can't wait for Pete Heggett to oversee this operation. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1296.72s)]
*  He takes it's like, listen, we have to make our own Jewish Chinese weather machines. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1304.24s)]
*  And as the secretary of defense, I'm going to be working tirelessly around the clock to make our [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1308.4s)]
*  own. We're, we're tasking some of our top Jewish and Chinese scientists to make a Jewish Chinese [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1314.0800000000002s)]
*  weather machine ourselves. It cannot be only in the hands of the CCP. The American government [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1321.1200000000001s)]
*  must have this technological advancement. What is this for the military and intelligence [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1327.52s)]
*  communities mind control hovered between myth and science. Nowhere is this more obvious than [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1332.96s)]
*  the peculiar case of an anonymously published 1950 55 pamphlet called brainwashing, a synthesis [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1336.0800000000002s)]
*  of the Russian textbook on psycho politics, which purported to be a translation of work by the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1341.0400000000002s)]
*  secret Soviet secret police chief, love rentive love rentee Bedia, full of wild claims about how [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1346.56s)]
*  the Soviets use psychology and drugs to control the masses. The pamphlet has a peculiar section [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1353.6799999999998s)]
*  devoted to the ways that Dianetics, a pseudoscience invented by the founder of Scientology, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1358.6399999999999s)]
*  Elron Hubbard could prevent brainwashing. As a result, it is widely believed that Hubbard [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1363.2s)]
*  himself wrote the pamphlet as black propaganda or propaganda that masquerades as something produced [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1367.76s)]
*  by a foreign adversary. The defecting MK ultra was trying to stop. Yeah, this, this is it. Yeah. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1373.52s)]
*  This is what MK ultra tried to stop. I wonder if Israel has their own version of this too. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1380.0s)]
*  You will be brainwashed. Me, America's son. That will be a challenge. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1384.32s)]
*  You bet. Our enemies are all those in league with imperialism, the bureaucrats, the fake landlord [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1393.52s)]
*  class and the reactionary section of the intelligence he attached to them. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1400.88s)]

*  us by prioritizing our battle, such as by hostage taking. She, you know, we traveled to Lebanon in [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1462.32s)]
*  1971 and founded the Japanese red army, which linked up with the Palestinian fighters become [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1466.88s)]

*  because of his deadly and spectacular acts from plane hijackers to hostage taking mostly in the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1477.2s)]
*  1970s. Chikunobu is believed, dude, the seventies were so crazy for plane hot plane hostage taking [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1481.2s)]
*  like it is wild that for virtually three decades, right? Air travel was kind of hit or miss, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1489.1200000000001s)]
*  where you could just bring a gun on a fucking plane and be like, I'm this is mine now. It was [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1499.44s)]
*  truly a wild time, dude. When you think about it, like that's not that long ago. Like your parents [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1506.08s)]

*  should bring that back. And also smoking, you should be able to smoke on planes. You should be [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1520.0s)]

*  Israeli soldiers that were released, I suspect that, you know, they're not all going to have [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1803.4399999999998s)]
*  the same opinions. And I'm not, I'm not certain that they will maintain the position that they [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1809.36s)]
*  were like, they, they're not, they might not echo the same sentiment that other Israeli hostages [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1814.0s)]
*  and Israeli prisoners of war have, have echoed and have delivered. Right. I'm not saying that [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1820.08s)]
*  at all. That only time will tell. Right. So we shall see what happens in that process. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1825.36s)]
*  But even in the interim, as far as we can see the notion that they were like, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1832.24s)]
*  the notion that they were, were like, you know, impregnated, it does not seem to be correct. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1839.2s)]
*  What is this? Here's drop site news. Oh, this is the, this is the full video for the prisoner [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1848.72s)]
*  exchange video. All four Israeli hostages are now reunited with their families. This is a wonderful [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1856.56s)]
*  day, by the way, for the record. This is a great thing. Oh, they give them key chains, Al Qasam key [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1860.4s)]
*  chains. And yeah, certificates. What the, what is happening, dude? They give them, so I saw these [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1876.4s)]
*  gift bags before, like they give him goodie bags. So we saw this. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1884.64s)]
*  So obviously every act of, every act of existence from the Palestinian side is a form of resistance [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1914.64s)]
*  as we've talked about quite extensively. But the very fact that these Palestinian militant groups [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1940.96s)]
*  are still capable of operating in, in Gaza in broad daylight in this way is 100%. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1950.72s)]
*  Perhaps the most devastating counter message to everything that Israel has communicated [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1962.32s)]
*  to Israeli society thus far. Okay. It's, it's just like, it's crazy that hostage comment is going [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1969.92s)]
*  straight to Ethan's videos. Mark my words. I mean, okay. Like I don't know what to tell you, you know, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1978.24s)]

*  despite what it is, what it was exposed to during the war. I mean, that is the truth. Yeah. That's [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1994.4s)]
*  what they're trying to do. I mean, it just, every single part of this is basically a, a direct [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=1998.16s)]
*  counter. Every single part of this is a direct counter to like key ways of communicating. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2016.4s)]
*  No surprise about the presence of so many Hamas fighters. Oh yeah. No, yeah. We, Hamas has recruited [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2024.08s)]
*  10,000 to 15,000 members since the war with Israel began, according to us intelligence brief to [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2029.52s)]
*  Congress, a similar number of fighters have been killed in the same period. Yeah. Like who could [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2033.04s)]
*  have thought, Oh man, who, who, who could have seen this coming, dude? How shocking that this thing [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2038.48s)]
*  that happens every single time in occupying force, every single time an occupying force dominates [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2045.52s)]
*  an entire region and destroys them. Okay. It leads to the resistance growing. This is the [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2054.48s)]
*  least shocking event of all time. But yeah, the key, the key points that are being made in these [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2063.36s)]
*  sorts of videos and in general is like one, the, the Israeli hostages were due to their, you know, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2069.12s)]
*  due to them being the only existing form of leverage that, that Hamas and the Palestinian [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2078.32s)]
*  resistance coalition forces had over the apartheid state that was, you know, conducting a genocide, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2084.96s)]
*  due to them being the only leverage point, they were not mistreated to the best of their ability. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2091.92s)]
*  Right. And not only that, but also, not only that, but also I'm gonna close the blinds by the way, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2097.44s)]
*  getting super blown out behind me. But also that they're still in operation. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2104.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, Fusco's daughter. She's a journalist that speaks English. Yeah. I might, I might see if I [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2111.68s)]
*  can secure a [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2116.72s)]
*  little bit of a [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2164.24s)]
*  I guess from the Israeli, from the Israeli side, like if you, if you need to, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2168.7999999999997s)]
*  if, if you must, whoa, why is this so dark now? Now it's like shockingly dark and scary. Oh, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2176.7999999999997s)]
*  much better. Nevermind. That other light away. There we go. Now it's good. From, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2185.52s)]
*  from the Israeli side, like they have to, they, they have to maintain this position [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2193.36s)]
*  that Hamas is like violent and have no, like Palestinian resistance is, is not born out of [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2202.4s)]
*  understandable desire for emancipation against a, against an apartheid state that is dominating [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2209.92s)]
*  their lives. But instead they're scary. They're evil barbarians that only want to do this because [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2217.6s)]
*  they have no reason to do this, but they're doing all of the things, all of the resistance because [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2223.36s)]
*  they're evil, antisemitic, rapist, barbaric monsters. Right? So they have to maintain that [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  position. And, and it's one that you can obviously easily destroy no matter how much control you have [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2234.0s)]
*  over the way these things are shown to the otherwise captive audience. So let's finish this. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2248.8s)]
*  Let's finish this. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2256.5600000000004s)]

*  can see in this image in and of itself. Right. It's just that when that violence is dished out [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2376.32s)]
*  by a state, especially a state that is aligned with American interests, a state that is a, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2383.44s)]
*  a vehicle for American interests in a region, okay. A incredibly important ally like Israel, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2389.04s)]
*  that violence is seen as normal. And in order to justify that violence, you have to do a steady [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2395.28s)]
*  diet of propaganda. Okay. Politics is literally about who gets to do the violence in many instances. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2399.76s)]
*  Okay. America gets to do the violence. Anyone who resists against that is bad. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2408.56s)]
*  Israel gets to do the violence. Anyone who resists against that is bad. That's, that's the, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2414.16s)]
*  that's the violence that is unacceptable. Okay. So there is no, there is virtually no movement [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2419.36s)]
*  that has advanced any sort of civil rights or civil liberties or any sort of like [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2426.0s)]
*  emancipatory goals without like engaging in violence. And our history is covered with that. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2430.08s)]
*  The revolutionary war was violent. The civil war was violent. Right. How are most borders in the [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2436.16s)]
*  world drawn? Through violence. And there are many different forms of said violence, but we don't [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2441.7599999999998s)]
*  need to get into that right now. And the, this is not like an academic setting. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2447.2799999999997s)]
*  Hama failed to meet its obligations to first release Israeli female civilian hostages as part [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2451.04s)]
*  of the agreement. Honestly, Hamas is best bet is to probably surrender and leave Palestine. I see [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2462.08s)]
*  no other way. The USA will not stop his blood thirst. Yeah. No, famously, famously it was [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2466.88s)]
*  always Hamas except it wasn't right. Hamas is but an idea, all but a name. It's nothing. Okay. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2472.7999999999997s)]
*  Hamas is simply the newest version of militant resistance against the Israeli apartheid. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2481.36s)]
*  That's it. It's going to be called something else. When you orphan 40,000 children in the Gaza strip, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2489.44s)]
*  it's going to be called Hamas too. Okay. Do you understand? It's going to be called something else. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2496.32s)]
*  There's always going to be an understandable need for emancipation. This is the most human thing. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2501.6s)]
*  Okay. That's it. That's it. So as long as Israeli sovereignty reigns over the Palestinians, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2510.72s)]
*  there will always be some kind of resistance. It doesn't have to be called Hamas. And it is [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2518.64s)]
*  throughout Israeli history in its 76 years of occupation. Okay. It's taken secular forms, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2523.84s)]
*  Marxist forms. It's taken Islamist forms in its last iteration that still maintains a coalition [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2531.84s)]
*  alongside all other varying degrees of political ideology. That's it. And this is something that I [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2538.64s)]
*  think a lot of Israeli generals, including even fucking rear Admiral Dumbo Hagari understands [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2548.0s)]
*  and has talked about. When Israeli generals say there is no military solution to Hamas, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2558.16s)]
*  that is precisely what they mean. Okay. And he can hear me, even though I'm in Japan, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2563.12s)]
*  he can hear me all the way from Israel right now. Maybe he's heard me when I've talked about these [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2569.52s)]
*  things. And that's why he also has communicated this reality when Israeli generals like war [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2574.64s)]
*  criminal, you have Galant, the former defense minister says there is no permanent military [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  solution to eradicating Hamas. We can not solve this problem through military action. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2585.68s)]
*  This is what they mean. What they actually mean is that unless you kill every single [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2590.24s)]
*  Palestinian and even then there's still going to be, you know, a lot of people that live in diaspora, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2596.56s)]
*  there's always going to be a need for emancipation. People are always going to say, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2603.04s)]
*  no, what the hell? I don't want to live under your rulership. This is insane. This is [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2608.2400000000002s)]
*  completely unacceptable. You're killing my family. You've destroyed my home. You've destroyed [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2612.56s)]
*  the mosque I go to. You destroyed the church I go to. You destroyed the school I went to. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2619.2000000000003s)]
*  You killed my teacher. You killed my cousin. You killed my uncle. You killed my mother. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2624.2400000000002s)]
*  You tortured my family. Do you understand? Ironically enough, the actual solution [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2629.12s)]
*  to ending this unnecessary bloodshed comes from once again pressuring the state that is responsible [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2637.9199999999996s)]
*  for the bloodshed and the violence continuing. It's making sure that Israel actually meets the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2646.3999999999996s)]
*  standards of international law. That would go an incredibly long way of curbing back most of this [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2652.08s)]
*  violence. Okay? And the only way that can be done is if the American government decides, all right, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2660.7999999999997s)]
*  our designs for the Middle East have changed. And through this war of attrition, we have recognized [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2666.0s)]
*  that it's probably better that we abide by the standards that we are supposed to abide by [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2671.84s)]
*  under international law. And we are forcing Israel's hand to, you know, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2678.56s)]
*  carve out a real humanitarian solution here. Whatever the cause of the delay, hugs for the [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2684.7999999999997s)]
*  children they feared they'd never see alive again. Just some of the families who've been ripped apart [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2694.08s)]
*  since October 7th. I love you. All the citizens of Israel who supported our families [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2700.08s)]
*  and our soldiers who did everything for us. Thank you very much. I love you. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2708.48s)]
*  Heartfelt reunions in Israel and the Palestinian territories. But beyond the numbers and the stark [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2714.72s)]
*  asymmetry of the two prisoner swaps, this ceasefire is far from guaranteed with negotiations for what's [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2723.6s)]
*  called stage two of the deal due to start this week. Well, just before we came on air, I spoke [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2730.72s)]
*  to Jennifer Gavito, who's a former us diplomat and now a senior fellow, the father, one of the [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2738.16s)]
*  hostages, by the way, just the reminder, Ellie Albaugh father of his daily POV, Leary Albaugh, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2742.64s)]
*  who was released today. He made it very clear after the potential deal he's seeking the genocide [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2746.72s)]
*  should continue in both Gaza and the West bank. He says in these 10 months, another 50,000 terrorists [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2750.56s)]
*  were born in Gaza. There were 2 million Hamas people and there are 2 million more in Judea [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2756.72s)]
*  and Samaria for me. They're all Hamas says Ellie Albaugh, father of the Israeli prisoner of war, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2760.16s)]
*  Leary Albaugh and one of the, one of the main figures in the captive's families pro deal [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2765.68s)]
*  campaign said these words on hop out through a team talk show on any house propaganda channel outlet [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2772.7999999999997s)]
*  channel 14 channel 14 is, is the biggest network, the premier BBS network in Israel. He made it [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2778.0s)]
*  very clear after the potential deal he's seeking the genocide should continue in both Gaza and the [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2784.8799999999997s)]
*  West bank. His daughter, Leary Albaugh 19 was taken captive by Hamas Al Qassam brigades on October 7 [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2788.7999999999997s)]
*  along with several other Israeli occupying force spotters from the army base where they were serving [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2793.28s)]
*  in the hall. Oh, bro, when you say a terrorist was born, you just lost the plot. I think there is a, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2798.0800000000004s)]
*  a more sinister admission of the truth there. Okay. Like on the one hand, yes, it's just blanket [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2803.6000000000004s)]
*  racism. It's just pure unfiltered unrestricted racism, right? But the other side of that is this [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2811.76s)]
*  admission or rather the recognition that yes, we are doing unimaginable cruelty to these people. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2821.52s)]
*  And I think that's justifiable. And the cruelty necessitates one because of the initial racism, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2829.28s)]
*  but the cruelty necessitates because these people will always resist against our incredibly violent [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2836.16s)]
*  endeavors. Okay. Atlantic council. I asked her about the delayed release of civilian hostage, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2841.12s)]
*  our Belyehud and how much of a problem it might cause. There is a great deal of speculation about [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2848.96s)]
*  why that might be. There have been accusations that perhaps she's being held not by Hamas, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2856.4s)]
*  but by Palestinian Islamic shihad. And that that still has to be worked out. Whatever the reason, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2862.08s)]
*  the release of the four IDF soldiers this morning surrounded by Hamas fighters presented quite [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2868.56s)]
*  a striking picture. Right. And that might have in fact been what Hamas was, was agitating for. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2876.0s)]
*  That being said, the Israeli government was very quick to point out that this was a violation of [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2882.56s)]
*  the ceasefire agreement. And my understanding is that there are urgent negotiations happening as [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2888.16s)]
*  we speak. And you mentioned the, the footage that we've all been seeing of the four soldiers. To [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2894.08s)]
*  what extent is that going to make it more difficult for the moderate? This is Pete getting [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2901.84s)]
*  got by propaganda. He could direct his anger to fixing the situation, the future and being [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2906.88s)]
*  activist. But instead he got propaganda and focused on his energy on genocide. Unfortunate. Yeah. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2910.0s)]
*  In Israel to continue to work towards a ceasefire and a durable one at that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2915.36s)]
*  Despite the Israeli government's assertions and attempts, Hamas still exists and continues to be [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2922.6400000000003s)]
*  a force to be reckoned with. And so in my mind that really reinforces the urgency of moving ahead [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2929.76s)]
*  with the ceasefire. In fact, figuring out how to get Palestinian authority control over Gaza in [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2936.0s)]
*  order to displace Hamas. And more importantly, down the road, the importance of rebuilding, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2942.6400000000003s)]
*  showing Palestinians that there is a different Hamas leadership and that there, you know, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2947.84s)]
*  with Israel is some sort of pathway to peace. And how realistic do you think it is that Palestinians [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2952.5600000000004s)]
*  do find a way to support other leaders in Gaza that are less likely to choose a militant path? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2958.56s)]
*  Certainly more challenging than it was pre-October 7th. The Palestinian authority has been, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2969.2s)]
*  through its own actions and through Israeli actions, has really been undermined, diminished [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2976.96s)]
*  over the course of many years. And so there's a lot involved with this, as both of the recent [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2984.8s)]
*  U.S. administrations have spoken about. You have to reform the Palestinian authority. You have to [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2989.84s)]
*  give Israel confidence that its borders will be secure. I mean, these are years long undertakings. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=2995.36s)]
*  This is not a short-term project. And before you can do any of that, you have to find a way to [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3001.76s)]
*  rebuild Gaza. You have to provide homes, food, really critical humanitarian assistance. And so [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3006.72s)]
*  far, there doesn't seem to be a good plan in place to do any of that. Thank you very much indeed for [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3014.9599999999996s)]
*  joining us. We're grateful for your insights. Take care. In the midst of this frenzy, coaches [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3020.56s)]
*  carrying around 60 prisoners returned here to the West bank to be greeted by a wall of emotion. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3029.68s)]
*  So I take it because you never know D that there is no real Palestinian censorship on tick-tock. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3037.44s)]
*  I am not entirely certain as to how much censorship is happening. I think that there is a [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3043.44s)]
*  understandable panic right now. And some of that understandable panic might be real. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3049.44s)]
*  Okay. But I don't know. I don't know like how severe the, the censorship is currently [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3053.6s)]
*  among the crowd, Safia waiting for her son, Ishmael [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3066.64s)]
*  in Israel convicted of attempted murder, but to her and most in this throne, saluted as a hero. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3072.0s)]
*  We're thanking God. This is our state of mind. Thanking God for this life. Thank God. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3078.8s)]
*  This a prayer of gratitude for her son's return. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3085.52s)]
*  It is noisy and it is chaotic, but here there is a sense of jubilation as well, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3089.92s)]
*  because for many in this crowd, these coaches and the prisoners inside them represent a victory [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3096.08s)]
*  inside them represent a victory over Israel. Again and again, we're here chance in support of [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3103.68s)]
*  Hamas. The release prisoners taken to a community center for health checks. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3113.2s)]
*  You've got a straight up Nazi influencer on tick-tock and they denied a hate speech report. Does [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3119.52s)]
*  that happen sometimes though that happened even before tick-tock is both simultaneously the most [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3122.96s)]
*  like insane and intense terms of service, uh, oppose the most insane and intense terms of [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3127.68s)]
*  service standards, but also simultaneously would be so like loose sometimes regardless of like [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3133.12s)]
*  political ideology is very weird. Like it's not, I don't think it's as deliberate as it is on like [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3140.88s)]
*  Twitter, for example, some went onto hospital, but most emerged into the embrace of family, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3145.52s)]
*  friends and well-wishes. This man is Ahmed Musa released after 13 years behind bars. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3154.0s)]
*  He claimed he'd often been beaten in prison right up until his final hours. He was overjoyed at [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3161.68s)]
*  freedom. My message to all the Palestinian people, wherever they are, including in Gaza, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3169.04s)]
*  West Bank and abroad, you have mastered the art of creating joy despite the hardship and the [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3176.32s)]
*  genocide we are dealing with. And to all the free people, I say this prisoners in Israeli prison [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3182.56s)]
*  are dealing with the worst. 120 prisoners found guilty of the gravest crimes were expelled from [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3188.72s)]
*  Israeli territory. Just over half deported to Egypt. The rest sent into Gaza here on the West [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3196.16s)]
*  Bank. The site of these men coming back from captivity seemed like a seminal moment for many, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3204.56s)]
*  but the spectre of conflict goes on. I think the future is going to be more [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3210.96s)]
*  sad for us because you know what I mean? Like everything will get bad from Israel [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3219.2000000000003s)]
*  occupation for us. I think especially in West Bank. Are you scared? Yeah, of course. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3226.96s)]
*  These men were convicted by Israeli courts of some of the most serious crimes possible. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3235.44s)]
*  Yet now suddenly they're free and that is the price Israel is paying for its hostages. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3240.48s)]
*  Emily Gordine is following the story for us. She's our correspondent. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3250.0800000000004s)]
*  Hello Emily. I'll be back. Hamas released four Israeli hostages today. What's going on with them back home? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3253.84s)]
*  That's right. They were reunited with their families at a re-e-military base. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3263.28s)]
*  We already saw the footage of them being embraced by their parents. They were then flown by helicopter [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3268.08s)]
*  to the Rabin Medical Center outside of Tel Aviv where they're undergoing medical treatment and [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3273.44s)]
*  a medical evaluation. That's also where they met other family members such as their siblings, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3278.48s)]
*  for example. Now we've already heard as well from a top medical, from a top official in the Israeli [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3283.28s)]
*  health ministry about the treatment that they're receiving there. So far they've gone through [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3289.44s)]
*  quite an extensive medical evaluation that was quote emotionally and medically complex. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3295.52s)]
*  But I think it's safe to say that for the families it's a huge relief in and of itself to see their [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3300.8s)]
*  daughters come back alive. Right. Now as part of the ceasefire, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3306.24s)]
*  Israel has also released Palestinian prisoners. What do we know about them? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3311.7599999999998s)]
*  That's right. So for every soldier that Hamas released, Israel for its part released 50 [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3315.76s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners. Now we're talking about some 120 of these prisoners are said to be [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3322.7200000000003s)]
*  serving life sentences in Israeli prisons. Some were convicted for multiple murders, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3330.6400000000003s)]
*  including the killing of Israeli civilians. That being said, there's also a lot of information [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3337.76s)]
*  about the death of the Palestinian prisoners. That being said, there's also some very young [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3344.56s)]
*  prisoners who were released, the youngest one being 16 years old, the oldest one being 69 years old. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3347.04s)]
*  And we also know that the most serious offenders didn't actually arrive in the occupied West Bank. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3352.8s)]
*  They were flown out, they were taken out of the country via Egypt to neighboring countries such [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3358.56s)]
*  as Qatar and Turkey. Right. So you filmed with a young Palestinian woman who was part of last [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3362.64s)]
*  week's prisoner release. Let's have a look and come back to you afterwards. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3369.44s)]
*  It was the day Amal Shaziah had been waiting for. After seven long months in an Israeli prison, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3376.56s)]
*  she was finally released as part of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3383.36s)]
*  The joy is indescribable. Thank God. Almost a week later, we meet her at home with her family in the [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3389.52s)]
*  occupied West Bank. She's still getting used to being here. The memories of the day of her arrest [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3396.08s)]
*  still etched in her mind. When we were taken to the detention center, the four strip searches [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3402.88s)]
*  for female prisoners began, which is a very bad experience that Palestinian female prisoners go [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3412.16s)]
*  through when entering any detention center. They would do these searches daily. Often late at night, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3418.96s)]
*  they would confiscate our clothes, our personal belongings, dishes and pots. Amal was studying [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3427.6s)]
*  journalism in her last year at Birzeit University near Ramallah when the Israeli military arrested [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3434.32s)]
*  her for what they say was inciting violence. The occupiers were opposed to student activism on the [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3440.4s)]
*  university campus, even though this student activism is officially approved by the university [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3447.36s)]
*  administration. For her family, it's a relief to see her back home, having been prevented from [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3452.7200000000003s)]
*  visiting her for the entire time she was incarcerated. Amal says that was one of the worst parts of being [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3459.84s)]
*  in prison. We'd see our families just for a few seconds during the court session, which was held [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3466.88s)]
*  electronically. We would only see them for very brief moments. If I tried to communicate with them [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3476.4s)]
*  during that time or signal to reassure them I was in good health, the soldier would cut off the [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3484.08s)]
*  connection and everything would end there. It was a feeling of deep oppression and humiliation. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3490.2400000000002s)]
*  Reports like these are common among Palestinians who were released from Israeli prisons. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3499.2000000000003s)]
*  According to the Prisoner Advocacy Group, Adamir, this together with reports of starvation policies, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3504.56s)]
*  overcrowding and lack of proper medical attention. And even when people are released, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3511.2000000000003s)]
*  they may not be free for long. All of the detainees, whether being released to the West Bank [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3517.04s)]
*  or to East Jerusalem, they need to continuously show up for court appointments. And in this, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3521.52s)]
*  it's very possible that the detainee could be easily targeted and faced with a re-arrest. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3529.12s)]
*  With all previous exchange deals that we've seen before, the detainees were subjected to [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3535.68s)]
*  re-arrests, even the November 2023 deal. Yeah, they have done this already, even in this new crop of [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3543.52s)]
*  detainees that have been released. I am doing some stretches, sorry, I have to stretch because [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3551.04s)]
*  if I don't, my lower back, I mean, even when I do stretches, my lower back gets pretty messed up [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3557.52s)]
*  by the end of the day. Majority, well, not majority, 27 of the free detainees were subjected to [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3563.44s)]
*  re-arrests. For now, Amal is trying to settle back. She tells me that she wants to get back to her [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3571.28s)]
*  podcast that she started at university and finish her degree to become a journalist herself so she [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3577.44s)]
*  can continue telling the stories of other Palestinians. Of course, being arrested will [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3584.48s)]
*  not stop us from delivering our message, from conveying our cause to the world, but honestly, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3591.04s)]
*  we'll be more cautious in how we deliver the message. This, a reflection of the uncertainty [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3596.32s)]
*  many Palestinians face as they look to their future. Emily, good reporting there. So your [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3602.4s)]
*  protagonist was arrested for inciting violence. Are there many other released prisoners who were [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3610.08s)]
*  arrested for such minor crimes? The short answer to that is yes, and it is something that human [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3616.24s)]
*  rights organizations have continuously criticized Israel for. When we look at the women and the [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3625.7599999999998s)]
*  children who were released last weekend as part of the first phase of the ceasefire deal between [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3632.7999999999997s)]
*  Israel and Hamas, many of them were arrested for, for example, what they wrote on social media, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3637.92s)]
*  for participating in protests, or especially when it comes to kids, for throwing stones. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3644.16s)]
*  The Israeli and human rights organizations even go as far as to say that Israel is in fact [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3648.96s)]
*  incarcerating people in order to have them in their prisons as a future bargaining chip in [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3653.92s)]
*  when it comes to negations such as what we're seeing right now. So really heavy accusations [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3662.08s)]
*  there regarding the conditions under which, the conditions under which Palestinians are being [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3667.2799999999997s)]
*  arrested, on top of the conditions of the Israeli prisons themselves that the UN also has criticized [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3672.24s)]
*  on multiple occasions over the last few years. And what's important to say here, I think as well, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3679.04s)]
*  is that what we're hearing from human rights organizations is that since the attacks by Hamas [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3682.8799999999997s)]
*  on October 7th, and 2023, the intensity of the arrests and the conditions of the prisons themselves [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3688.3199999999997s)]
*  has rapidly deteriorated incredibly. Right. DW's Emily Gordine reporting from Jerusalem. Thank you. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3696.4s)]
*  Now I'm Jad Shawa, the head of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network. He joins [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3706.48s)]
*  us now from Deir al-Bala in the central Gaza Strip. Hello, Mr. Shawa. Some Palestinian prisoners [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3711.12s)]
*  released today just arrived in Gaza. Tell us what's happening. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3717.36s)]
*  Yes, they just arrived to the European hospital. We have medical check after they arrived and [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3720.88s)]
*  they are waiting for that they can manage to meet with their families. Part of their families were [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3729.52s)]
*  killed in this war. And just to correct what you have mentioned, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3735.36s)]
*  they are not the criminals who were released today. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3740.08s)]
*  It's not, they are not the criminals who were released today. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3742.8s)]
*  Amal wasn't committed any crime. Amal, she was struggling, demonstrating her opinion about the [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3746.32s)]
*  occupation, social, so she was arrested. So it's not my rather crime. Yeah. One of the freed hostages [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3753.92s)]
*  was re-arrested in clear violation of the deal. Israel's re-arrested freed captive Ashraf Zighir [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3759.52s)]
*  after raiding his home in Al-Quds, Jerusalem. He had just been released a few hours ago after spending [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3765.36s)]
*  over two decades in prison only to be arrested again. Not sure, not sure exactly what happened [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3770.24s)]
*  here. I don't know what the details are, but the unfortunate reality of the matter is that given [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3776.3999999999996s)]
*  that Israel has, given that Israel has, has completely destroyed the communications, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3781.8399999999997s)]
*  the media, the only media that reports from the West Bank, like consistently with the exception [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3790.56s)]
*  of like maybe on a doula Jones, the Turkish, the Turkish media, like they, they banned Al Jazeera. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3800.08s)]
*  So we don't get like real time information from trusted resources as, as fast as we normally would. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3808.16s)]
*  It's crazy. Yeah. So if you're wondering why Israel kills all of these, if you're wondering [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3816.56s)]
*  why Israel kills all these journalists, like there's an obvious reason for it. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3822.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's kind what the crime to arrest Amal herself and to put her in such detention conditions. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feHYRSlVOU&t=3825.52s)]
