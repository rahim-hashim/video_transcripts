# Privilege Behind Bars Of Luigi Mangione | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4)
*  Something that we know to be true is that Luigi Mangione looked good. Luigi Mangione did get a shape up on his eyebrows and also got a shape up on his hair a little bit. Okay, he didn't get a fade, but he did get a shape up. This is true. Someone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=0.0s)]
*  But first I want to start off with Luigi Mangione. This guy actually interviewed someone who was in the Altoona, Pennsylvania prison that talked about grooming Luigi Mangione and grooming in the, you know, normal sense of the word, not like the grooming that I'm not talking about like Minecraft streamer style grooming. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=14.48s)]
*  I'm talking like grooming his hair and whatnot in prison. So let's get started there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=40.76s)]
*  Suddenly, I'm reporting a story in real time. So I met a source who did time at the same Pennsylvania prison as Luigi. And now I think I got the story right the first time. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=47.72s)]
*  A few days ago, someone jumped in my comments and said, I did time at SCI Huntington. It's a hardcore jail with a lot of lifers. You definitely need money and clout to get a legit cut. I said, wait, what? You were locked up at the... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=60.68s)]
*  Lolo posted about these TikToks and said they're dumb. Haha. I mean, he did get a, he did get not a fade necessarily, but he did get like a haircut. Right? I mean, is that not? Didn't they? Didn't they fix them up a little bit? Didn't they shape them up a little bit? Like I'm not talking about like, you know, how these guys are lifers or it's a scary prison or whatever the every prison is scary in the United States of America. But, but I suspect that even though he was mostly in solitary confinement, he was still in solitary confinement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=74.56s)]
*  Even though he was mostly in solitary or not even solitary confinement, but like the fact that he was the fact that he got like, you know, his his lined up a little bit his eyebrows fixed up means that like someone means that someone definitely did that for him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=102.68s)]
*  Anything drugs phone or just and maybe it was about Luigi's lawyer. Ryan said, your lawyer doesn't do that. They can only bring you clothes, but you can request a cut. So I started talking more and more to this man in the comments and then in DM his name is Ryan. He asked me to withhold his last name for privacy. But he sent me a picture of his prison ID, his driver's license and an article about the crime that sent him to prison. He explained the politics of that particular prison and said that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=120.28s)]
*  that haircut was 100% a sign of respect. I 100% agree. It was respect. I didn't get a decent cut for 10 years because I was broke and a nobody. Like I said, the lifers cut hair and they do everyone in the jail. So they rush you through. They cut all day. So nice cuts that take time are reserved for important people. Also their time. So when they do a cut like this, the guard has to be on board for it. So the barber inmate had to leverage his weight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=150.28s)]
*  To do it. So that means some inmate who cuts hair in that prison said I like that kid. I respect him. I'm going to make sure that he looks good when he goes to court. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=180.28s)]
*  There was also at least one guard who said, go ahead, make it happen, but do it quick. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=191.4s)]
*  Something like that. For some level of guard complicity. And where would that come from? Respect. How much does it cost for a haircut in Huntington? Ryan said depends on the barber. But at Huntington, the currency is ice cream tickets. Ice cream tickets you use to buy soda and ice cream at yard, but you can use them to buy anything. Drugs, phone. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=196.4s)]
*  This is wrong. My husband was a barber at many PA prisons. This is all prison and county jail. Aren't the same thing. You don't go to prison until after you're convicted. A source close to Luigi. You know, so lose you. Man, you only told the day the male who got really choked up when he first saw the sport is receiving and it gives him reassurance. He will be okay. It also revealed that Luigi is sharing his commissary money with his fellow inmates. I don't know. It's tick tock. It's tick tock. So I don't know. I I'm inclined to immediately not believe it. I have this attitude that I have this blanket attitude that everything you say is wrong. I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I have this attitude that I [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=219.44s)]
*  see on tick tock is wrong. Okay. There are barbers like actual people who have the machines that can cut your hair, but that's my appointment only. And it's not every week. So if you need to get a haircut, there are [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=249.44s)]
*  do it with a calm and a razor. Jeff's take on all these videos is that it didn't mean [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=257.82s)]
*  anything beyond the barber like them and gave him a free cut before he was about to be on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=261.26s)]
*  TV and that's not it meant anything about a message of the guards that he was protected. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=264.62s)]
*  Oh, Ken also has an update on post Luigi. The extremist threat is you read the NYPD's Luigi [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=268.06s)]
*  major only report the media wouldn't publish in full. Ken Liekenstein of course is has [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=273.32s)]
*  infiltrated and intercepted this is to talk about Taurus and esteemed and respected journalists. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=278.28s)]
*  Yeah, but whatever but it's what you would also pay a barber like the barber can't deny [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=283.38s)]
*  to do your head but they will just do a job without money or respect. I'm picturing the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  barber as a black man and Ryan said that is most likely 99% of the barbers in prison are [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  black he said. Okay, a lot of this is just like this guy wasn't there. Okay, this guy [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=302.18s)]
*  was not there. The guy who he's talking to was not there while this was happening. He's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=308.97999999999996s)]
*  out of prison. So he's just talking about his own personal experiences and therefore [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=315.74s)]
*  speculating and we're speculating on top of someone else who is speculating. So maybe [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=321.14s)]
*  we'll one day find out what the truth is but something that we know to be true is that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=325.94s)]
*  looked good. Luigi Mangione did get a shape up on his eyebrows and also got a shape up [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=333.84s)]
*  on his hair a little bit. Okay, he didn't get a fade but he did get a shape up. This [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=339.08s)]
*  is true. Someone must have done it to him could have been the prison barber but I feel [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=343.67999999999995s)]
*  like if that was more official there would be more information on that or it could be [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  someone in prison but even then we don't know because the official the official information [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=355.0s)]
*  that we've gotten so far is that Luigi Mangione was not allowed to be around other inmates [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=362.58000000000004s)]
*  but it seems like someone did shape a shit up shrouded in white rich man privilege. No [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=368.86s)]
*  one cares shrouded in white rich man privilege. Oh shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Let [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=375.18s)]
*  people have things. Okay, let people have things don't do this annoying little like [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  identity hollow identity politics thing at a moment where people are just like yeah I'm [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=387.66s)]
*  going to defend this guy. Okay, stop. What do you think of people saying Al Jelani is [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=393.26s)]
*  a CIA agent. I mean he is Al Qaeda. So do with that information what you will. All right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruB7rOb5Eu4&t=398.74s)]
