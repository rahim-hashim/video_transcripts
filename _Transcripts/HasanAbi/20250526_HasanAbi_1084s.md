*  Of these details have also been confirmed by sources interviewed by Al Jazeera and al Maya Dean [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=66.64s)]
*  Scale reports that the understanding was communicated to Hamas through Palestinian American intermediary Bashar Ababa in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=71.44s)]
*  Coordination with the US envoy Steve Witkoff Hamas accepted the terms in the document [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=77.92s)]
*  It was told the US believed the framework could work pending Israeli approval [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=82.96s)]
*  But of course [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=87.0s)]
*  Israel did not offer that approval a senior source from Hamas told dropsize Jeremy scale [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=88.56s)]
*  We have accepted the Witkoff proposal which is a 60-day temporary ceasefire for releasing the 10 living Israeli prisoners five at the beginning [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  and five at the end [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=100.44s)]
*  President Trump will [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=102.08s)]
*  Personally announce the agreement [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=104.68s)]
*  But before the deal could advance Israeli officials rushed to the media to it soon after Witkoff publicly accused Hamas of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=106.68s)]
*  Misrepresenting the proposal directly contradicting what sources told drop site [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=114.52s)]
*  Had been agreed to in private discussions [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  What they are doing here? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=122.44s)]
*  What they did here is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=125.2s)]
*  Exactly the same thing that the Biden administration would do and it's exactly the same thing that the Blinken [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=129.12s)]
*  It's the exact same thing that Blinken would do [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=135.52s)]
*  It is identical. Okay [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=138.36s)]
*  it is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=141.64s)]
*  identical Biden would [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  would act as though they are listening to the Qatari envoys and then [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=146.44s)]
*  Hamas would say yes to a deal [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=152.32s)]
*  Israel would say no to said deal and then [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=155.48s)]
*  They would turn around and make it seem as though Hamas was actually disrupting the ceasefire process [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  When in fact it was always Israel [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  So there is no daylight between the Trump administration and the Biden administration on the on the way that they've dealt with Israel so [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=167.36s)]
*  far, I'm sorry, I know a lot of people want to engage in the act of wishful thinking and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=174.08s)]
*  Assume that the Trump administration could be different, but this is the exact same fell for it again. I told you so nonsense [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=181.88s)]
*  Okay, it is exactly the same shit [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=190.48s)]
*  Now what Hamas had believed it is secured is the 13-point document shown in the drop site a 70-day ceasefire a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=193.88s)]
*  Release of 10 living Israeli captives in two batches half on the first day [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  And the other half on the last day Hamas would also release the bodies of the 16 deceased captives Hamas said it needed two-week [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=203.44s)]
*  window to locate all burial sites a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=209.88s)]
*  personal public guarantee from Trump committing to the ceasefire and the pullback of Israeli forces to their March 2nd positions the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=212.44s)]
*  Resumption of unrestricted aid including food fuel medicine housing materials and construction equipment a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=219.04s)]
*  cessation of all Israeli military operations including the surveillance activities a cessation of all armed activities by Palestinian resistance groups [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=224.8s)]
*  Witkopf would personally as a guarantee or sign a ceasefire deal in Doha and shake hands with the Hamas lead negotiator. Dr. Khalil al-hayyaa [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=231.44s)]
*  Witkopf would head the US delegation which would also include Adam Adam [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=239.84s)]
*  Adam Baylor and Baba [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=244.8s)]
*  The American who is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=247.08s)]
*  has a back-channel access to Hamas which by the way is I guess [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  Not looked at so favorably by the Trump administration if it's someone like myself or Jeremy Scahill doing it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=255.08s)]
*  upon signing the ceasefire an independent technocratic committee of pal cities would immediately take charge of Gaza's governance and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=260.88s)]
*  Reconstruction efforts would commence the US and regional mediators would guarantee continued ceasefire negotiations and aid after [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  70 days until a permanent ceasefire is reached [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=274.2s)]
*  The US and as long as negotiations continue the US would remain committed to a ceasefire and facilitating aid entry until a permanent peace [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=276.8s)]
*  Agreement is reached Hamas initially proposed a 90-day ceasefire [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=283.22s)]
*  Then said it would accept a 70-day version to align with the US position Israel wanted a shorter window [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  Hamas subsequently told Scahill it had agreed to an initial 60-day truce [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=292.24s)]
*  sources told drop site that cutter particularly in the wake of a Don Alexander's release apply pressure on Trump to secure this agreement as [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  Drop site previously reported with cop promise Hamas that aid would resume got to Gaza two days after Alexander's release and Trump would call [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=303.04s)]
*  For a ceasefire negotiation the end of war neither of those happened. Can you explain what they mean by technocratic committee? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=310.76s)]
*  it just means that Hamas dissolves as a political entity and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=316.76s)]
*  all of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=321.32s)]
*  all of the civilian [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=323.4s)]
*  Governance is given to the responsibility of a separate party an [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=326.44s)]
*  Independent party comprised of Palestinians because Hamas understands the way it is perceived in the Western world [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=331.24s)]
*  They do not want a complete collapse of civil affairs, obviously [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=338.04s)]
*  they want to continuation and the efforts they want to defend the Palestinians they want to make sure that there is Palestinian sovereignty and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=342.44s)]
*  They basically are saying we're willing to have an independent technocratic committee [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=351.04s)]
*  Take over the responsibility as opposed to like offering it to the Palestinian [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=355.94s)]
*  Authority for example because that's like something that has been entertained, but they want [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=360.78s)]
*  Palestine to be led by Palestinians. They also understand that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=365.94s)]
*  They also understand that there is no world where Hamas continues to govern Palestinians because of the way that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=372.53999999999996s)]
*  People perceive Hamas but because they're more interested in once again [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=380.14s)]
*  The continuation of Palestinian existence in the Gaza Strip more so than their own like selfish ambitions of like dominating the strip as [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=386.5s)]
*  Is consistently claimed by Israel dick riders say Hamas are bad guys. They're bad guys. All they want is death and destruction [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=395.62s)]
*  They hate it. They hate the Palestinians this right here directly contradicts that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  Trump according to source have been telling regional leaders that he had given Israel two months to accomplish his objective [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=406.58s)]
*  Objectives after Israel abandoned the January ceasefire deal and now is the time to bring a war to an end [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=411.22s)]
*  To us gives a proposal to Israel Israel publicly according to wine and Jerusalem post a proposal was delivered to Israel late Sunday without prior coordination [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=415.42s)]
*  and Israeli officials reacted with alarm the eagerness with which it was in Israel indicated a deep fear that Washington would accept it and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=424.14s)]
*  Even try to impose it when Israeli official told wine it accepting it is in effect surrender to Hamas [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=431.86s)]
*  Another admitted we don't know what the Americans will say [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=438.22s)]
*  Well, it turns out Americans said exactly what they were saying under Biden as well [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=440.72s)]
*  Which is to immediately shift the blame over to Hamas because who's gonna defend Hamas who's gonna defend the truth? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=444.98s)]
*  Okay, who is going to defend the truth? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=453.06s)]
*  No one because the truth requires people to have the moral courage to openly admit that Hamas is a more [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  Responsible party that is more invested in the continuation of Palestinians in the region than Israel, which is [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  exterminationist and belligerent [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  Okay, that is a 100% truth. That is impossible [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=473.98s)]
*  impossible for for Americans to contend with it's just never gonna happen and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=480.38000000000005s)]
*  Israel knows that which is why Israel will say this deal and then Americans will turn around and go [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=485.42s)]
*  Yeah, Hamas the bad guys they up this deal up again in spite of the fact that they were the ones who put the deal together [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=491.1s)]
*  with Hamas and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=497.42s)]
*  Actually brought it to Israel [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=499.18s)]
*  But it doesn't matter the draft formulated by Baba indirect talks of Hamas was immediately declared unacceptable by Jerusalem and the rejection came before any [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=501.34s)]
*  US comment from the public so then [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  The US river reversal comes in where Steve Witkoff and by the way, this is this is a betrayal that is important [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=513.74s)]
*  Okay, Palestine gets what it deserves for supporting Palestine doesn't support [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=521.38s)]
*  Israel chatter they don't support they support emancipation and I do too. I [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=526.14s)]
*  Think you don't understand you are in enemy territory here [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=532.02s)]
*  If you consider the Palestinian population to be doing acts of as opposed to the Israeli government doing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=536.0999999999999s)]
*  unimaginable untold [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=543.6199999999999s)]
*  Acts of on a daily fucking basis. What is more than that's what Israel is doing you can [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=545.78s)]
*  You can keep relying on [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=551.22s)]
*  your lack of knowledge [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=554.42s)]
*  surrounding this matter [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=557.02s)]
*  But this is one of the few places online and one of the few places in America [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=559.02s)]
*  where we are having a real conversation where we're looking directly at both sides and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=564.14s)]
*  What [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=569.78s)]
*  What their what the agreements look like and how the American government is lying in the process? It's okay, though [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=570.98s)]
*  There will come a day where you inevitably lie to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=580.42s)]
*  Everyone around you and say oh dude. I was always pro-palestine like totally [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=584.46s)]
*  Really tough what Israel did man really tough [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=589.22s)]
*  But of course you will know the deep shame in your heart [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=591.5s)]
*  It will eat away at you like a cancer as it has already eaten away at your soul you have dehumanized yourself by defending [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=595.5s)]
*  Israel to this degree [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=603.98s)]
*  19 months in to an campaign. So let's continue [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=605.98s)]
*  So Witkoff immediately comes out after the Israeli rejection [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=610.14s)]
*  Witkoff publicly states via Axios is Brock ravine what I have seen from Hamas is disappointing and completely unacceptable [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=614.22s)]
*  This contradicted what Hamas had been led to believe during the talks with the US mediators according to scale [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=620.18s)]
*  Hamas was told the proposal met US requirements and that the next step was for Witkoff and others to work on securing Israeli approval [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=624.74s)]
*  Witkoff statement gave Israel diplomatic cover to walk away. This is exactly what the Anthony Blinken did [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=630.38s)]
*  exactly what Anthony Blinken did the only difference in this circumstance is that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=638.26s)]
*  Hamas had never direct contact with Anthony Blinken or American officials [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=643.18s)]
*  but instead were engaging in the act of shuttle diplomacy by by way of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=647.34s)]
*  Qatari diplomats in Doha and negotiators were talking to the Qatari side and then the Qatari side was talking to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=653.18s)]
*  The Israeli negotiators as opposed to Hamas directly talking to the American government. This is very important though [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=661.6999999999999s)]
*  because when Steve Witkoff who has already dropped the phase two of the ceasefire negotiations at the behest of Israel [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=669.62s)]
*  Does this with Eden Alexander only a couple weeks ago and then simultaneously is doing this now for a third time [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=677.08s)]
*  eventually [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=685.08s)]
*  Palestinians who are still desperate like Hamas who was still desperate for any kind of negotiation and any kind of like more reasonable individual more restrained individual [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=686.32s)]
*  Than Israel is going to recognize that there's not a deal that they can make with America either [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=694.12s)]
*  You know, I think some people won't regret supporting what they say that Israel are doing [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=698.64s)]
*  Some people are just so islamophobic and racist that they won't feel horrible. I mean, it's okay [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=701.82s)]
*  There's still people who like talk about Rhodesia in positive ways [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=705.72s)]
*  They're just we know what they are. They're [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=710.72s)]
*  Disgusting white supremacists. Yeah, Nazis will always exist [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=713.24s)]
*  You know Israel claims no guarantee to end the war channel 12 reported that during the discussions Hamas believed it secured American guarantees for a [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=717.0s)]
*  Permanent end of the war but Israeli officials now insist there was no such commitment according to the outlet Israel insisted the Trump admin stands by them [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  On this matter and that the American commitment is only the actual conduct of negotiations to end the war with no guarantees of results [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=730.44s)]
*  this directly contradicts with Hamas under stories and that is precisely because [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=736.4s)]
*  America is directly lying to Hamas and because the media is is directly involved in [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  Massaging the narrative at the behest of Israel [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=748.96s)]
*  No one is actually going to do the journalism or even report on the existing journalism that dropside news is doing [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=751.24s)]
*  They're never gonna go to the Hamas side to hear what the Hamas side looks like [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=757.5600000000001s)]
*  They're never going to try to develop a deeper understanding [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=762.24s)]
*  At least back in the day there this kind of investigative reporting would be conducted every now and then for every 25 articles [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=765.6400000000001s)]
*  Defending the southern Vietnamese puppet state there would be at least like one [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=773.44s)]
*  That would entertain the notion of like what the North Vietnamese Liberation Front was engaging in like what their demands were you know what I mean? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=778.0s)]
*  There would be obviously Seymour Hersh is a great example [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=786.16s)]
*  There would be investigations into the war crimes being conducted by American troops in Vietnam for example like the My Lai Massacre [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=789.28s)]
*  Nowadays [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=797.28s)]
*  though the one good brave reporting for the 25 [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=798.68s)]
*  State Department cronies is [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=804.8s)]
*  gone there isn't even that one person that engages in the act of [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=807.52s)]
*  Actually reporting on the other side and their their ambitions here or the other side's opinions [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=812.64s)]
*  And it's being conducted in a you know it's being conducted in this like black and white [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=817.8399999999999s)]
*  Open fashion like this ethnic cleansing is not being hidden at all [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=822.76s)]
*  And it's getting to a point where I think Americans will inevitably realize that there is no democratic process, and this is yet another [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=827.04s)]
*  example of such realities [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=835.52s)]
*  There is no you can demand as much as you want you can be constantly in the fucking streets you can you can do [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=838.48s)]
*  Direct actions okay, you can shut down traffic [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=845.76s)]
*  You can do whatever you want the American government hears you [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=849.28s)]
*  But they do not listen to you, and they do not care and they are going to continue defending Israel [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=852.52s)]
*  Until the very last Palestinian is ethnically cleansed from the Gaza Strip [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=858.0s)]
*  so [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=863.84s)]
*  At least that's what they're presenting right now [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=865.24s)]
*  Things can still change [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=868.24s)]
*  Obviously things can change in Europe [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=870.28s)]
*  That would apply more pressure [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=873.2s)]
*  You should not stop protesting you should still continue to apply pressure to the best of your ability [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=875.88s)]
*  You should continue to still talk about the plight of the Palestinians [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=882.08s)]
*  especially right now when [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=885.84s)]
*  We are at [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=888.44s)]
*  This is the maximum amount of pressure okay. This is [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=889.96s)]
*  The [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=894.52s)]
*  The least popular Israel has ever been throughout his history, and it will only continue to be less popular and that [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=895.56s)]
*  America will have to recalculate their strategic positioning [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=903.52s)]
*  or [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=906.96s)]
*  Directly admit that they are a fucking dictatorship [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=908.8s)]
*  Okay, and the same goes for Western [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=912.56s)]
*  Liberal democracies in general, but I wanted to just go through that for you and help you understand that this is precisely [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=916.8s)]
*  What the Anthony Blinken? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=924.04s)]
*  coalition the the Biden administration did where they would listen to the very reasonable demands being made by Hamas for hostage [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=926.68s)]
*  release in exchange for an end to the genocide and end to the occupation and [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=934.4399999999999s)]
*  Then Israel would turn around and add like a poison pill provision last second to the ceasefire negotiations or directly say no [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=939.64s)]
*  No ceasefire. We're gonna continue pummeling [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=947.12s)]
*  The Gaza Strip and then Anthony Blinken would turn around and say Hamas is not a responsible party here [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=949.8199999999999s)]
*  Hamas is not a restrained party here [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=956.02s)]
*  They are the ones who are spoiling this deal and the media would uncritically report it over and over and over again [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=957.8199999999999s)]
*  you know that that's not the truth you know that that's not the case because I [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=963.02s)]
*  Was also covering the angle from the opposing side. I was also covering the angle of the the Palestinian side [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=967.42s)]
*  Not only was I talking about the humanity of the Palestinians [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=975.34s)]
*  But I was also talking about how reasonable of a negotiating party Hamas was in this process [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=978.3800000000001s)]
*  Telling you what the truth is. This is something to remember [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=983.34s)]
*  Okay, this is something to remember. It's also [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=986.6600000000001s)]
*  Interestingly enough. It's also odd that a place that is as liberal as reddit that fucking supposedly [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=990.3800000000001s)]
*  despises the Trump administration and the unique ways in which they are [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=997.7800000000001s)]
*  Negotiating with like Russia and Ukraine and hates that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1002.26s)]
*  Will then turn around and take his word as bond take his word as though it is the ultimate truth [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1006.0200000000001s)]
*  When it comes to Israel, I wonder why I wonder why? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1012.5400000000001s)]
*  What is this Phil? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1017.1800000000001s)]
*  You can't tweet stuff like this you work for Biden and didn't do anything to push back against Biden's total deference to Israel [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1019.0600000000001s)]
*  Not only virtually the entire world but a majority of Israel support the deal to end the war and free houses yet [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1023.74s)]
*  The government continues to pursue [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1028.18s)]
*  Costly illusion of total victory reports of Trump frustration, but no sign of meaningful opposition to blockade invasion and occupation [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1030.22s)]
*  There is nothing funnier [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1036.5800000000002s)]
*  There is nothing funnier than a guy who worked at the State Department under Biden [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1039.5s)]
*  Basically repeating the correct criticism against Biden now that it is literally fucking [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1044.66s)]
*  Trump doing it here Biden disparages Netanyahu in private, but hasn't significantly changed us policy towards Israel and Gaza [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1051.26s)]
*  Interesting how the fuck did that happen, you know? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1057.48s)]
*  Yes, sometimes my camera [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1063.24s)]
*  Turns on and off for like a blip for a brief moment. Oh god. Anyway on that note [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uM9XzOYX_M&t=1065.76s)]
