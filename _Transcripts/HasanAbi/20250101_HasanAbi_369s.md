*  The year is off to a good start with some sick Twitter drama. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=300.56s)]
*  It's not even drama, but I think I think overall, and I have to blast off here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=302.96s)]
*  I think overall one thing that people have to one thing that people have to remind themselves [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  that you can't get caught up in this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=318.24s)]
*  That is what I try to hopefully instill in my chat in my audience for the best of my ability, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=320.64s)]
*  which is when you see something like that, please don't lean into it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=329.36s)]
*  Please don't jump on that bandwagon. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=334.64s)]

*  What you're a terrorist though. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=343.2s)]
*  We don't have to ban this person. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=344.64s)]
*  I think they're just memeing drama on Twitter is just that noise. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=346.4s)]
*  Having said that, however, it does have the capacity to be legitimized by the likes of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  people in this community. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=355.84s)]
*  And then it turns from noise into it turns from noise into something a little bit more annoying. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPePnWXthzQ&t=357.59999999999997s)]
