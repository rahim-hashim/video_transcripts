*  Oh yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=30.6s)]
*  It's Liz Cheney. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=31.6s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=32.64s)]
*  Well, Liz Cheney lost for Congress. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=33.64s)]
*  Each other. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=37.36s)]
*  I think they're so bad. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=38.36s)]
*  Both of them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=39.36s)]
*  Yeah, this is getting Nick on no jumper for a debate to Nick getting the yay hookup for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=40.36s)]
*  him talking to Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=43.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=44.44s)]
*  Like there is no there are no there's never a reason unless like constituents here they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=45.44s)]
*  going after here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=50.28s)]
*  What Donald Trump? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=51.8s)]
*  No the Liz Cheney thing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=52.84s)]
*  Oh, it's so. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=54.92s)]
*  Eight people like it's the most like eight people focused campaign strategy of all time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=57.28s)]
*  Who's running that? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=64.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's Liz Cheney and her immediate family, but like not even her sister who Liz Cheney [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=65.72s)]
*  literally abandoned to take a more hardline stance than her father Cheney on gay rights [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=70.36s)]
*  in an effort to win favor in the Republican primaries. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=76.44s)]
*  You know, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=80.6s)]
*  Biden's campaign manager. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is who's making it happen. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  So what is your assessment of the stakes of this election? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=87.24s)]
*  I mean, you're an exclusive club of people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  They're like, yeah, you're in a very exclusive club of people who's lost to Donald Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=93.36s)]
*  Is that the question? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=96.96s)]
*  We've ever run for president, let alone run again against Donald Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=97.96s)]
*  Yeah, she lost. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=102.8s)]
*  Let her speak. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  So to what extent do you offer counsel or do you speak with Kamal Harris about how to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  run against Donald Trump, who, as you've said, is a different candidate now, a darker candidate, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  arguably than he was in 2016? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  That's absolutely true, Willie. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=118.88s)]
*  You know, I've talked with Kamala a few times. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=120.16s)]
*  I obviously talked with her before the debate because he is more incoherent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  He is angrier. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  He is lashing out all the time at everybody. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=132.56s)]
*  He's filled with grievance and rage. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=137.04s)]
*  And you know, in my, you know, let awesome forget he lived out over Hillary, the DNC. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  You did. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  How do these people don't know me? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  They well, your answer says it all. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=149.6s)]
*  You just all but confirmed it with that reaction. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, if you saw her live in person, okay, it's different. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=155.48s)]
*  It's a different experience. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=159.16s)]
*  No, she's disgusting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=160.64s)]
*  It was a different experience. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=163.0s)]
*  In the speech at the convention way back in 2016, I said, you know, you can't trust somebody [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=164.0s)]
*  with nuclear weapons who you can bait with a tweet because I saw that in him at the time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=170.68s)]
*  A lot of people didn't or they gave him the benefit of the doubt or they thought, hey, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  you know, we've had two terms of a Democrat. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's try the Republicans for whatever reason. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=183.84s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=185.72s)]
*  But now the stakes are even higher because he has a record. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=187.36s)]
*  We have seen him try to abuse power. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  We have seen him try to overturn a legitimate free, fair election. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=196.62s)]
*  We have watched him bungle covid and cause unnecessary deaths and pain. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  So he has a record. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  And in addition to that, he's told us what he's going to do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=212.12s)]
*  He is absolutely linked to this project 2025 and all of their dark and dystopian efforts [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=215.24s)]
*  to turn the clock back on Americans rights and the way we live and how we, you know, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  look at our futures together. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=226.84s)]
*  And he has a long rhetorical record now of making it very clear. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  I will never forgive Donald Trump for not locking her up after saying he was going to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=235.72s)]
*  do that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think Republicans are not demanding more from their candidates. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  He kept saying, lock her up and then never did. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, then he then he walked it back. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=248.28s)]
*  Yeah. And then he now he said that I never did. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=250.0s)]
*  Yeah. Now he lies about it because he's such a god damn coward. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=252.64s)]
*  Lock her up. I really didn't. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=255.32s)]
*  Clear that he would be unaccountable if he were ever near the White House again. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=257.0s)]
*  There's like starmer bringing out Tony Blair and praising Thatcher only appeals the weird [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=262.84s)]
*  right wing freaks in the party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=266.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=267.76s)]
*  Should we word a column I have Liz Cheney and or Hillary Clinton in her cabinet? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=268.4s)]
*  Didn't she say she was going to put some? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=272.44s)]
*  She was going to put a Republican in there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=273.92s)]
*  Did Biden say that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=275.88s)]
*  And did he do that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=277.2s)]
*  That looks so there's more on it's probably who's responsible. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=278.6s)]
*  One role if you wouldn't mind. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=281.08s)]
*  That's so sweet of you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=283.36s)]
*  Send this man to Siberia. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=284.24s)]
*  Just one piece. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=286.0s)]
*  Three weeks into her presidential run was the first time Biden's campaign pollsters now [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=287.4s)]
*  hers held a deep dive with Kamala Harris's inner circle to discuss what she's been saying [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=291.32s)]
*  on the stump. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=294.92s)]
*  Over the line came a lot of praise. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=296.0s)]
*  But some suggested tweaks first said veteran Democratic numbers man Jeff Garan summarizing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=297.68s)]
*  their analysis. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=302.56s)]
*  Stop saying we're not going back. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  It wasn't focused enough on the future. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=304.76s)]
*  He argued second lay off all the weird talk to negative. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=309.28s)]
*  It's on your weird. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=309.64s)]
*  Wait what? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=310.68s)]
*  He said really great job. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=312.2s)]
*  They told them to back off of the weird talk. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=313.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=316.28s)]
*  Well this is the guy Jeff Garan on the Kamala Harris campaign. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=317.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  We need. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=323.24s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=323.76s)]
*  Dude these guys are these guys have the best instincts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=325.32s)]
*  That's why it's cool to just like keep letting Benjamin Netanyahu reign hell upon the entire [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=327.88s)]
*  region. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  Surely there will be no repercussions. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile the White House is also now trying to do regime change in Lebanon. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  Like they're so bro. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=341.64s)]
*  Worry about your own election dog. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=343.6s)]
*  You're about to get cooked. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=345.6s)]
*  Has Liz Cheney one of the people in politics ever looked at the horrible statement she's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=347.2s)]
*  made about lying Kamala Harris. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  The interview and policy is the exact opposite of what Cheney and her equally ridiculous [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=355.92s)]
*  father bro who got us into the never ending in the Middle East have stated over the years [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=360.88s)]
*  bro his running mate called him Hitler. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  I know but it doesn't matter. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=368.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=370.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=371.12s)]
*  He was groomed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=372.12s)]
*  He was groomed and he was groomed. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=373.12s)]
*  He was groomed and he's Adolf Hitler. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=374.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=376.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=377.0s)]
*  He was just a 35 year old man being groomed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=378.0s)]
*  But it's like they're being posted all over the Internet and Cheney looks even then I [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=379.64s)]
*  It's so funny because nobody likes the Cheney's. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Cheney's approval rating on his way out by the end of his second term was 13 percent. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=413.2s)]
*  Yeah Cheney is roundly despised by people who remember him. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=417.2s)]
*  Most people don't even know who he is. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=421.92s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=423.92s)]
*  But the people that do know who he is hate him. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=424.92s)]
*  And this does not just mean Democrats 13 percent Republicans as well. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=427.64s)]
*  Like everybody understands what Cheney did as he people mostly people with at least a [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=432.4s)]
*  Blame the responsibility of the Iraq and the Afghanistan and even maybe 9-11 depending [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=438.92s)]
*  on how far you want to go back directly on Cheney. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  Everybody hates George W. Bush too but they just seem as a mass a lovable mass and a winner [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=450.0s)]
*  in his own right. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  But Cheney is the mastermind behind the operation. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  So the reality of the matter is like he also is. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=458.42s)]
*  Yeah he did. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=462.24s)]
*  And then the guy apologized to him. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=463.24s)]
*  But like it's crazy because. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=464.64s)]
*  Sorry for getting in the way. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  He is such an evil piece of OK. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=468.2s)]
*  Such an evil piece of litany actively defended torture after he got out of office still continues [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=472.26s)]
*  to defend torture to this day. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  No constituency whatsoever. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=481.56s)]
*  And Kamala Harris is like oh we have disagreements but I really appreciate Cheney like Cheney [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  endorsing me is so especially because there are there is no one who this is for. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=490.2s)]
*  No one is like oh man Cheney is voting for Kamala. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=496.18s)]
*  Well I guess I am too. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=498.58000000000004s)]
*  Like that's not a thing that people think. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=500.18s)]
*  There's no Republican out there who thinks this way. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=502.42s)]
*  She is a radical liberal. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=505.18s)]
*  She's somebody that has said we ought to spend 32 trillion dollars on Medicare for all. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=507.26000000000005s)]
*  If you look at her record as well in California she did in fact essentially ban sales with [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=512.58s)]
*  executive action and she threatened during the primaries to do the same thing if she's [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=519.14s)]
*  elected if she if she were like. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=523.02s)]
*  Like how do you not understand Cheney endorsing Kamala Harris is like a reverse endorsement. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=525.3399999999999s)]
*  What do I mean by this. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=530.02s)]

*  in charge. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1THCM4kEe8&t=558.6600000000001s)]
