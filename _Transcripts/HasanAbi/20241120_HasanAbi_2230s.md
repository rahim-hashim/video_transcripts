# P2 The Shocking MAGA Couple Footage | Hasanabi & Austin Show Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4)
*  politics lock in on this couple. Yeah. No, we are currently watching. Yeah. Tell me about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=0.0s)]
*  them. They literally said things such as gay pride month of segregation. Women should not [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=6.96s)]
*  be able to vote. The woman said that in the couple. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. Oh, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=13.88s)]
*  this is crazy. I love it. They said all heterosexual intercourse that is done with contraceptives [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=17.96s)]
*  is actually gay sex and that and that infertile people should not even like have sex at all. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=27.16s)]
*  But it's but he was gracious enough to say I'll leave it up to the individual. All right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=34.8s)]
*  Let's watch these hogs. But who choose to so I didn't watch it from the jump yesterday, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=44.64s)]
*  I guess we could just continue where I left off. This is these are two of the dumbest people I've [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=53.080000000000005s)]
*  ever seen in my life. With one another. And for example, their whole friend group is black. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=58.6s)]
*  That's very different than as you mentioned. Yeah, I agree. I think lawful segregation, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=62.84s)]
*  or even advocating segregation. They do choose to segregate. This is something that they choose. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=67.88s)]
*  As time has gone on, people have been less and less segregated. There's like segregated. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=72.36s)]
*  This is the thing. People tend to get with people. And she said, dude, Republicans are awesome. God, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=77.68s)]
*  I love Republicans Fox News. I'm being sarcastic when I say God, I love Republicans. You know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=84.4s)]
*  don't don't write an article about sarcasm. We will we will sarcasm alert. I know that there's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=89.76s)]
*  like a bunch of neurodivergent reporters out there who don't understand context, nuance, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  or sarcasm. So I'm just giving you a tone indication, a manual tone indication. Okay. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=98.56s)]
*  Wait, what did you just say? No, I'm just saying like, I disagree with governments like segregation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=105.24s)]
*  You don't understand even the thing that you're so upset about. Pride is saying that your straight, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=109.32s)]
*  you know, more traditional, I don't even like saying that because I feel like that's disrespectful [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  to traditional Christians, but your version of traditional conservatism and Christianity, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=119.96s)]
*  that, you know, is yours to live. And then other people's lives are ours to live. And that's the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=126.35999999999999s)]
*  beauty of freedom. So where's our white pride month? Where's our Christian pride month? Where's, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=132.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't even want it. I don't even care. But like, you only see as the supposed [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=137.16s)]
*  oppressed groups. So whenever, yeah, they'll start because people are saying for too long. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  So you're saying if let's say I was raped by my boss for two and a half years, and I kept the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=146.76s)]
*  secret from my partner, even though my partner suspected something that was going on with boss, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=150.2s)]
*  but I kept denying. What are you saying? What I have no idea. What are you saying? Are you okay? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=153.96s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? Okay, let's continue. We've been pushed down. So we're going to do a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=161.16s)]
*  month to say that we are proud of who we are. No longer are we going to be shameful. It's so gay. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  That is literally gay. Literally. But every month that is like that is also gay. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  Like not even just gay pride month. Like also African American. What does that mean to you? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=175.24s)]
*  Just like, I'm just like, cringe. Like, you know, gay equals cringe. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=178.44s)]
*  you're having to not engage. Who knows what the hypothetical is. I have no idea what the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=182.6s)]
*  person was trying to say. And it is truly remarkable that he thought that I would [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=187.16s)]
*  understand what the fuck he was talking about. Sex and you can't reproduce. Like the best part [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=191.8s)]
*  about having sex is reproduction. Seriously. Like, I don't value sex because of an orgasm. I value [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  sex because I know that I am going to reproduce and have another baby. They're a couple, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=204.44s)]
*  God, he's so busted. Um, there is I was gonna make a, I was gonna make a joke about there [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  ain't no way he's getting pussy, but like, I think they're a couple. So I guess he did truly find [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=215.08s)]
*  someone stupid enough. Thing about the thing about Republicans is like, it just doesn't, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=221.0s)]
*  it's not about whatever standards they have for themselves. It has to be everybody else's problem. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=225.88000000000002s)]
*  It's just like, yeah, if you want to have the worst sex imaginable and not immediately and only [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=231.4s)]
*  do it for reproduction. I mean, I feel bad for you, but you know, go off. Why the fuck is that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=236.84s)]
*  anybody else's issue? Like what? Why are you setting the standards? And the same goes for gay [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=243.16s)]
*  shit, you know? Like it's not like gay people are running around being like, you have to be gay. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=248.68s)]
*  You have to suck a dick right now. And before everybody in the chat starts saying, no, I do say [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=253.16s)]
*  that. Okay. As a joke. That's not how this works. But conservatives, one, make it seem like it is, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=258.28s)]
*  act like it is, and then take action to stop people from being gay in general. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=264.84s)]
*  Maybe the orgasm aren't good enough. Kidding. Sorry. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=270.44s)]
*  Pain. I mean, like seriously though, like the best part of it's why as soon as we got together, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  like she's off birth control. As soon as we got married. As soon as we're together, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  it's like no birth control, nothing. Wait, what? So y'all are before marriage. What? Hello? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  Because I'm not going to have gay sex. And like gay sex is more than just like another man and a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  man. It's just like the idea of looking at sex is such a materialistic thing. And just like, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=298.84s)]
*  did he just say what I think he's he said having sex with our contraceptives is having sex with [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=304.84s)]
*  contraceptives is gay sex. He said, if you have fellas, if you, if you nut fellas, I guess pride [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  month is for everybody in that by that metric, everybody's gay as hell. Oh, well, like we just [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=318.28s)]
*  have an orgasm and that's fun or whatever. No, like, dude, sex is about having children. It's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=325.0s)]
*  about having babies. Like you are, you pump yourself full of birth control and then you have sex with [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=329.96s)]
*  your wife. And like, there's no purpose there except just pleasure. That's the only purpose. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=335.96s)]
*  Should people who are born like infertile have sex? It depends. Listen, I am pro like people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=341.72s)]
*  committing to celibacy for the rest of their life. I am pro like that. And if that was something that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=349.56s)]
*  they couldn't have babies, I believe that they should have that choice there. Well, they have [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=355.72s)]
*  a choice. Yeah, I'm saying that what you believe is correct. Infertile people, no sex for you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=361.0s)]
*  I think that I think that it's crazy. Infertile people don't think I don't see anybody really [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=367.16s)]
*  saying that, Hey, I'm infertile. So I'm going to be celibate for the rest of my life. I'm not going [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=372.76s)]
*  to touch sex. I'm not going to have sex. You think these crazy people don't say that? Yeah. Wow. I [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=375.72s)]
*  think that that would be very honorable. Very true. I agree. What I'm advocating for is for men to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=381.88000000000005s)]
*  take responsibility specifically with protection and with provision. And she's advocating for women [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  to submit and to serve their husbands. And oh, gross, dude, bro. She's going to poison him with [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=394.92s)]
*  Visine in a couple years. If no fault divorce is abolished. Okay, straight up back in the day [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=402.44s)]
*  when women couldn't get divorced from their partners for no particular reason, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  there was a suspicious amount of men just casually dying. Okay, so no fault divorce was actually for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=414.44s)]
*  the benefit of men too. This is the first time he's ever actually thought about any of this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=422.04s)]
*  I think this is the first time he's ever had a thought. And even then it's barely, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=426.36s)]
*  happening. How is she not miserable? Is she brainwashed? I mean, I don't think there's a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=431.08s)]
*  single thought behind either of their eyes. Okay. Remember, no one will support all women. Some of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=435.08s)]
*  you bros are dumb as hell. Okay. Like I'm not immediately going to sit here and be like, nah, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=441.4s)]
*  the person who earlier advocated for women not to be able to vote is actually a victim here. Okay. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=447.96s)]
*  We're all victims in that by that estimation. He's a victim of social conditioning as well. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=455.0s)]
*  Okay. Sorry. They're both, they're both victims in that same regard. But in this process, while I'm, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=460.6s)]
*  you know, analyzing the dumb shit that they're saying, I'm still going to make fun of both of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=466.68s)]
*  them. We're both, you know, that's what we agreed on. Like our vows, it was like, I vowed to protect [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=470.28s)]
*  and support, protect and provide and to love you. And she vowed to love me and support me always [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=476.04s)]
*  and to serve me. Yeah. But I'm not going to go saying we need to figure out how to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=482.6s)]
*  prevent couples like this. Instead, I'll just say people have the freedom to live the way they want [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=487.79999999999995s)]
*  to. And that's my point about this sort of one way street. But it's kind of like lukewarm. Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=493.0s)]
*  You're just giving a softer delivery, but you're still letting the public know your stance, what [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=497.88s)]
*  you think is better. I think equality is better for sure. We take a more harsh view of equality. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  What do you think equality is? Listen, are men and women equal? Yes. In what way? They're equal [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=506.91999999999996s)]
*  people, individuals, and they have the same individual rights. Okay. So basically they're [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=514.6s)]
*  equal because the government says they're equal because people through our democracy have made [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=519.88s)]
*  the government say they're equal. So the government basically gets to say that these people are equal [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=523.64s)]
*  because we give them rights because people are from God, not from the government. And then if [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=527.96s)]
*  you stop engaging with our government, you very quickly, it wasn't men and women were created [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=534.28s)]
*  equal. It wasn't that like our God given rights. Wait, what were like for equality for men and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=540.28s)]
*  women. That wasn't the point. Equality implies the same, the same rights. Yeah, dude. It's no, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=549.48s)]
*  look up, look up what equality is or being equal. Oh, the state of being equal, especially in status, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=555.24s)]
*  rights and opportunities. Look up more definitions, but look up more definitions [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=563.4s)]
*  for a 21 year old. He's pretty dumb. Not gonna lie. He's not just any 21 year old. He's a [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=569.32s)]
*  mega brain 21 year old. Okay. Is worse. It's on salvageable. Austin, you want to come [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=574.44s)]
*  watch this mag a couple. Are you staying here? Austin's in the building, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=581.48s)]
*  Austin show in a couple hours, we will be going on a journey and shooting the fear and podcast. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=589.08s)]
*  That's right. Austin is finally back from death's doorstep to bravely take on the next episode of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=596.76s)]
*  the fear and podcast. A lot to talk about. Maybe we can do the Asian dating sim together as well. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=605.72s)]
*  Anyway, the election really messed them up is true. It did them up. Good. Maybe it further [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=611.24s)]
*  vindicates you a symbolic expression of the fact that two quantities are equal in equation. That's [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=616.6s)]
*  obviously not helpful. That's math. You're big on welfare and things like that. Programs that are [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=622.84s)]
*  effective to help people. And you think that those are effective programs like social security, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=628.76s)]

*  family. A woman has premarital sex gets knocked up. What about I stand and then the government [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1299.48s)]
*  pays for it. They don't pay for it. They do. They give support to people who are coming on hard times. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1303.96s)]
*  What does give support mean? Paying for it. If they pay for it. What's the definition of giving [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1311.1599999999999s)]
*  support here? I mean, a dictionary. You're acting like everything is covered and you're living this. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1315.0s)]
*  You get free like baby care, like in the hospital delivery. You get a lot of support because I [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1320.12s)]
*  believe just like Jesus did that we should help people who are in tough situations. Right. But [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1325.56s)]
*  government incentivizes that. They don't care. Often when someone is a single mother trying to [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1330.9199999999998s)]
*  raise children, those kids are going to be malnourished if we don't give them some sort of [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1333.56s)]

*  where is decency? Well, these people used to be a party of decency. They don't give a fuck about [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1352.52s)]
*  decency, about education, about credibility. They don't give a fuck about it. So you need to stop [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1359.24s)]
*  trying to use and go through the system to work with these fucking people. They are demons. They [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1365.64s)]

*  First of all, you have to think of the word. You have to be nourished as a mother to give [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1437.08s)]
*  you good nourishment to your babies. And then the babies grow out of the sucking phase. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1444.92s)]
*  And then you still have to feed them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what I'm talking about. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1451.0s)]
*  Are we acting like people are not getting food? A lot of people, a large percentage of the US [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1455.72s)]
*  population is food insecure. Yeah. Meaning they get some food, but not enough to have a healthy [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1460.44s)]
*  nutritious diet because most of them are in poor environments. Really in America? In America. I [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1464.44s)]
*  see a lot of fat people. I don't know. Nice. What? Oh my God. Brain dead. No, like obesity is also [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1469.56s)]
*  going to be caused by malnutrition. Yes. What? No, show your phone. No, I know. No, I know. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1479.32s)]
*  In America. Very interesting. Yeah. I'm curious what these communities are. I think the point [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1485.8799999999999s)]
*  that he's trying- All sorts of communities. You mind if I eat? I'm saying where they are. Like all [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1491.24s)]
*  it's worse in red states because red states by almost every metric are worse. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1496.2800000000002s)]
*  Really? Yes. Like in- But at least they're going to go to heaven. What about the cities? What about [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1500.2800000000002s)]
*  the liberal cities? All the homelessness? LA? Like come on. Yeah. So a red state is only worse. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1504.92s)]
*  All I'm saying is, look, if God is real, if that's your thing, if that's your jam, if you believe in [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1509.4s)]
*  Jesus or whatever, then they're going- all these Republican politicians are going straight to hell. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1515.4s)]
*  Every single one of them. If that's your jam, that's all I'm saying. Even if you ascribe to that, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1521.8000000000002s)]
*  they're all going to hell. That's why I don't understand this shit. Even if you follow that, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1528.28s)]
*  even if that's your jam, if that's your thing, you're still going to hell. So what the fuck are you [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1533.16s)]
*  doing it for? What is this? I feel like to young women, unironically, they need to find a man that's [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1537.16s)]
*  very misogynistic. If you at all want to have a guy that's going to like make you follow his [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1543.88s)]
*  frame and you need to find a strong Christian man that's going to put you in your place, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1550.84s)]
*  or else you're going to dominate the relationship. And when a woman dominates the relationship, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1555.24s)]
*  it's destined for failure because I see even how I was different like in my previous relationship. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1559.8s)]
*  I was dominating and I was such a bitch, like such a Jezebel. And I wasn't always like a good [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1565.1599999999999s)]
*  wife or like this great- or even Christian. I used to be atheist, but he has completely [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1572.36s)]
*  transformed who I am and how I act because he's such a strong Christian man and he doesn't let me [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1577.96s)]
*  get by on things. He always will nitpick everything because he's literally training me how to be a [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1583.88s)]
*  good Christian wife. You need to be trained. Women are bitches and they need to be trained. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1589.48s)]
*  So that- Damn, sounds like abuse. She's such a dumb ass, dude. I'm just happy that two fucking [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1594.52s)]
*  idiots could find one another in this day and age like this. I need to grab my food real quick. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1600.52s)]
*  There's gotta be fetish. They're going to have even- She's not a dumb ass. She's abusing Gaslit. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1605.0s)]
*  Bro, you gotta have a little bit of accountability in this situation, okay? If you read this, please [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1609.96s)]
*  help me. Message me because I can't message you. What the fuck? Bro, I'm sorry. There is a- there [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1615.08s)]
*  is a point of- a point beyond like my charitability, okay? I think if you're actively making money [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1621.32s)]
*  off of like going on these whatever loser fucking Nazi shows to promote this lifestyle [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1628.36s)]
*  and advocate to be like ritualistically humiliated and abused and dominated, then yeah, we've moved [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1636.12s)]
*  past the point of me feeling bad for you, okay? We have. We've moved past it. I'm sorry. You will [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1641.8799999999999s)]
*  not be able to get me to feel bad and sit here and be like, well, that's a victim, you know? Like, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1648.12s)]
*  I do feel sometimes like people engage in this weird like radlib shit where they have this [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1654.28s)]
*  tendency to be like, nah, every woman is unconditionally a victim all the time. Like, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1662.28s)]
*  there's no need to infantilize. She knows what the fuck she's doing. That's a whole dumb ass. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1666.52s)]
*  That's my advice. Find a man that will train you. What's up, big dog? You want something? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1671.0s)]
*  You walk out until my point was conveyed that you do what you're supposed to do, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1675.0800000000002s)]
*  whatever I tell you to do, because that's your job is to submit, do it with a smile on your face. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1681.16s)]
*  I don't care. I wouldn't have let you leave. I would have, you know, you would have had to eat. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1686.8400000000001s)]
*  No, this is the same guy as the other clips. He just grew that ugly ass pub on his neck. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1692.0400000000002s)]
*  Never mean things I would have said. And then the job would have got done. And then afterwards, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1696.8400000000001s)]
*  after the cooling down process, I would have, you know, repented to God and smooth things over with [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1701.72s)]
*  you for the sinful behavior that I mean, that's how things would have went down. I wouldn't have [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1708.6s)]
*  let you walk out until Josiah and Isabella Moody explain how TradWive Christian submission works [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1715.32s)]
*  in practice. Basically, she has to take his emotional abuse with a smile on her face and [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1721.0s)]
*  eventually he'll repent to God for his sinful behavior. Can you question us on how much of [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1725.1599999999999s)]
*  this online hysteria and rage bait grifter stuff and how much is it actually IRL? I think there's [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1730.36s)]
*  worst versions of this in real life. Isabella Moody went viral for probably posting her video [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1735.24s)]
*  a video or her baby's in the end word. Here she is supporting Carrie Lake and Mara Logan wearing [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1740.52s)]
*  Carrie Lake badge. Who are these fucking losers? I didn't even know they existed. My daughter [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1745.72s)]
*  literally said the N word. I'm so proud of her. Oh, she's a Carrie Lake supporter. Yeah. That makes [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1750.92s)]
*  sense. My favorite. I love the Carrie Lake supporters talking about how the election was [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1755.72s)]
*  still for her exclusively. Yeah. Trump won the state, but it was wrong. I'm getting like really [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1760.92s)]
*  fucked vibes. I'm gonna be honest with you. Not only am I getting really fucked vibes from this, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1767.24s)]
*  but I feel like she dominates the relationship a lot more than she lets on. Okay. I feel like [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1772.76s)]
*  she knows what she's doing. There is bottom 100%. There is no, there's not a single thought behind [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1778.68s)]
*  those eyes. Okay. She is in control of this relationship. She is making it feel like he's [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1782.84s)]
*  in control. She knows what she's doing. Why do you have this right wing commentator on who? Austin? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1788.92s)]
*  Violent crime, worse poverty, et cetera. Worst infrastructure, worst education. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1794.28s)]
*  I would say the cities probably have no, no, it, um, this is okay. Well, because state governments [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1799.4s)]
*  structurally, systemically have a lot more say, I think the point that we're trying to make is that [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1805.96s)]
*  when the government incentivizes that's misogyny. Yeah. It's a misogyny to say that the, the woman [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1809.96s)]
*  in this relationship is like very clearly a lot smarter than the man. Poor rural red areas, right? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1816.28s)]
*  Where their food is. Yeah. Okay. So if a mother, if the, if the husband, for example, runs off, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1822.12s)]
*  let's say it's a, it's a happy couple and all of a sudden the husband runs off and then this, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1828.04s)]
*  this, uh, wife who was living a lifestyle, you wanted her to live. So she's not trained on [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1832.2s)]
*  anything. She can't go get a job easily. She needs to raise the kids is all of a sudden trying to [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1836.2s)]
*  figure out how to get a really low wage job because she's a single mother now or her husband dies. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1840.84s)]
*  Okay. She should join a church community and help there. Okay. Those are so [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1845.3200000000002s)]
*  healthy. I feel like I'm a little out of touch with, uh, like the commentary, it, you know, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1849.72s)]
*  the commentary space. Cause I think these people, these like little demons pop up on fucking [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1855.88s)]
*  tick tock, right? Is that what it is? Is that why I don't know who the fuck these people are? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1861.4s)]
*  Do people follow these people? Yeah. It seems like there's like hella fucking videos of them [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1865.48s)]
*  on right wing watch and like all these other people, like I've never even heard these motherfuckers [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1869.72s)]

*  this like massive fucking area is genuinely dire for the future of America. I don't understand how [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1902.12s)]
*  young people are inspired by this. They are direct friends with Nick. This framing of women are [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZUJowkU-X4&t=1909.08s)]
