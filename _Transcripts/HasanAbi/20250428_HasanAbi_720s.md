# Why Canadian Politics Is Broken Too | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw)
*  So I'm sure border French Canadians listen, I'm a, I'm at, I'm generally in support of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=0.0s)]
*  all anti-imperialist indigenous movements. Okay. And the Francophone Canadians, as we [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=6.88s)]
*  all know are indigenous to the land. As a matter of fact, they need to have a separate [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=12.56s)]
*  category. They've been screwed over even worse than the first nation Canadians. Okay. The [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=17.68s)]
*  greatest crime. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=26.32s)]
*  Tories blew a 20 point lead. NEP collapse, but might flip a couple of writings. NDP and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=32.36s)]
*  Tory leader writings are up for grabs. They never even had a chance because the FET, the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=36.16s)]
*  federal NDP let the liberals take up the anti-Trump torch. Yeah. Canadian duopoly is upon us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=40.64s)]
*  New brunswick is a tiny promise and historically extremely anti-union anti-labor because it's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  basically owned by an oil company Irving. Like literally Irving owns almost every print [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=50.36s)]
*  outlet. I mean, there's 30 more minutes until we figure out the figure out what happens, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=54.12s)]
*  right? All the polls close. It is 9 PM Eastern time. And we are live from the atrium at the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Toronto broadcasting center for 36 days. Federal leaders did their best to sell their visions [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  of the future to Canadians. It all comes down to this. I'm Rosemary. I mean, this is literally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=68.96s)]
*  this is yet another indication of Canada status as America's had low key, but not even low [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  high key. And what I mean by that is because Trump literally Trump gave a ginormous w to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=81.4s)]
*  the liberals by behaving in the way that he does by creating nationalist sentiment in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=88.4s)]
*  a country like Canada that rallied around the flag of the liberal party. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=95.16s)]
*  Obviously Trudeau was insanely unpopular. So any kind of fresh face that you could slap [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=101.68s)]
*  on that's like remotely competent that hasn't been ripped apart by a reactionary media was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  going to be much more favorable. And his approval ratings, like the approval rates of the liberal [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=114.76s)]
*  party skyrocketed as a consequence of polar bears allegiance, seemingly to the, to the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=120.8s)]
*  growing reactionary right-wing movement in America. And is in his initial allegiance [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=129.86s)]
*  before Donald Trump started talking about how Canada is actually a part of America is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=134.88s)]
*  the, is the 51st state ended up, ended up cooking them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=138.16s)]
*  A huge amount of data and a huge amount of votes from Quebec all the way over to Alberta [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=142.32s)]
*  and two territories. That round of votes will come fast and furious and things will start [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=147.92s)]
*  to have a policy called polar bear direction of this country going here, polar bear there [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=153.24s)]
*  though, at the bottom of your screen, that is where we are at now with Atlantic Canada [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=157.84s)]
*  results coming in 22 leading and elected for the liberals, conservatives at 10 and the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=161.96s)]
*  Bloc Québécois at one. And that's because only one Quebec riding has closed at this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=167.2s)]
*  hour. And that's my ghost. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  Gaspésie, Hilda, Madeleine. Okay. We do want to show you one person who was reelected [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=172.64s)]
*  and that is Dominic LeBlanc reelected in the riding of Beau Sejour. As I said, handily [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  for Dominic LeBlanc, of course, a cabinet minister under Mark Carney right now. And [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  there he is tonight. Dominic LeBlanc. Thanks for joining us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=189.92s)]
*  Quebec needs to separate. Hi, Rosemary. Thank you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Good to see you. First of all, I want to ask you about where the Liberal Party is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=195.04s)]
*  at coming out of Atlantic Canada here, leading or elected. We've got you at 22, the conservatives [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  at 10. Those weren't quite the numbers that we understood that the liberals wanted to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=205.36s)]
*  see at this stage of the evening. I think that's fair, but there are a lot of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=209.52s)]
*  votes still to be counted. I've been looking at some of the results in some of the New [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=213.84s)]
*  Brunswick or Nova Scotia ridings and there are still a lot of polls to be counted. And [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=218.16s)]
*  my experience tells me often the polls that are slow to come in are the ones where there was a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=223.2s)]
*  very heavy turnout in some advanced polls or other big turnouts on election day today. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=229.2s)]
*  So I'm a, I'm a, I'm generally in support of all anti-imperialist indigenous movements. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=234.96s)]
*  Okay. And the Francophone Canadians, as we all know, are indigenous to the land. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=244.96s)]
*  As a matter of fact, they need to have a separate category. They've been screwed over even worse [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=250.56s)]
*  than the first nation Canadians. Okay. The greatest crime. That's why I'm in favor of, of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=255.12s)]
*  the Cuba, a separatist movement. They are the legacy Canadians. As a matter of fact, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=265.12s)]
*  they should overtake the entirety of Canada and force every Canadian to speak French all the time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=272.16s)]
*  No more Anglophone Canada. Why am I saying all of this? When basically last year I was making fun [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  of Le Bloc. Why am I? Because Denis Villeneuve, I found out that he's French Canadian. I found [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=284.56s)]
*  out that he's a Quebec L, which is why my attitude shifted. I'm sorry. That's how easy it is to sell [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=294.56s)]
*  me. Okay. Now feel now Felix Langiel, the lion of level is also a, you know, he is also a French, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=301.44s)]
*  the French Canadian, which is why I was, I was maintaining the position that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=313.28s)]
*  I was maintaining an anti-Cubaker stance, but my attitude has shifted now because of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=324.48s)]
*  Denis Villeneuve. You're right. We should, we should ask ourselves what that means in some of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=331.44s)]
*  the bigger provinces like Ontario or even British Columbia. I did notice there, Dominic LeBlanc, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=336.08s)]
*  that you use the M word. You use the word majority. Do you, is that an expectation, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  a real expectation for you tonight? Why is Jeffrey Sachs glazing Mark Carney? That's weird. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=344.96s)]
*  That was quietly and Canada's not going down. Oh, it's his student. Oh God. Oh no. And my student, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=350.0s)]
*  Mark Carney, who's now a prime minister of Canada said today, no, Canada remains Canada. Don't even [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=358.48s)]
*  think about it. And I believe him. And I think he's going to probably remain prime minister also [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  in view of the upcoming psychological warfare that that's going to come. And Canada's not going [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  down quietly. And my student, Mark Carney has been glazed by every Neil live in the Western world. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=386.96s)]
*  Yeah. Which is why I'm shocked that Jeffrey Sachs is also glazing him. I thought Jeffrey Sachs was [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=392.96s)]
*  no longer the annoying. He, he normally is pretty good, but Jeffrey Sachs is a, is a academic who [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=399.12s)]
*  is perhaps most responsible for shock doctrine in the dissolution of the USSR who changed his ways [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=408.96s)]
*  and has become an outspoken anti-imperialist. This was riding and the St. John's East riding. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=415.68s)]
*  So those are still in play. Part of the problem is this, we have more than 70% of the vote counted [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=420.8s)]
*  in Newfoundland and Labrador. We've just hit the 50% mark and Prince Edward Island. And we're below [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=426.0s)]
*  50% in New Brunswick, sorry, in Nova Scotia and only just over a third of the vote counted in [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  New Brunswick. So it makes it very difficult to call some of the writings when you're still, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=436.48s)]
*  didn't Mark Carney also say that like, we're going to stop Israel or some shit. Am I crazy? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=440.8s)]
*  Did I hallucinate and then immediately back away from that position day about Israel? He said, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=445.12s)]
*  well, recently he also said condemning is really blockade on food, but that doesn't really mean [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=451.2s)]
*  anything, but I'm pretty sure he called it a genocide. And then very quickly backtracked. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=455.2s)]
*  Like that was for a brief moment said he didn't hear the word genocide. Canada is against Israel [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=459.92s)]
*  and the country is against Israel. Brother. Oh brother. Oh brother. There's no country in the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=466.08s)]
*  Western world that is actually like, and their politicians is actually against Israel with the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  exception of Ireland. Okay. Let me tell you, okay. You are sipping awesome. Cool. You're down in some [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=477.12s)]
*  cool. Oh, Spain, Spain. True, true, true. Spain say Spain is one exception and the French [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=484.24s)]
*  federal debate jugman Singh challenges Mark Carney on Gaza. Why don't you call things as they are? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=493.2s)]
*  This is a genocide. Carney claims that the term politicizes the situation. We know that if you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=496.88s)]
*  can't name a genocide, you definitely won't stop it. South Africa. We're calling South Africa, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=501.44s)]
*  a Western nation. Now that's crazy. I didn't know that. I I've had no idea. I didn't, I didn't know [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=506.24s)]
*  the dynamics should change this dramatically. And this rapidly what's next. What's another [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=513.36s)]
*  Western nation that's anti-Israel Brazil, just countries in the global South also Western. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=518.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Diana. I'm aware. This is why we have an arms embargo. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=527.76s)]
*  Oh, and then he came out and was like, Oh, it's not a genocide. I didn't hear that. He said [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=537.68s)]
*  genocide. That's what happened. Right. Last night at the rally, there was a [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=541.84s)]
*  protester who was hard to hear. I believe said there's a genocide in Gaza. One of the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=547.28s)]
*  first protester that interrupted your speech said there's a genocide in Gaza. And I believe your [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=554.48s)]
*  response was I'm aware. That's why there's an arms embargo. So I just wanted to clarify what you heard [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=559.6s)]
*  if you said I'm aware. What were you being aware of? Would you are you proceeding? It's a genocide [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=567.28s)]
*  in Gaza. I didn't hear that. Actually. I didn't hear that word is that you were, you were there, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=572.8s)]
*  I guess. And yeah, man, these guys are so afraid. They're so scared, dude. Holy shit here and pick [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=577.04s)]
*  up ground here because the chances for targets are narrow on the prairies and in the North. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=583.12s)]
*  And then a whole lot could be riding on British Columbia, but they just personally demanded [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  a retraction because the CBC decision desk has projected elected Joanne Thompson in the riding [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  of St. John's East, the fisheries minister in the Mark Carney government. And then the last liberal [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  incumbent to seek reelection is returning to Ottawa. And the CBC's Carolyn Stokes is standing [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=606.64s)]
*  by at Joanne Thompson's headquarters. Carolyn, take it away. Hi, David. Yes, I'm hearing that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=612.08s)]
*  CBC is projecting that Joanne Thompson has held on to her seat. But actually, not many people here in [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=618.4s)]
*  the room have heard that yet. We had no reaction to this yet. So no cheering or anything. So we're [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=624.32s)]
*  just here we go. OK, so this from very, very happy people here. We're expecting Joanne Thompson to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  come out now and give a speech. Lots of silly and pretty good showing it looks for Joanne Thompson [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  tonight, holding on to the seat, heading back to Ottawa and with not as many liberal colleagues [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=649.2s)]
*  from this province as before because of the loss in Long Range Mountains and at Clippert Small, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=658.96s)]
*  holding on to his seat. So yeah, this is the situation here in St. John's East. A lot of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=666.08s)]
*  happy people. David. All right, Carolyn, thank you very much. Joanne Thompson beating David Brazzell, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=674.1600000000001s)]
*  a former leader of the Provincial Conservative Party, Mary Shortall, the president of the NDP. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CXwgrT1Aw&t=679.9200000000001s)]
