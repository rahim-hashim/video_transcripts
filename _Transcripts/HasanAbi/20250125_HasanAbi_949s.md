*  That's why everyone was saying Hassan Caroline's Caroline's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=279.86s)]
*  camera quality is better than yours. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  That's because we were underground two floors when the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  camera was filming this and Caroline was above ground. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=290.86s)]
*  That's probably the reason why so the very fact that it was [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=294.66s)]
*  like legible and didn't F at all. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=297.66s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  No, you were in the exact spot. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=301.86s)]

*  Don't worry. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=316.86s)]
*  I'm do I do the couch stretches. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=317.16s)]

*  No, Caroline's was way better than yours is for some reason. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  Huh? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=329.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=329.76s)]
*  I don't know what that's about. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  John electronic into father founder was arrested entering Switzerland. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=331.56s)]

*  We're we're now in a new place. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=338.26s)]
*  I think in terms of European fascism. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=339.96000000000004s)]

*  What were you camera? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=345.66s)]
*  Caroline's gamma or whatever was brighter. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  So it was clear even in the gym. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=348.66s)]
*  I think it might have been a camera difference too. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=350.06s)]
*  Anyway, where was I? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z5FVyRdRJw&t=352.26s)]
