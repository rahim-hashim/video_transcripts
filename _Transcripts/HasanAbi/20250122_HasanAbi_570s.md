# The End Of The Left + Liberal Alliance | HasanAbi Reacts to Joshua Citarella
**HasanAbi:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I)
*  He's like, I'm, I'm right here. I love the democratic party. I will unconditionally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=0.0s)]
*  defend the democratic party. Anyway, funny too, how they don't realize that if you got [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=5.04s)]
*  paid by the dams, he was simultaneously lose all credibility and potential reach across the aisle. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=8.48s)]
*  Anyway, I mean, it's not even, I don't even care about that. Like if the democratic party was, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=11.92s)]
*  was, you know, doing I've, I've often said that I want to be the propaganda minister. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=17.84s)]
*  Okay. I want to be regime-pilled. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=24.88s)]
*  I want to see what Will had to say about the end of the left plus liberal. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=32.64s)]
*  To be like their candidate and then replacing him with Kamala Harris, who [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  right side that's being committed now. Who I think got a brief honeymoon of period of people, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=41.2s)]
*  like people just being like, oh, we don't have to vote for Joe Biden. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=48.64s)]
*  She got about a meme news cycle. She's Brad, but then it was just, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=51.76s)]
*  I mean, I think what it comes down to, like, I mean, like the easiest explanation is her and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=55.92s)]
*  the democratic party that the infrastructure around her don't actually believe in anything. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=61.76s)]
*  I mean, well, they do believe in certain things like, you know, supporting Israel and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=66.56s)]
*  wall street and they're, they're, you know, like they're, they're donors, but like they essentially [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=72.64s)]
*  don't believe in anything. And like, and you see a lot of that now in the sort of postmortems or [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  people are just, they're stuck on this idea of messaging. You know, we got like our messaging [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=81.52s)]
*  is better or like, you know, we need 10,000 Hassan Piker's and like the message follows the policy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=85.92s)]
*  And if you don't have a thousand Hassan Piker's, yeah, let a thousand Hassan Piker's. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  They just think like, if we can only have a son Piker with our politics, then like, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=97.84s)]
*  then we'd have the perfect vessel for our message. And the answer is like, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=103.92s)]
*  Hassan wouldn't be Hassan if he had the politics of, you know, to save America. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=107.44s)]
*  Right. They essentially ran this election as a campaign. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=112.0s)]
*  I mean, he's right. It was just ironic. Cause like, that's kind of the point I made as well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=116.64s)]
*  It's simply not a matter of like, you know, flooding the market with pro-liberal sentiment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=121.84s)]
*  And although those interviews were blasted virtually everywhere, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=130.72s)]
*  okay. In all, in virtually every single outlet mainstream outlet that covered it, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=137.6s)]
*  absolutely zero people understood what I was saying. They were like, hey man, can we give [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=144.4s)]
*  you some money? You'll be the Joe Rogan of the left, please. This seems like a great idea. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=148.32s)]
*  And I was like, there is no, that's not how this works. I said that in every single interview that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  was done. Meanwhile, on the sidelines, apparently there was another guy who in between [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=158.08s)]
*  sending sex tapes that he had sometimes consensually and other times, unconsensually filmed, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=165.36s)]
*  sending those sex tapes without the consent of other parties that were involved in the sex tapes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=171.28s)]
*  He was sitting around getting angry that he was not being presented as the Joe Rogan of the left. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  He's like, I'm, I'm right here. I love the democratic party. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  I will unconditionally defend the democratic party. Anyway, funny too, how they don't realize [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=183.36s)]
*  if you got paid by the dams, he was simultaneous. He lose all credibility and potential reach across [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  the aisle. Anyway, I mean, it's not even, I don't even care about that. Like if the democratic party [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=192.08s)]
*  was, was, you know, doing I've, I've often said that I want to be the propaganda minister. Okay. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=198.08s)]
*  I want to be regime pill. I want to be regime pill. I want to be a loyal servant of this party. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=206.08s)]
*  The issue on the other hand is in order for that to happen, they have to actually do something [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=212.48s)]
*  that's worth defending. Doesn't seem like it's going to happen anytime soon though. Would you, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  could you be China pill? I already am. If, if China did, I mean, if the American government did [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=233.6s)]
*  half of the good things, not the bad, because we're only doing the bad things that the Chinese [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=240.64s)]
*  government does in terms of like curbing free speech or, you know, wholesale trying to ban [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=245.2s)]
*  applications that don't abide by American messages. Like we're just doing our institutions only take [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  the bad of Chinese governance and try to apply it here. And none of the good stuff, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  what they also fail to recognize is a lot of the restrictive things that the Chinese government does [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=263.68s)]
*  only works if you're doing the good stuff as well. That's the reality of more controlling and more [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=272.16s)]
*  authoritarian. I'm not saying the Chinese government is authoritarian, but like more [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  authoritarian, like overtly controlling governance is that the people know that they can't say [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=282.72s)]
*  certain things. So the, the permission structure of permissible speech is apparent. People know [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=289.84s)]
*  what you can't say and people know what you can't say. People know that they're being propagandized [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=298.48s)]
*  to. When you know that you're being propagandized to, you will revolt if all the other stuff is not [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  working. The American government is now going to do all of the bad controlling stuff, controlling [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=307.84s)]
*  speech stuff, and none of the good stuff that comes along with it. And against Donald Trump, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=313.12s)]
*  who's like, you know, the most dangerous man who's ever existed in American history. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  But they really did also run a campaign against their own base. And they ran a campaign to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=322.56s)]
*  essentially demoralize their own base on behalf of this like, it's not a dumb ass take to say all [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=329.12s)]
*  governments are authoritarian. What are you talking about is a structure of authority. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=335.28s)]
*  By definition, every rule that is written, whether it makes sense or not, is still restricting people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  that would technically want to, you know, violate that standard violate that rule. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=349.68s)]
*  That's it. That's how it works. The point is, or the goal is rather to make sure that the rules [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=355.68s)]
*  that are set are sensible. I didn't know you were an anarchist. No, my difference in opinion on the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=361.36s)]
*  matter is that there are plenty of sensible rules and standards. I'm not inherently against it is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=367.44s)]
*  my point. Do you see what I'm saying? That's the big difference, I guess. And I'm not even inherently [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=373.44s)]
*  in favor of democratizing every aspect of that process. Like an imaginary like tranche of voters [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=378.56s)]
*  that existed on their spreadsheets. And I think we can- Why is that imaginary voter? Like, you know, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=385.12s)]
*  the moderate voter or the Republican voter that's seen a voter Republican their whole life, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=392.32s)]
*  but is uncomfortable with Donald Trump because of, you know, January 6, or Russia, or blah, blah, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=396.32s)]
*  blah, the list goes down. It's just like a campaign for anyone but, I don't know, like, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=401.92s)]
*  they're the base. They're like, you know, anyone like liberal progressive or a young person in [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=407.84s)]
*  this country. And it didn't give people anything to vote for. And why would anyone vote for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=413.28s)]
*  Republican light when the full fat version is on offer and half the price? So I mean, I think [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=418.96s)]
*  that's really what it comes down to. Like, the Democrats didn't offer anything to anyone. They [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=425.52s)]
*  don't believe in anything. And say what you will about Donald Trump. Can you prove any sensible [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  rules, dog? There's no basis for authority to exist other than its own assertion. No, dude. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=433.68s)]
*  Take a shower. Okay. Take a shower. Take a shower. Please, right now. Turn off the broadcast. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  Go to your bathroom. Clean it up first because there's probably crust all over it. And take [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  a shower. Chatters be like, I don't understand. Why is there any standards for what kind of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=455.28s)]
*  meat in our meat supply is allowed? I would like to get trichinosis, please. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  Like, what do you what do you mean, dude? What do you mean sensible rules? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=469.28s)]
*  All there is no basis for authority to exist other than its own assertion. All rules are [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  there should be no safety standards. I say no, it's not an accidental libertarian. It's an anarchist. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=480.56s)]
*  He's coming in from the anti nap time coalition. An unjustifiable hierarchy has been presented [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=486.0s)]
*  on top of me. My maternal unit is enforcing the violent standard, violent standard [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=494.24s)]
*  of which she maintains the monopoly on by forcing me to go to sleep. Sir, a second hierarchy just [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=501.2s)]
*  hit. It's my four year old. He got a Twitch account somehow. That's good anarchist parenting, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=510.32s)]
*  allowing your child to get a Twitch account. Donald Trump has signed an order, redesignating [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=515.68s)]
*  on Sala Allah, the who has a foreign terrorist organization. This designation was placed on [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=522.72s)]
*  the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=527.36s)]
*  Trump administration was lifted when Biden took office because it was impeding the delivery of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=529.2s)]
*  humanitarian aid after the October seven attacks. Biden designated on Sala Allah is [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=533.5200000000001s)]
*  especially designated global terrorists, which is a different designation from foreign terrorist [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  organization. One of the key differences is that the FTO criminalizes material support [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=542.0s)]
*  of organizations designated as terror organizations. FTO is broader and more punitive while the SDGT [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=546.6400000000001s)]
*  is narrower and targets financial and logistical aspects. Thank God. Thank God these goddamn evil [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=552.48s)]
*  demons are getting was what? Anyway, yeah, he ended DEI. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Hw9t_h1I&t=560.4s)]
