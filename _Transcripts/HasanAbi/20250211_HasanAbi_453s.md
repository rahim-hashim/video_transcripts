# Hasan's Struggles In Returning To Normal Life After His Trip To Japan
**HasanAbi:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY)
*  But the problem with basketball is like if you don't consistently keep up with it even if you do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=0.0s)]
*  other cardio like I did in Japan I did a bunch of other stuff right it still doesn't matter it's not good enough. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=5.44s)]
*  I'm trying to I'm trying to get back into it I'm trying to get back into the post [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=16.88s)]
*  um in post Japan I'm trying to get back into my old habits of you know doing a decent diet [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=21.92s)]
*  and also getting into a decent diet situation while also simultaneously getting back on my [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=30.0s)]
*  cardio the hardest part the hardest part has been cardio for the most part isn't Galvijim healthy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=38.72s)]
*  for you no sips coke this isn't coke this coffee um the hardest part is that the hardest part for me [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  has basically been the cardio situation you know the cardio situation is really really [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=54.72s)]
*  uh difficult overall because like in terms of basketball is so it's so damn hard to to get back [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=62.72s)]
*  to your regular breathing your regular cardio even if you even if you just like let go for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=70.56s)]
*  let go for two weeks any tips on getting into cardio the easiest tip is to find something that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=78.56s)]
*  you enjoy find something that you enjoy like I did with basketball and just really spam it [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=85.12s)]
*  that's what I do I spam basketball but the problem with basketball is like if you don't [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  consistently keep up with it even if you do other cardio like I did in Japan I did a bunch of other [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=96.72s)]
*  stuff right it still doesn't matter it's not good enough like there's a dude I ball with and he cooked [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  me today I beat him once and he beat me twice so in a game of three he technically won and the only [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=107.76s)]
*  reason why that happened is because I just don't have the same stamina you know that's directly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=114.64s)]
*  because I just haven't played basketball for the past two weeks so I just got to get back into it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=119.36s)]
*  also it's official Kaia cannot do fetch like I when I sent her back to to boarding [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=126.0s)]
*  to refresh her training I told the guy I was like can you please get her to also play fetch [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=134.08s)]
*  because it's the easiest way for me to wear her out that's what I used to do with fish and he [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=139.36s)]
*  basically threw the towel he was like she has no she doesn't have like a lot of prey drive she just [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=146.0s)]
*  is a very independent lady and when she goes out to the park she only likes to she only likes to do [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=152.08s)]
*  the things that she wants to do and she just does not want to play fetch when she's out in the park [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=162.0s)]
*  like at home she'll play fetch all day every day it's crazy at home she plays fetch but at the park [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=168.16s)]
*  she's like nope I want to play I want to play with other dogs I want to beat the shit out of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=174.72s)]
*  other dogs like you know not seriously but in a play fight and she's very good at play fighting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=179.12s)]
*  but she just refuses to play fetch which cooks me because when I don't have because I don't have enough [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=185.52s)]
*  like I don't have enough time I can't I can't just like hope that there is like other dogs that she [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=195.84s)]
*  would want to play with that will also play with her every time I go to the park you know what I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnUhnTI9GMY&t=201.52s)]
