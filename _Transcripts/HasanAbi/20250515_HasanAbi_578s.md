# Zelensky Begged For Peace | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA)
*  There's nothing funnier than all of the Z pushers being like Russia wants a ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia actually wants a ceasefire and it's actually zill Disney who's not [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=6.22s)]
*  allowing a ceasefire to take place to now have to turn around and be like actually, you know, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  obviously if a ceasefire took place then [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=17.76s)]
*  Ukraine will have the capacity to re up and rear arm like it's obvious that America has no interest in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=20.96s)]
*  Here let's talk about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=30.96s)]
*  Jeted into the Turkish capital Ankara to show the world he was we are at the table [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=32.96s)]
*  We are the table. Okay, Turkey once again, not just at the table, but literally the table. Okay, Turkey is the table if [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=37.36s)]
*  Russia's leader did the same [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=45.04s)]
*  But as he arrived it was clear that it would be a no-show from his nemesis [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=47.24s)]
*  President Zelensky's kind use do you have a message for Vladimir Putin a? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=56.0s)]
*  Meeting with president Erdogan was a chance to talk next steps and increase the pressure on the Russian damn out of the one [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=58.88s)]
*  Looks like shit, bro. He looks way older. He looks way older than before [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=65.84s)]
*  Goddamn, how old is out of the one now? How do they want age? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=71.52s)]
*  71 years old damn [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  Consideration [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=78.52s)]
*  Consideration to on how to engage with the low-level delegation the Kremlin had sent to Turkey [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  By coming to Turkey and effectively daring Vladimir Putin to do the same [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=87.92s)]
*  President Zelensky is sending a message to the world and in particular the American administration of Donald Trump [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=93.28s)]
*  That Ukraine is not the barrier to peace [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=99.36s)]
*  He's trying to galvanize international opinion around the view that it is Russia that is stalling the peace process [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=102.62s)]
*  In Istanbul amidst high security the press waited for those talks to get underway [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=109.98s)]
*  With Ukraine accusing Moscow of not being serious calling the peace talks team theatrical [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=116.58s)]
*  I think that the Kremlin leader should show his leadership if he's ready for negotiations. Let's meet [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=125.38s)]
*  Without any preconditions whatever he wants. Let's meet [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=132.06s)]
*  We're in Ankara in Turkey. We arrived here then we're sending our group to Istanbul [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=136.26s)]
*  He's not here. He's not in Istanbul. Most of these are not really run around the world looking for him [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=141.7s)]
*  I believe the United States and Turkey are currently feeling disrespected by Russia in my opinion [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=147.3s)]
*  I'm not I'm gonna keep it a buck 50. I don't think Vladimir Putin gives a shit about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=155.18s)]
*  disrespecting Turkey right now [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=163.06s)]
*  Okay, you know [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=165.02s)]
*  After what Ardoin did after the fucking shit out of the one pulled in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=166.9s)]
*  Syria at the behest of the United States of America's interest in the region [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=173.74s)]
*  I don't think Vladimir Putin cares about Turkey being a mediator in this conflict [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=179.5s)]
*  Okay, that's it. There's only I mean you you can give [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=185.3s)]
*  Ukraine all the by doctors on the planet. Okay, fucking rip through the Russian forces on the ground, but [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=190.18s)]
*  also on top of that when you turn around and you when you dismantle a a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=198.82s)]
*  Warm water port for your military for your Navy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=206.17999999999998s)]
*  By by handing it over to American interest. I feel like you know, I don't think Vladimir Putin cares that much about [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=210.82s)]
*  Turkey or [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=219.78s)]
*  hurting Ardoin's feelings [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  The Americans had hoped for much from these talks [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=225.42s)]
*  But Trump on a tour of the Middle East is playing down the lack of success [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  I haven't even checked. Nothing's gonna happen until Putin and I get together [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=235.54s)]
*  Okay, and obviously he wasn't gonna go he was gonna go but he thought I was gonna go [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=240.78s)]
*  He wasn't going if I wasn't there and the girls dude [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=245.54s)]
*  The girlies he wasn't gonna go if I'm not going so now I'm not going cuz he's not going we're not going [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=249.62s)]
*  Turkey no longer at the table. Guess where the table is Turkey Riyadh [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=256.94s)]
*  Riyadh that's where the table is believe me [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=262.1s)]
*  Vladimir no, I told him I told him Vladimir. No, I used to call him out of the goat [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=265.70000000000005s)]
*  Now I call him out of the or nope. I will choke nausea people not even I know I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=271.74s)]
*  Don't believe anything's gonna happen with you like it or not until he and I get together [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=277.26000000000005s)]
*  But we're gonna have to get it solved because too many people are dying and at the Kremlin it was clear [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=281.5s)]
*  There was he don't give up dude. That's the problem [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  Too many people are dying too many people are dying. It's like yeah, he knows I don't think he gives a shit [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  He it just looks like he's very comfortable in his position currently like [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  There's no sign Putin was feeling the need to get on a plane [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=300.1s)]
*  His negotiating team in Istanbul talking up the process [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=303.98s)]
*  But his foreign minister launching this attack [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=308.62s)]
*  At first Zelensky was making some statements demanding that Putin come in person. He is a pathetic man [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=314.18s)]
*  Everybody understands except perhaps himself and those who control him [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=320.62s)]
*  Is a chip was not a dream [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=325.42s)]
*  Why is a ceasefire needed to pump Ukraine up so it can prepare to negotiate from a position of strength? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=326.94s)]
*  There's nothing funnier than all of the z-pushers being like Russia wants a ceasefire [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  Russia actually wants a ceasefire and it's actually zil Disney [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  Who's not allowing a ceasefire to take place to now have to turn around and be like actually, you know [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=342.66s)]
*  obviously if a ceasefire took place then [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=350.38s)]
*  Ukraine will have the capacity to re-up and rearm like it's obvious that America has no interest in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=353.54s)]
*  Re-upping and rearming Ukraine. Let's be real. Okay. No the real posture here is that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=359.38000000000005s)]
*  the real posture here is that Adolf Pootler or also known as Vladimir poo [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=366.66s)]
*  recognizes that he has the upper hand in these negotiations because the primary party the primary [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=373.62s)]
*  Negotiator here is the United States of America and until the United States of America [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=380.29999999999995s)]
*  Wants to mediate the conflict with Russia and China [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=385.73999999999995s)]
*  there, you know, he could just sit on he could just sit on eastern Ukrainian territory and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=390.02s)]
*  Take advantage of the stalemate that took place [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=395.97999999999996s)]
*  especially considering that America's ceasefire negotiations are [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=398.5s)]
*  Like the terms of said negotiations are so favorable to Vladimir Putin so insanely favorable to the fact that he's not taking it [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=402.53999999999996s)]
*  I assume implies that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=409.46000000000004s)]
*  He just you know, he's just waiting out for something else. I don't know Lavrov should retire [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=411.62s)]
*  He's been working since the USSR was still a thing. He's so terrifying [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=417.1s)]
*  I think there's a real advantage to using a Frankenstein's monster looking ass like Lavrov in these negotiations [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=420.18s)]
*  you know, it's really funny is [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=426.14s)]
*  Every step of the way when I demanded a ceasefire when I when I was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=428.86s)]
*  Criticizing the Biden administration for not coming to the table to engage with a ceasefire when Ukraine had a leverage for example [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=432.46000000000004s)]
*  What did the what did the pro-ukrainian accounts say every single time all the liberals were like a son? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=438.14s)]
*  You're pro-russia has on your pro-russia because if there is a ceasefire all of Russia is going to do is re up and rearm [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=444.65999999999997s)]
*  And now Russia is saying the same shit. What happened? What happened? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=450.1s)]
*  The failure of the first direct talks in three years to make much progress means the conflict and the killing in Ukraine continues [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=455.82s)]
*  This the site of an attack on the city of Sumi [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=464.62s)]
*  There is still a flicker of hope that the peace process can gain some momentum [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=468.18s)]
*  But at the moment the war I'm telling you right now ten years down the line if [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=473.21999999999997s)]
*  Zelensky is not dead [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=478.78s)]
*  Okay [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=480.34s)]
*  Or even someone close within his orbit is going to do a tell-all where they will say that during the Antalya peace talks [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=480.86s)]
*  Where there was a 15-point plan that was designed and was at the table? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=489.62s)]
*  That it was the greatest mistake of Ukraine not to take that fucking peace talks [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=494.66s)]
*  And that they didn't do it because they were urged by Western leadership not to take that plan [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=499.54s)]
*  because the Western leadership told them that they would give funnel unlimited amounts of weapons and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=505.34s)]
*  Actually allow Ukraine to use those weapons in the targeting capabilities to be able to strike into Russian territory or something along those lines [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=510.18s)]
*  That instilled false confidence [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=517.46s)]
*  Because very clearly at the time they thought that they had an upper hand and they thought they thought that the Ukrainians were expendable and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=520.1800000000001s)]
*  Could be used to atrophy the or to diminish the the Russian forces [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=528.46s)]
*  Versions of this story have already been restated in the news time and time again, but people still say it's unconfirmed unsubstantiated [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=535.5400000000001s)]
*  It's it's bullshit [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=543.5400000000001s)]
*  Okay, that was my assessment and every single pro-ukrainian account and every single drama farmer [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=545.5799999999999s)]
*  yelled at me for saying that this was the best most advantageous moment for Ukraine where it had maximum leverage and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=552.2199999999999s)]
*  Everyone said no Ukraine can keep up the defense Ukraine can actually purge all the Russians from its forces. Oh [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=561.14s)]
*  Or shows no sign of ending Alex Rossi Sky News [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=567.38s)]
*  You [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpv81rsHyiA&t=575.54s)]
