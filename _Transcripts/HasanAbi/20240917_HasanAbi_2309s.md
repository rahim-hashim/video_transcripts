# Biden & Elon On Trump's Second Assassination Attempt | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw)
*  Elon Musk, a defense contractor, a multi-billionaire, literally said, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=0.0s)]
*  and no one is even trying to Biden slash Kamala. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  That's so insane that that's like the type of I would tweet, you know? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=9.44s)]
*  That's something I would tweet, dog. You can't tweet that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=13.52s)]
*  Like you're Elon Musk, dude. Are you insane? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=16.64s)]
*  What is this? You wanted me to watch this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  You're telling me Donald Trump got shot at again by another white guy? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  This white on white violence has to end. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=31.12s)]
*  Nah, I'm just around. I love white on white violence. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=34.16s)]
*  Or else would my girlfriend get all of her favorite true crime dramas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  For real though, isn't it kind of crazy how within like 30 minutes of the shooter's name [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=39.36s)]
*  getting revealed, Hassan Piker's entire community had every single ounce of social media posting [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  that man had ever done in his entire life. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=50.56s)]
*  And then he tunes into Fox News and CNN and they're like, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=54.64s)]
*  now what are the ties that Iran could have to this shooting? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  What are the causes that illegal immigration had on this particular shooting? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=61.6s)]
*  Like dog, none of them. This dude is the craziest NATO I've ever seen. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=66.72s)]
*  The guy who Trump literally went to Ukraine to fight and they were like, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=71.04s)]
*  you are over 50. We are not handing you a. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=76.96s)]
*  And then he came back to the United States and got a. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=79.36s)]
*  Seriously though, it is insane that Fox News just does not know what to do with this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=81.91999999999999s)]
*  shooting because it was a white guy. And even though it was a more left leaning [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=86.08s)]
*  white guy, he voted for Trump in 2016 and he's more of like a never Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Republican than anything else. The one thing this guy even ever has to stand on is Ukraine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  Oh, Fox News hosts are legitimately out here just being like, you know what? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  This is what happens when we don't have respect for the police. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  They did say that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=104.8s)]
*  It has nothing to do with that. You're so. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=105.6s)]
*  Yeah. They, they did say that that was awesome. Everybody on Fox News yesterday was just like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=107.92s)]
*  trying to hammer in whatever their own personal pet project is. Like they should have rolled out [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  like an old, like an old school, you know, George HW Bush style Republican to be like, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=119.36s)]
*  it's tort reform. The reason why, the reason why this shooter actually decided to take the action [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=124.56s)]
*  was because of tort reform. These, these liberals are in the pocket of big law. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=133.28s)]
*  These big lawyers, they're lobbying the democratic party. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=138.08s)]
*  So stupid. Do some journalism once. Could our journalists just do some damn journalism? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=142.16s)]
*  Damn video about Hassan. I've been mentioned with 52 K likes. God damn, dude. What is happening to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=147.84s)]
*  the world right now? Why can't I see the I'm scrolling? It won't let me scroll down. Now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=154.24s)]
*  My Tik Tok desktop is just fundamentally broken. You're telling me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=159.68s)]
*  I can't click on the comments or scroll down. What is this? Maya wanted to ask a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=163.44s)]
*  politic question during her IRL earlier. He's not live yet. Is he? Is she crying? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=167.76s)]
*  Damn it. I'm always scared to call us on when he's live. Cause he's always talking [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=172.88s)]
*  about something tragic and it looks like I'm out of touch. He just says the N word. Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=176.4s)]
*  I'm not calling us on. I'm not calling us on not now. I have to call him when he's offline, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=182.48s)]
*  bro. She, if she was a little bit faster on the trigger, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=188.24s)]
*  she would have just heard the N word by the way. Like that's perfect timing. Honestly, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=192.0s)]
*  that's perfect timing. But, but like she was so close. She was so close to hearing something [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  even more unhinged. Okay. Wait, my Tik Tok might be wonky because I'm not at a hundred percent. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=205.92s)]
*  No, it's not. Again, it's not letting me see the comments. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=214.24s)]
*  It might be a block. Yeah. She almost, she almost perfect framed it, dude. Obviously I don't condone [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=221.44s)]
*  his action. However, they don't seem to know his Ukrainian soldiers would follow him to their end. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=230.0s)]
*  His Afghan fighters are at his beck and call and his friends in Taiwan are awaiting his orders. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=234.8s)]
*  Wouldn't be shocked if he's just pretending to be detained right now as his squad could easily free [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=240.64s)]
*  him at any moment. They're playing with fire and CNN just lit the match. Stay strong. You are our [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=244.4s)]
*  hero. Ryan. I love Q and I'm larping for Ryan Ruth from reaction from Washington to senior white [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=250.32s)]
*  house correspondent, we just Jane Weijia. We just heard president Biden speak a few moments ago. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=257.36s)]
*  What did he say? Lindsay president? Biden said that he thanked God that the former president was [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=262.32s)]
*  okay. And he also said that it was clear that secret service needs more resources. And he thought [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=268.32s)]
*  that Congress should respond to the need in the coming weeks when asked specifically what it was, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=274.64s)]
*  whether it was personnel or more money for other things. He said personnel. And so the president [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=281.52s)]
*  speaking out for the first time after the second attempt on the former president as he was heading [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  to Philadelphia. Yeah, God forbid they ever feel scared of like, likely gun violence, even for a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=295.52s)]
*  brief moment. Holy imagine if they lowered themselves to the standard of like, a teacher [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=304.64s)]
*  at a public school, you know, or a child going to kindergarten. Imagine. Yeah, that feeling is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=314.4s)]
*  reserved for school kids in this country, not presidents or former presidents or current presidents [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=321.28s)]
*  or people running for president. Those are God's chosen people. If you're like an average American, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  though, yeah, sucks to suck gun violence is a reality for you. It's going to happen at certain [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=333.28s)]
*  point in your life. There's nothing you can do about it. Yeah. I'm wondering, I'm going to go [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  ahead and ask our control room if we have that sound now, can we go ahead and play that? I think [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  thank God the president's okay. I think we got a full report so far. We're down there tonight. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=346.32s)]
*  But one thing I want to make clear is service needs more help. And I think the Congress should [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=351.92s)]
*  respond to their needs if they back need more services. So that's what we're going to be talking [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=357.52s)]
*  about. Are you saying they need more money or if they need more personnel, they need more money, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=362.88s)]
*  what kind of help do you think? I think we need some more person. I think they may need, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=367.92s)]
*  they may be deciding whether they need more personnel or not. So we just, this is, we heard [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  from a statement from the White House. Now we're hearing from the president. Do you expect that we [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=377.76s)]
*  may hear from this, for example, when he is in Philadelphia today? Well, he could bring it up. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=382.32s)]
*  I mean, he just talked about it and he's going to Philadelphia for a totally separate event addressing [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=387.2s)]
*  the nationally historic black colleges meeting. I want to reiterate that I don't think that Trump [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=392.56s)]
*  needs more secret service clearance or I mean, a secret service security because he's not the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=398.72s)]
*  current president. He's the former president. I want to also state that if it were up to me, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=404.48s)]
*  I'd lower his current security. Okay, because it's far too costly. I'm a small government [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=409.04s)]
*  conservative. As you guys know, I don't believe in spending. Okay, I don't believe in all this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  extra spending. I think that it is abhorrent. We need to trim the fat. Okay. I don't believe [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=422.24s)]
*  that the taxpayer should fund Donald Trump's golfing golf outings just because he feels the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=429.6s)]
*  need that he's going to golf. Okay. I don't know. Call me controversial, but I think there's better [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=435.6s)]
*  uses for that money. Like giving it to Israel. That's what I think we should be doing. I'm a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=441.44s)]
*  small government conservative. I don't think Trump deserves the extra funding. I think Israel [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=447.12s)]
*  deserves it. They're the most moral nation on earth. Ukraine deserves it. No, no, no, no, no. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=452.24s)]
*  If we give that money to Ukraine, then you're teaching the shooter the worst lesson. You should [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=458.24s)]
*  instead give it to Israel. Whenever there's any sort of extra money in the couch, you know, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=463.76s)]
*  in between the couch cushions, I think about how I'll donate it to the state of Israel, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=469.2s)]
*  the beautiful state. Yeah. And so I guess there's a chance he could bring it up again, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=474.0s)]
*  but he tends to like to separate, you know, issues unless he hasn't spoken on it already. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=480.0s)]
*  And it's new. So because he made these remarks, it's hard to say, but probably not because he's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=487.04s)]
*  addressing, you know, college students and about historically black colleges around the country. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=492.56s)]
*  So I'm not. So this wasn't actually an attempt, right? Media just saying that as a clickbait. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=499.44s)]
*  No dog. What? Yeah, it was like he didn't get anywhere near it. But I mean, I think it definitely [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=504.24s)]
*  was. Now, if I was his lawyer, I wouldn't recognize that. If I was his lawyer, I'd say this is a law [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=511.2s)]
*  abiding citizen who was exercising his second amendment rights. Who the you to tell him he's [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=517.28s)]
*  not able to do that. But if we're being serious, like, yeah, no, I think he's an insane crank. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=522.48s)]
*  He's an insane crank who was like hyper focused on Ukraine, who probably wanted to attempt [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=528.88s)]
*  to shoot in him because in his mind, I think he was like, Trump is in the way of the thing that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=537.36s)]
*  I care about the most, which is defending Ukraine. So he was like, I'm going to go and do it, take [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  matters into my own hands. Not sure, but this is obviously going to be an ongoing issue with so [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  many mounting questions about how this could happen again. And the vice president also released [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=553.6s)]
*  a statement saying that she condemns any political violence and that she's just deeply disturbed by [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  what unfolded. It's awesome because Trump is such a book. The rhetoric lies as exemplified by the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=564.32s)]
*  false statements made by comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC debate [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=570.48s)]
*  and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe's then Kamala's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=576.88s)]
*  political opponent, me, has taken politics in our country to a whole new level of hatred, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  abuse and distrust because of this communist left rhetoric. The bullets are flying and it will only [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=591.84s)]
*  get worse, allowing millions of people from places unknown. I love that he couldn't even for the sake [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=598.88s)]
*  of this tweet dial back the unhinged rhetoric. Like he couldn't even to make a point to make a [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=606.32s)]
*  goddamn point, just not say the quiet part out loud again. And he just could not stop himself [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=615.2s)]

*  Second time. It's like barely a mention by the third time. We're not even going to cover it in [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  the news. I swear to God. They're like, ah, boring. It happened already. He survived. Who gives this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=682.24s)]

*  mean this from the bottom of our, those of you know, we, many of you do no place in political [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=729.44s)]
*  violence for political violence in America. None, zero, never. I've always condemned political [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=734.24s)]
*  violence. I always will in America. In America, we resolve our differences peacefully. The ballot [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=739.28s)]
*  box, not at the end of a gun. America suffered too many times the tragedy of a bullet. It solves [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  nothing and just tears the country apart. We must do everything we can to prevent it and never give [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=751.52s)]
*  it any oxygen. Folks, now today's event. And we have new details on the suspect in the second [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  attempt against former president Trump. The sheriff who pulled him over is speaking out describing him [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=764.4000000000001s)]
*  as oddly ambivalent. I was at the scene and he had a very, very kind of detached, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=769.6s)]
*  flat facial affect. Like it wasn't bothering him. And I, I was immediately suspicious. I thought, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=778.0s)]
*  yeah, this is probably the guy. How does this guy get to a fence with a tactical rifle and a sight, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=785.2s)]
*  on it and get a B on the former president of the United States? Guys, stop saying he's drunk. Okay. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=791.36s)]
*  He's a Florida sheriff. He has to be. It's up. It's his culture, sweetie. You guys are being annoying, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=797.68s)]
*  dude. He has to be drunk on the job. It's just the natural state of a Florida sheriff. What's next? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=804.64s)]
*  You're going to get mad at him for doing a hate crime. What has become of this country? We used [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=812.48s)]
*  to be a nation, a beautiful nation where Florida sheriffs could do hate crimes and drive drunk. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=817.28s)]
*  And now people get mad when you see a Florida sheriff slurring his speeches. It's like, I'm [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=822.64s)]
*  skipping this part. I don't even want to see it. They recovered a GoPro camera. They recovered [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=828.0s)]
*  bullet defecting plates and those plates were hanging on the fence. So we saw that in the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=832.72s)]
*  images that released last evening, new reaction, Wall Street journal editorial board. They say, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=838.8s)]
*  quote, the failure of another attempt against Donald Trump on Sunday, the second in two months [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=842.72s)]
*  is a great relief, but also another warning about our deranged politics. Kaylee McEnany with us now [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  for the commentary on what she's observing. Good morning to you on this Monday. When [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=853.6s)]
*  how do you piece this together? Kaylee? Yeah, look, you know, when I see that Wall Street [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=857.84s)]
*  Journal piece, I think people on both sides of the aisle need to stop back and reflect before [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=861.84s)]
*  they send out any sort of message on social media. Does this add to the politically caustic time [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=867.2s)]
*  or detract from it before sending out a message on either side? I only hold the shooter responsible [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=872.9599999999999s)]
*  for his actions. That being said, the two attempts have come against former President Trump, both of [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=878.2399999999999s)]
*  them really unprecedented to see this. And then the immediate aftermath, you have someone like [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=884.16s)]
*  Rachel Veneman, whose husband was the Trump impeachment witness for the first one. She comes [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=889.1199999999999s)]
*  out and says, no ears were harmed. Carry on with your Sunday afternoon. You've lost touch with [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=895.1199999999999s)]
*  humanity. And then when I think back more broadly, this isn't like, dude, we're not talking about like [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=900.08s)]
*  a black grandmother who works at a pole station, you know what I mean? Because Donald Trump has [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=906.48s)]
*  actually invited a ton of harm to those people and nobody gives a, but those are average people. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=912.24s)]
*  We're talking about Donald Trump, the president, okay, former president, like when people [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=917.84s)]
*  meet his standard and refuse to reckon with like how this kind of violence is happening to someone [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  like Donald Trump, when he has brought about this kind of violence for normal people on a regular [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=931.0400000000001s)]
*  fucking basis as the former president, like you can't turn around and be like, wow, we got to stop [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=936.32s)]
*  this rhetoric. Donald Trump hasn't stopped his rhetoric since he got, since the second attempt, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=941.44s)]
*  he's probably tweeted even more times with rhetoric than the last one. What are we talking [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=948.16s)]
*  about? The time Trump has advocated for violence from Axios, May 2nd, 2022. This is the direct [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=953.36s)]
*  cause for violence. Mind you, if you believe hook line and sinker things that have been said about [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=958.64s)]
*  president Trump, you believe that he wants a national abortion ban, that he is against IVF. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=963.36s)]
*  You believe that he's for project 2025, that he wants a blood bath, that he called neo-Nazis, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=968.88s)]
*  fine people, all of those facts checked as false. But then you see Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=973.36s)]
*  two hours after this incident, tweet out, extreme mega Republicans are the party of a national [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=977.36s)]
*  abortion ban and Trump's project 2025. He then puts out a statement condemning this. But then [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=982.0s)]
*  this morning is right back to project 2025 language. We all need to look at our rhetoric. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  Yo, this is not going to work. I mean, Democrats are cowards. They're cowards of the highest order, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=990.88s)]
*  but like to demand that they stop campaigning against Donald Trump is so insane. Like how [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=996.16s)]
*  comfortable are you? How entitled are you, dude? It's wild to me. Also speaking of rhetoric, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1002.0s)]
*  Elon Musk literally was like, why isn't anybody Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, which was awesome. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1009.36s)]
*  I mean, great job, sir. Keep posting. I obviously, he deleted the tweet. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1016.08s)]
*  I much like many other people, of course, called it out. I said, this man is a defense contract. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1022.64s)]
*  They're obviously every single person was like, what are you saying? Elon Musk, a defense contractor, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1028.72s)]
*  a multi billionaire literally said, are no one is even trying to Biden slash Kamala. That's so [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1035.52s)]
*  insane that that's like the type of I would tweet. You know, that's something I would tweet dog. You [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1042.8s)]
*  can't tweet that. But you're Elon Musk, dude. Are you insane? And for the record, like if I [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1048.24s)]
*  tweeted something like that, I would absolutely get a visit from the authorities. Okay. So he [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1053.44s)]
*  deleted the tweet. And then this was his excuse. Turns out that jokes are way less funny. If people [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  don't know the context and the delivery is playing tags. Yeah. And no one is even trying to Biden [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1064.88s)]
*  Kamala. I would even his writers were like, I would reconsider this poster getting out of hand. We [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1069.2s)]
*  need to unite. No one has even tried to do so is the point I'm making. And no one will. He doubled [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1073.28s)]
*  down on it. Like, what do you mean? It's not a joke. Yeah. He got a call from the, not the FBI [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  secret service, most likely, or maybe the FBI. No one has even tried to do so. Maybe delete the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1082.8s)]
*  post and reword. It seems that people like misinterpreting your obvious intent. Fair enough. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1087.84s)]
*  I don't want to do what they have done. Even in jest. Turns out my jokes are way less funny. If [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  people don't know the context of deliveries, plain tags. Well, one lesson I learned from this is just [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1097.44s)]
*  because I say something to a group and they laugh. Doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1102.0s)]
*  as a post on X. Yeah. Random guy says does he immediately get some door knock. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1106.48s)]
*  Okay. Elon Musk says this. I'm, they maybe gave him a phone call, but he probably did get a phone [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1111.76s)]
*  call to be like, are you serious right now? Megaphone X. This is not your opportunity to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1116.8s)]
*  send me all the previously deleted Elon Musk tweets. Okay. We're done with the Elon Musk portion [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1120.72s)]
*  of this conversation. Let's get back to Fox news. Not perpetuate mistruths because we are in a very [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  dangerous time. We are. Let's talk a little bit of politics then the ABC news poll that came out [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1131.52s)]
*  yesterday, uh, showed a little bit of an upswing for Harris at 5246 and then asking who won the [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1135.92s)]
*  debate. ABC news poll 58 36 as well on that front, but president Trump, uh, still up in the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1142.3200000000002s)]
*  swing States or at least within the margin of error. And in talking to undecided voters who [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1150.0s)]
*  will decide the election, they thought that Trump won or at least they did on the economy. And that's [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1155.52s)]
*  their most important issue. So what should we, that's crazy. Undecided voters also thought [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1160.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris won the debate. The only issue that people thought Trump won the debate on was the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1166.3200000000002s)]
*  economy. And even then, and even then it was by very slim margins. That's so funny. Make up all [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1172.96s)]
*  this. You know, I think back to these personal anecdotes that are outlined in the New York [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1179.44s)]
*  times of voters. And one such came from a woman named Judas. She was about a mile outside of the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1183.6000000000001s)]
*  Harris event in Pennsylvania on Friday. And she said, I thought Harris did a wonderful job in the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1188.56s)]
*  debate, but I need to know more about where she stands economically. This is a woman who works [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  for the school bus system, make 7 25 an hour. Her rent went from six 75 to a thousand dollars [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1197.68s)]
*  and she finds herself supporting president Trump because of the economy. When you have a universe [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1203.3600000000001s)]
*  in that ABC poll of 3% persuadable likely voters, only 3% on the margins, things matter. The economy [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1208.32s)]
*  is in Trump's column and you have to wonder when is the game changer moment for Kamala Harris [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1215.6s)]
*  coming? The polls are razor thin. She had her. The funniest part about this is like this represents [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1220.0s)]
*  a failure of Trump's like bare minimum campaign strategy on all fronts. The fact that the economy [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1225.76s)]
*  is supposed to be a winning issue for him and like he can't coherently put together a solid agenda [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  or even point to the failures of the Kamala Harris administration. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1241.8400000000001s)]
*  administration is a perfect demonstration of like how these guys have forgotten how to run [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1246.88s)]
*  because why? Because they're too busy yelling about like the most unhinged thing you've ever [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1254.56s)]
*  heard of in terms of immigrants. Okay. That's the problem. The problem is they are so invested in [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1260.32s)]
*  their little hug box on Twitter that they have diluted themselves into thinking that like saying [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1270.0s)]
*  sick, Hile and saying that like immigrants are vermin and parasitic is actually going to be great [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1277.36s)]
*  for the election. Like that's the only thing you need to harp on. It is completely ridiculous. Like [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1284.8s)]
*  bro, run a normal campaign, dude. Run a normal campaign. That's nutty. Biggest audience at the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1289.92s)]
*  DNC night for her biggest audience in the debate. 67 million people. When is she going to get another [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1296.96s)]
*  audience like that? Maybe never. That's a good question. We'll see whether or not they go back [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1302.16s)]
*  and forth in this debate. This is a Fox news update now on what we're hearing from the former [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1305.3600000000001s)]
*  president. He spoke with Fox. Yeah. The former president spoke. He said at the top of the hour, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1310.4s)]
*  there is a three minute ad break and Americans should no longer have to pay [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1315.5200000000002s)]
*  $6 to avoid the top of the hour ad break. It was $5 under my presidency. It's six [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1320.8000000000002s)]
*  under Brandon's you decide. Well, luckily for all of you, it's actually September. So it's 30% off. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1326.48s)]
*  You can also get gifted a sub if you are lucky years at three minute ad break now. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1333.28s)]
*  Fox digital a moment ago and he blames Biden and Harris's rhetoric Haley for causing him to be [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1336.96s)]
*  quote out. He went on to say, let me get the quote here guys. He Ralph believe the rhetoric of Biden [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1343.6s)]
*  Harris and he acted on it. Their rhetoric is causing me to be that one. I'm the one who is [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1351.76s)]
*  going to save the country. And they're the ones that are destroying the country, both from the [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1356.48s)]
*  East capitalistic socialist in 2024. What is capitalistic? Okay. I'm a capitalist. I love [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1359.84s)]
*  capitalism. Did anything change about my, the things that I'm saying for you? Yeah. I'm a [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1365.36s)]
*  capitalist. I love capitalism. I'm a capitalist. Well, there you go. Just like my goat, Charlie. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1371.28s)]
*  All right. Two based. Yeah, there you go. So now do you agree with the things that I'm saying? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1377.36s)]
*  Did anything change about what I was advocating for? No. Okay. Well, let's move inside and out. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1382.08s)]
*  They are the opposite. These are people that want to destroy our country, adding that it's called [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1388.8s)]
*  the enemy from within. They are the real threat and quote. So really his, you know, yesterday it [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1393.12s)]
*  was thanks to secret service. You guys did a great job. I'm okay. Thanks for your support. And today [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1398.0s)]
*  it is much different after meeting with the acting secret service director this past hour. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1404.48s)]
*  I think he should question their rhetoric. Again, I only hold the shooter responsible for their [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1409.28s)]
*  actions, but I do wonder why there has not been more of a forceful condemnation. Both of them put [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1413.1200000000001s)]
*  out statements condemning this. We heard that chopper talk from president Biden, but after the [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1417.84s)]
*  last attempt, he gave an oval office address 24 hours later. That met the moment. Why is he not [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1421.92s)]
*  doing that now? Kamala Harris did not mention this in the DNC, did not mention the attempt in the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1427.1200000000001s)]
*  debate. I would love to see her mention this on the campaign trail. Let's all lower the rhetoric. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1431.36s)]
*  I don't know that their response has really met the moment this time around, despite condemnations [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1436.24s)]
*  of paper statements, Twitter and chop. That would be a powerful moment if she were to go. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1440.56s)]
*  She said, let the chopper do the talking. That's right. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1444.6399999999999s)]
*  Put on a microphone today and say, yes, she may. She also has the power to convene. And [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1448.0s)]
*  I saw this the last time. It's pretty funny. It's like they have nothing, dude. They have nothing. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  They have nothing. They have literally nothing. They're like, oh, why didn't Kamala Harris talk [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1459.36s)]
*  about Donald Trump almost being at the DNC? Like, really? That's that's the best talking point you [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1464.6399999999999s)]
*  have. This is why I mean, like, if it was like a Haitian dude or something like, oh, my God, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1472.24s)]
*  they would be doing the media circus, right? If it's like a non white guy, God forbid, God forbid, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1476.9599999999998s)]
*  if it's like a non white man, OK, holy you'll see what the talking points actually are. You'll see [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1484.1599999999999s)]
*  what a successful media strategy to this attempt looks like then. But because it's a white guy, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1491.52s)]
*  they got nothing. OK, it's a white guy, former Trump Republican, now never Trumper. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1497.6799999999998s)]
*  Second time a lifelong Republican or a registered Republican voter has at or tried to shoot at [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1505.6s)]
*  the former Republican president. But ultimately, they can't do the tone down the narrative tone [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1512.72s)]
*  down the rhetoric because they're the rhetoric party. They also can't talk about gun control [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1519.44s)]
*  because they are the no gun control party. They are the gun violence party. So it's like a such [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1524.8s)]
*  an awful way for something that is otherwise supposed to be helpful for your electoral chances [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1531.44s)]
*  to happen at Donald Trump over and over again, where he just cannot use this in a tangible way [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1538.56s)]
*  to improve his his political outcome. The example that I used was like, I don't know if like [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1545.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris is if Kamala Harris was like attacked by a migrant or something, right? Not to say that [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1552.72s)]
*  like migrants are inherently right. Obviously, that's not the case. But they were. But in that [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1559.28s)]
*  situation, the Democratic Party would not be able to message around that people would be like, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1564.72s)]
*  you deserve it. You did this to yourself. Right. Even though technically, when you look at the [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  actual data, obviously, migrants are not responsible for more crimes than natural born US citizens are. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1576.56s)]
*  You know, you can ask for the Secret Service to come and give you a personal briefing. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1584.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, about what happened. I mean, Dr. Director row went directly to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1588.0800000000002s)]
*  She could ask for the same thing. I'm sure she's probably worried. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1592.16s)]
*  Per capita, they might be no, no, dude. No, per capita, they do not. No, I don't blame you [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1594.5600000000002s)]
*  for thinking that that might be the case, given how the media talks about this stuff. But you're [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1601.28s)]
*  wrong. They are nowhere near especially in totality, obviously, but also in per capita as well. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1606.4s)]
*  And about her own family as well. But Donald Trump making his point in that, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1614.64s)]
*  in that post today. So we'll keep an eye on it. And thanks for being here. Thank you. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1619.2800000000002s)]

*  And Clip. Fox News learned moments after the second attempt on his life yesterday afternoon, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1626.0800000000002s)]
*  former President Donald Trump sharing his main concerns with Sean Hannity of Fox News as he was [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1630.72s)]
*  rushed back to the clubhouse at his golf course. And Sean Hannity joins us now. Sean? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1636.32s)]
*  Why are you so charitable to think like this is idiotic. Because there are more people that [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1642.3999999999999s)]
*  think like that than think like you. And my job, my primary responsibility is to get guys that [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1647.6799999999998s)]
*  think like that to think like me. And yelling at them all the time, which I do when they when [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1654.56s)]
*  gets out of hand, right? When someone is like being an annoying little asshole, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1660.32s)]
*  then yeah, I'll match that energy back. But my job is to try and educate people. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1665.36s)]
*  It happened at 1 30 yesterday afternoon. And you got a call before it even broke before we all knew [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1670.88s)]
*  about it. Tell us that story. It wasn't really actually guys. It was not long right after the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1677.28s)]
*  incident happened. The president was playing with a dear friend of mine Steve Wood cough. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1684.16s)]
*  And I had gone to breakfast with Steve and another guy and other friend of ours and we had breakfast [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1689.6000000000001s)]
*  together. The whole breakfast Steve was giving me a hard time. Come play golf with us. Come play golf [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1695.8400000000001s)]
*  with us. And Steve is near a scratch. Bro, he's trying to Oh my god, he's trying to put himself [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1700.5600000000002s)]
*  in the story so bad, bro. Shut up, Sean. You were not invited. You were not invited, Sean. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1706.0s)]
*  Okay, I was almost there at the almost attempted attempt. It's like, wow, sick, man. Cool. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1712.8s)]
*  Like it's not like Trump almost died. He didn't even get that. What are you talking about? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1719.28s)]
*  Call for the president pretty much is a scratch. Call for it. I'm like, I don't have time to play. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1723.2s)]
*  So I'm not that good with you. Good at golf right now. But I hope I hope to get back to what I used [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1727.92s)]
*  to play. And so he goes off and plays my phone rings. Maybe before two right after the incident [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1734.0s)]
*  happened when he was immediately back in the clubhouse and he told me what had happened. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1741.84s)]
*  And he said that force a gun off. They heard it. It was pop, pop, pop, pop. That's how he described [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1747.04s)]
*  it. And he was absolutely positively blown away by how quickly the Secret Service got on the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1752.8799999999999s)]
*  president got him off the golf course, how quickly tripods were set up by by by sharpshooters within [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1764.24s)]
*  the Secret Service and how professional they were. He will tell his entire story tonight on [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1771.6s)]
*  Hannity. There are a couple of things I was listening to to Brian's interview with the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1778.7199999999998s)]
*  sheriff that law enforcement in Florida is so much better than it is in New York. They don't buy into [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1783.52s)]
*  this woke, defund, dismantled, no bail law, idiocy and insanity. They take law and order very seriously [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1790.32s)]
*  down here. And I praise the sheriff and I praise everybody in in the Secret Service. But there, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1797.84s)]
*  there is something we have to examine very close. Yeah, he was crying yesterday, but only crying [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1805.04s)]
*  because he wasn't there to dive in front of a potential bullet. That's it. Slee here. After [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1810.6399999999999s)]
*  conversation I had with Governor DeSantis last night, it really struck me. I said, Governor, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1816.6399999999999s)]
*  you've played that golf course. Tell me a little bit more about it. And he was describing how [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1821.9199999999998s)]
*  there are two holes, a par three and a par four. The par four is a dry. And I told him, Mr. President, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1827.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm nothing but a hole for you. I'm a par four. And what he described to me, it was the area closest [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1833.04s)]
*  to where this fence is that we keep hearing about that is surrounded in this treed area. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1840.6399999999999s)]
*  And what is really disconcerting to me, if you go back to Butler, remember, we were told by the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1848.24s)]
*  Secret Service, the people who are making the decisions what the perimeter around the president [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1853.92s)]
*  ought to be, not the guys that are willing to dive on the president, put their life in harm's way and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1860.4s)]
*  die to protect him. But the people that are are responsible for making sure that perimeter is [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1867.2s)]
*  closed. There are some real serious questions more than we had yesterday this morning, because they [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1875.28s)]
*  got within 130 yards in Butler and they claimed there was a slope roof that turned out not to be [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1881.44s)]
*  a slope roof at all. And that's very troublesome that we weren't told the truth then. And we still [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1887.44s)]
*  haven't gotten to the bottom of it. We know that Connecticut Senator Blumenthal said Americans will [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1892.4s)]
*  be shocked. They will be appalled when they learn about the failures in Butler. But now we have a [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1897.52s)]
*  situation where we have we have a street about 300 yards from where the president was. And what's [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1903.84s)]
*  very, very funny aspect of this is that he can't keep shitting on Secret Service because Trump keeps [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1914.32s)]
*  loving Secret Service. He's like, the Secret Service is the best. I love those guys. They save my life [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1919.04s)]
*  all the time. They're incredible. They just can't put a coherent, consistent narrative on this. They [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1924.1599999999999s)]
*  can't spin it because it's not like a migrant. That's it. They're so one note. What are they [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1931.92s)]
*  going to do complain about Democrats and their rhetoric? You can't do that. Zero people believe you. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1937.92s)]
*  You can't. You are the party of rhetoric. You do it all the time. Trump is complaining about rhetoric [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1943.92s)]
*  while also immediately packaging that complaint with more rhetoric. So it doesn't work. You know, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1949.52s)]
*  it rings hollow. He almost one framed it. Concerning to me is how is it possible that nobody was [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1955.04s)]
*  watching that street? And the way Governor DeSantis described this to me was if you ever see a picture [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1963.3600000000001s)]
*  of Donald Trump playing golf, it's it's a photographer in that treat area by the fence that we keep hearing [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1969.8400000000001s)]
*  about that there that's the area where they're going to get the picture, right? They're not going [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1977.76s)]
*  to get it anywhere else on the golf course. Well, that would also be the area that if you are a [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1982.08s)]
*  shooter, that you have the closest proximity to now a top presidential candidate, former president. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1987.36s)]
*  And that kind of bothered me during the press conference yesterday when they said, well, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1996.08s)]
*  there would have been more protection if he was the president. There was a recent attempt just [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=1999.76s)]
*  60 some odd days ago. He's a top presidential contender. We're 51 days away from a from a [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2003.9199999999998s)]
*  presidential election. And you're allowing somebody with an as a scope on it to be literally within [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2010.56s)]
*  300. I don't get like, I don't get what their solution to this is. Like I get the Butler [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2018.08s)]
*  Pennsylvania Cup. But like in this one, he's doing a secret event that is obviously not so secret [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2025.76s)]
*  because he probably plays golf there all the time. But like, like it's it's a [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2033.04s)]
*  go back to tick tock boomer next to related videos on top click comments. No, I did that already. It [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2041.36s)]
*  didn't work. Stop. Like, are they taking I like that they are basically saying what every American [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2046.08s)]
*  is aware of in their hearts, which is like there should be a gun free zone only around Donald Trump. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2053.92s)]
*  Like no one should be allowed to have a gun just around Donald Trump though. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2061.04s)]
*  Everywhere else you can be gunned up. Okay. But if Donald Trump wants to go somewhere, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2065.44s)]
*  then gun control, please. For a one mile radius, we must have gun control for a one mile radius. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2070.64s)]
*  Actually, we also need to do people control. We need to do gun control. And on top of that, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2077.7599999999998s)]
*  we need to make sure like, if you are, I don't know, on your way to work, we're going to stop [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2082.64s)]
*  you and we're gonna be like, how do you feel about the former president? If you say, I don't [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2086.64s)]
*  know, then sorry, you are not allowed to go to work today. You have to redirect. Okay. You have [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2090.8799999999997s)]
*  to redirect your trip away from here because you are not super pro Trump yards, which would be the [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2097.7599999999998s)]
*  equivalent if you want a golf analogy of a one foot putter or a tap in pot. So there is a major [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2106.3199999999997s)]
*  failure here. If they're not covering that street and making sure there isn't as Trump, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2113.36s)]
*  he doesn't think there's a major failure. You try to, you tried to do this narrative last time. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2117.92s)]
*  And he was like, nah, dude, they saved my ass. It was sick. I loved it. Like that's it. Sure. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2122.08s)]
*  Nobody gets in the bushes, let alone with it in two backpacks and a GoPro and, and everything [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2127.84s)]
*  else we know that this guy had a scary, I will tell you this. I think as close as Butler was, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2134.4s)]
*  we were, this is, this is so eerie. They got, this guy got very close to the president. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2142.56s)]
*  If it weren't for one secret service agent, you know, spotting the, the, the rifle and taking the [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2150.48s)]
*  this guy gets off. This is a very different story. Tell us the story. I heard you share it on radio [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2158.48s)]
*  about the town hall, how your last town hall with Donald Trump was different. Well, you know, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2163.6s)]
*  I thought at some point somebody might remember I said that story. I was probably not going to [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2168.0s)]
*  talk about it again. I, if LJ was here today, I was going to say to LJ, LJ, I've been doing [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2172.08s)]
*  town halls since before you were born. We all love LJ. And I've done all these town halls all around [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2178.32s)]
*  the country. I've done many with president Trump in particular. I've had events with George W. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2185.36s)]
*  Bush, other, other presidents and other presidential candidates. I think I interviewed all 17 [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2189.6s)]
*  Republican candidates back when they were running in 2015 and 16. And so I've had all these town [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2196.16s)]
*  halls. When I did the recent one in Harrisburg, I'd never faced a situation like I did here [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2203.6s)]
*  where the secret service was adamant. Nobody in the audience could be on the floor surrounding [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2210.24s)]
*  the stage. That had never been the case in any previous town hall. Then we were told, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2216.16s)]
*  we're not going to allow you to fill in, fill up the entire building. And there was a little back [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2221.04s)]
*  and forth with, with the campaign and we were asking why, because that had never happened before. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2227.44s)]
*  And then one other very strange thing happened that I had never experienced, which was [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2234.88s)]
*  the secret service, whoever was in charge of the detail that day, very nicely, great guy. I love [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2239.6000000000004s)]
*  these guys. I admire these guys. They're, they're willing to risk their lives for people. He asked [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2244.32s)]
*  for a few minutes of my time to pull me aside, pull me to an area where we were both looking at [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2249.44s)]
*  the stage that I was going to be on doing the town hall, where I would be sitting, where president [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2255.12s)]
*  Trump would be sitting. And then pointed out on the stage, I don't want to go into too many details, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2260.32s)]
*  pointed out in the area, two separate locations I could go if we're fired at that event. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2267.28s)]
*  Oh boy. Yeah. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2273.28s)]
*  In all the town halls I had done over all these many years, that had never happened before, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2274.0s)]
*  nor had we had audience limitations like we had there. So that was, that was pretty odd, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2278.56s)]
*  which tells me if I was going to make a conclusion, there are actionable threats that, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2284.72s)]
*  that probably this is what director Ray is talking about every time he goes before Congress. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2289.52s)]
*  Indeed. Does this guy know what kids go through every day of school? Not his kids. These kids [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2294.4s)]
*  are going to private school. Shouts out to the one chatter. He doesn't have to worry about that. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2298.4s)]
*  What is this? Pakistani man charged an alleged plot to Trump and other politicians. Oh, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2303.12s)]
*  that's awesome. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9sQPqAw4Lw&t=2308.16s)]
