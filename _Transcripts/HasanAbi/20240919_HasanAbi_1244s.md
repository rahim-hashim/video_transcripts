# Where Do You Fit In The Political Typology | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs)
*  would be acceptable if any other country became as militarily [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=0.0s)]
*  powerful as the United States. How about no militarily power? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=2.24s)]
*  I mean, yeah, fine. And whatever. Wait, what? quiz [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=5.0s)]
*  submissions? Oh, you bricked it chat. Did you break it? So [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=8.16s)]
*  annoying. Annoying. An exercise in futility. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=11.96s)]
*  Oh, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=17.4s)]
*  political topology quiz. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=27.96s)]
*  said I was gonna do this. And it's time to do it. I am going [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  to do the political topology quiz. Earlier today, we looked [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=34.04s)]
*  at a earlier today, we looked at a Kamala Harris supporter being [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=37.08s)]
*  shocked that they were right wing on this topology quiz. Now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=41.92s)]
*  we dive in to find out which one of our nine political topology [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=46.24s)]
*  groups is best your match compared to the nationally [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=49.88s)]
*  representative survey of more than 10,000 us adults by pure [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=51.96s)]
*  research center. You may find some of these questions difficult [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  to answer. That's okay. In those case, pick the answer that comes [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=58.6s)]
*  close to your view, even if it's an even if it isn't exactly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=61.28s)]
*  right. If you had to choose, would you rather have a smaller [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=63.96s)]
*  government providing fewer services a bigger government [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=66.48s)]
*  providing more services? When you say you favor a bigger [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=68.88s)]
*  government providing more services? Do you think it'd be [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=71.56s)]
*  better to modestly expand on current government services, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=73.52s)]
*  greatly expand on current government services, which are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  the following statements come close to your closest to your [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=79.6s)]
*  view. America's openness to people from all over the world [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  is essential to who we are as a nation. If America is too open [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  to people from all over the world, we risk losing our [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=89.36s)]
*  identity as a nation. In general, would you say experts [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  who study a subject for many years are usually better at [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=94.08s)]
*  making good policy decisions about that subject than other [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=96.56s)]
*  people? Usually better, usually worse at making good policy [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=98.8s)]
*  decisions about that subject than other people. Neither better [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=102.92s)]
*  nor worse at making good policy decisions about that subject. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=104.88s)]
*  Okay, this is the first time where it's like, it's not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=107.6s)]
*  usually better. But I mean, it's probably the closest. Experts [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=110.2s)]
*  are oftentimes very dumb. But, you know, it depends. Thinking [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=114.92s)]
*  about the increased trade of goods and services between the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=119.52s)]
*  US and other nations in recent decades, would you say that the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=121.52s)]
*  US has gained more than it has lost? Because increased trade has [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=124.08s)]
*  helped lower prices and increased competitiveness of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=127.68s)]
*  some US businesses lost more than it has gained because it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=130.23999999999998s)]
*  increased trade has cost jobs in manufacturing and other [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=133.11999999999998s)]
*  industries have lowered wages for some US workers lost more [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=135.32s)]
*  than it has gained. How much more of anything needs to be [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=138.28s)]
*  done to ensure equal rights for all Americans, regardless of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=141.04s)]
*  their racial or ethnic backgrounds a lot, duh, which [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  comes closer to your view about what needs to be done to ensure [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=148.88s)]
*  equal rights for all Americans, regardless of the racial or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=151.28s)]
*  ethnic backgrounds, even if neither is exactly right. Most [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=155.28s)]
*  laws and major institutions need to be completely rebuilt [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=158.24s)]
*  because they're fundamentally biased against some racial [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=160.44s)]
*  ethnic groups. While there are many inequities in the US and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=162.2s)]
*  laws and institutions, necessary changes can be made by working [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=165.52s)]
*  with them. Okay, question number six, which of the following [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=167.72s)]
*  statements comes closest to your worldview business corporations [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=170.72s)]
*  make too much profit. Most corporations make a fair and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=173.32s)]
*  reasonable. No business corporations should make no [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  profit. That's the closest to my worldview. How much if at all [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=178.76s)]
*  would it bother you to regularly hear people speak a language [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=182.72s)]
*  other than English in public spaces? That's insane. On a scale [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=185.6s)]
*  of zero to 100, where zero means you feel cold and negative as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=189.4s)]
*  possible 100 means you feel as warm and positive as possible. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=193.04s)]
*  How do you feel towards Democrats? I'm going to go with [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  10. How do you feel towards Republicans zero? Which of these [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  statements best describes your opinion about the United States? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=203.24s)]
*  The US stands above all other countries in the world. The US [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=206.12s)]
*  is one of the greatest countries in the world along with some [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=208.64s)]
*  others. There are other countries that are better than [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=210.24s)]
*  the US. Where is my option, which is the United States is a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=212.28s)]
*  blight on progress for the working class all around the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=217.44s)]
*  world, both historically and still currently. It is so bad [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=221.16s)]
*  that it's actually a blight on the domestic working class as [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=224.8s)]
*  well. The United States consistently works against the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=227.68s)]
*  interests of bettering society, both here and also overseas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=230.84s)]
*  Okay, a continuation of the other stain on global history, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=235.52s)]
*  which would be the English the British Empire. Okay, we are [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=240.48s)]
*  literally the number one at everything bad. Okay. We are not [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  the number one in anything good with like maybe some cherry [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=248.6s)]
*  pick data like I don't know brain cancer research or some [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=251.04s)]
*  but like beyond that, we are literally evil. Okay, we're [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=253.44s)]
*  evil. I like that that's not an option though we have there are [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=256.68s)]
*  other countries that are better than the US. How much of a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=264.0s)]
*  problem if any would you say each of the following are in the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=266.32s)]
*  country today people being too easily offended by others say [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=268.28s)]
*  people being too easily offended minor problem. People saying [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=272.88s)]
*  things that are offensive to others major problem for sure. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=276.28s)]
*  That is a that is a big problem in my opinion, because I assume [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  they're talking about hate speech, which comes closer to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=283.28s)]
*  review the candidates for political office even if neither [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  is exactly right. I usually feel like there's at least one [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=287.84s)]
*  candidate who shares most of my views. None of the candidates [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=289.96s)]
*  represent my views well. In general, how much do white people [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=292.52s)]
*  benefit from the advantage in society that black people do not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=295.2s)]
*  have a great deal? Do you think greater social acceptance of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  people who are transgender people who identify as gender as [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  different from the sex they were assigned at birth is very good [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=302.84s)]
*  for society. Overall, would you say people who are convicted of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  in this country serve too much time in prison too little time [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=309.4s)]
*  is prison about the right time? No, what the who that would say [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=311.84s)]
*  anything but too much time in prison? Which of the following [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=315.52s)]
*  statements comes closest to your view religion should be kept [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=318.12s)]
*  separate from the government policies government policies [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=320.28s)]
*  should support religious values and beliefs. In the future. Do [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  you think us policy should try to keep America keep it so that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  America is the only military superpower? Ew, it would be [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=327.32s)]
*  acceptable if any other country became as militarily powerful as [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=330.48s)]
*  the United States. How about no militarily power? I mean, yeah, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=332.84s)]
*  fine. And whatever. Wait, what? quiz submissions? Oh, you bricked [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=335.84s)]
*  it chat. Did you break it? So annoying. Annoying. An exercise [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=339.8s)]
*  in futility. Not even necessarily your fault. It's all [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=346.4s)]
*  it's probably the fault of the website for not assuming that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=357.56s)]
*  they're going to get this much traffic. So what do I do? Do I [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=361.4s)]
*  just sit here and wait? Do I just refresh it? Or also, it's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=364.76s)]
*  about the political topology quiz. All right, before we get [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  to the news, let's get started. Okay, let's get started with the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=372.28s)]
*  serious portion of the broadcast now that we've been around for [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=375.44s)]
*  like an hour. Yeah, I'll do the Neom influencer stuff, which is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=377.32s)]
*  going to be great. But I got the progressive left your best fit [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=380.54s)]
*  is progressive left with along with 6% of the public progressive [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=384.8s)]

*  political topology group have very liberal views on virtually [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=391.78s)]
*  every issue and support far reaching changes to address [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=394.1s)]
*  racial injustice and expand the social safety net. They're among [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=396.38s)]
*  the smallest apology groups, but also one of the most politically [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=399.7s)]
*  engaged they feel less warmly towards the Democratic Party [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=402.8s)]
*  than establishment liberals or Democratic mainstays. But those [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=405.14s)]
*  who voted in 2020 general election were nearly unanimous [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=407.94s)]
*  in their support for Joe Biden. They are the only group in which [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=410.26s)]
*  a majority say they like political leaders who identify [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=413.06s)]
*  as democratic socialists. progressive left are six percent [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=415.46s)]

*  assessment on the daily, the way he presented the story on the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1029.6200000000001s)]
*  daily in terms of the ultra nationalist radicalization. Can [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1034.1000000000001s)]
*  you admit when you're wrong asking generally Lamont? Of [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1038.74s)]
*  course I do. I always do. There's a difference. However, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1040.74s)]
*  when I'm not wrong, and Chad is just waiting for me to be wrong [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1044.26s)]
*  so they can just like pounce and bait me because they're being [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1048.06s)]
*  annoying. It's on they're baiting you about being wrong. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1052.46s)]
*  It's a hater identified by now. Nevermind it. I know. Anyway, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1054.66s)]
*  man, so you're saying all this is look alike. L take. Okay, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1057.6200000000001s)]
*  we're done. So anyway, as I was saying, isn't argument that you [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1060.66s)]
*  called him a Zionist yesterday. Apparently, yeah, I'm still [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1063.9s)]
*  calling him a Zionist. I said he is a liberal Zionist. I think the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1066.02s)]
*  issue here is that people don't understand the words that are [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1070.18s)]
*  coming out of my mouth. I'm saying I'm saying that the daily [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1073.14s)]
*  in terms of like the New York Times coverage on Israel, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1078.98s)]
*  actually did a pretty solid job. I'm not expecting them to do [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1083.5800000000002s)]
*  like plus 972 magazine style coverage. Okay, I'm not [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1088.42s)]
*  expecting them to even do higher style coverage. I'm simply [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1092.38s)]
*  shocked because they often the New York Times oftentimes out [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1096.3400000000001s)]
*  flanks even Israeli publications that are not only [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1100.66s)]
*  not but sometimes they outflank Israeli publications that are [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1105.26s)]
*  themselves Zionist publications. So judging by that metric, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1109.4199999999998s)]
*  judging by that metric, it is actually shocking how how this [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1113.74s)]
*  journalist was placing the blame on all things Israel, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1119.78s)]
*  Palestine, specifically on the settlers, and the rise of the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1126.34s)]
*  ultra nationalist right. Some of the notes that I had on it, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1132.34s)]
*  however, in terms of criticism was when he called the the [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1135.7s)]
*  Baruch Goldstein an activist. He said he was a far right [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1143.46s)]
*  activist instead of calling him a terrorist. Okay, by outflank [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1147.94s)]
*  you mean like analyst analysis that's correct. No outflank is [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1151.62s)]
*  in like even more hardline right wing in their commentary. Yes. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1154.34s)]
*  But who called scene he doesn't even like the guy I'm just [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1159.7s)]
*  simply saying like I'm I think you choose those words very [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1162.26s)]
*  carefully. When you talk about a guy like Baruch Goldstein, and [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1165.9s)]
*  you call him a far right activist after openly admitting [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1169.82s)]
*  like what he did, he called him a master. He said all of it. But [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1172.94s)]
*  like, there was a couple instances where I was like, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1175.38s)]
*  okay, like he's, you know, you should just call him a [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1177.54s)]
*  terrorist, the Israeli government did, or eat him our [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1179.78s)]
*  bang, give air or bezel a small fridge. He openly talked about [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1182.46s)]
*  alleged attempted assassination attack, assassination [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1186.4599999999998s)]
*  involvement. He talked about it to my bank beers, alleged, not [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1191.6599999999999s)]
*  alleged open calls for assassinating it's like a [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1195.7399999999998s)]
*  ravine. So like, he did a lot of that. And I think it's good for [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1198.5s)]
*  people who watch the New York Times and listen to the New York [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1202.3s)]
*  Times daily who read the New York Times to hear that side [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1204.82s)]
*  because they never get that. Okay, that's it. The New York [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1207.26s)]
*  Times consistently washes the Israeli local Israeli liberal [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1209.7399999999998s)]
*  leftist newspapers are far more closely accurately use the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1212.6999999999998s)]
*  language Yes, or even even J post, which is not liberal nor [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1215.26s)]
*  leftist at all, like even J post or Y net will sometimes cover [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1219.98s)]
*  what is going on truthfully, in a way that the New York Times [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1224.74s)]
*  never does. Times of Israel, another newspaper that is not [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1228.1s)]
*  exactly a leftist or liberal newspaper, but they will openly [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1231.02s)]
*  talk about what's happening. Because that's their job, their [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1234.14s)]
*  job is to cover the news, right? The New York Times. That's what [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1236.98s)]
*  I mean, when I say the New York Times will sometimes outflank [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo_RfeYFYs&t=1239.98s)]
