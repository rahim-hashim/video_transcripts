# Israel Is About To Do Something Horrifying | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY)
*  What will it take? I wonder for a coalition of the willing to form. Cause like, like what's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=0.0s)]
*  going to happen is they, do they have to like, like a high profile leader in a Western state [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=6.08s)]
*  or something like in broad daylight, like the IDF just like a beloved European politician [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=10.94s)]
*  or something. Would that work [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=19.94s)]
*  to the fray into this conflict in a more meaningful fashion. That's it. It's that simple. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=27.24s)]
*  And clearly the reason why they leaked this to CNN is because I'll let back brother, like [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=35.76s)]
*  calm down. I feel like there's still, I feel like there's still a, a, a little bit of restraint [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=40.44s)]
*  here from America as opposed to how aggressive Dylan's office says airstrikes to television [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  is a liberal position at this point in the hour. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=55.32s)]
*  Since I tweeted this, Israel has fired on 30 diplomats in the West bank and made sufficient [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=56.88s)]
*  military movements. I don't, I disavow this position for the record. I don't agree with [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=60.24s)]
*  this. Okay. I'm not saying this, but you know, he says in the hours I made this week, Israel's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=64.24s)]
*  fired on 30 diplomats in the West bank, made sufficient military movements towards a unilateral [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in the U S had to leak it to the press. People seem [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=75.6s)]
*  content to just ignore Israel or lament how sad it is as long as it's only Palestinians [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=80.12s)]
*  in the extermination camp. But this state is on a collective death drive that knows no [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=84.28s)]
*  borders and will drag the world into war if not stopped by force. As my friends are, won't [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=87.6s)]
*  to say we have a Hitler problem. We do. We do. The other side of this is that Israel, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=93.56s)]
*  obviously the other side of this is that like, isn't the entire point or at least the ancillary [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=100.36s)]
*  point of Israel to maintain instability in the region? Yes and no. It is in the interim, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=106.24s)]
*  but like the grand design for the region is that Israel dominates and Israel has even [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=112.28s)]
*  more control than it did before with no enemies whatsoever that can cause destabilization [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  down the line. But the other side of the story is why Israel is unable to stop this. And [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=122.72s)]
*  I've explained this before, but it bears repeating if Israel stops this, okay, and let's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=128.88s)]
*  say they get to occupy northern Gaza. This is a terrifying prospect, right? But it's, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=133.52s)]
*  it's somehow not the worst possible outcome of this scenario. So let's say that happens, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=139.44s)]
*  okay? Then what? You let Western journalists into southern Gaza. What do you think happens [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=146.24s)]
*  if you think people have already radicalized against Israel because they've seen brown [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=153.76s)]
*  children speak on their own demise in real time as they're being lasered out of the sky? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=159.84s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen when white people are there showing the atrocities, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=165.84s)]
*  white people that, you know, other white people here in the Western world like and enjoy and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=170.72s)]
*  listen to? I feel like Israel did not let in Western reporters into the strip in the, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=175.44s)]
*  in the short ceasefire that took place that they violated instantly for this reason, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  because if there was any Western reporters that were allowed into the strip, it would have been, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=189.44s)]
*  it would have been over. Even when people get a peep of, even when Rachel Curry, Thomas Herndahl, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=194.72s)]
*  great question, or rather great point that you're making here. The dynamic is entirely different [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=201.84s)]
*  than the Rachel Corey situation now. That's it. That's all this is. Because when Rachel Corey was [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=208.4s)]
*  was killed by an idea of bulldozer, most people were still very much locked into mainstream news. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=216.32s)]
*  There was so much more trust for mainstream institutions and mainstream institutions were [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=223.2s)]
*  of one mind. Okay, the level of resentment that people feel right now, the level of resentment [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  that people feel right now against Israel is far worse than it was even when Shereen Abu Akhlek was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=235.28s)]
*  assassinated. It's a totally different set of circumstances. This isn't to say like Israel [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=241.28s)]
*  doesn't get to kill white Americans without incurring any punishments. I'm saying the flow [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=247.84s)]
*  of information coming out of the Gaza Strip right now and the mainstream coverage of over it would [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=254.88s)]
*  literally change the tide permanently. Today Netanyahu said these are the conditions that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=260.48s)]
*  and among them the Trump plan for Gaza. Yes. What is being set up by the West is an equation that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=265.12s)]
*  Iran cannot escape from either it reaches an agreement to somehow stop enriching uranium, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=271.12s)]
*  or it reaches a deal where it can enrich uranium, then Israel bombs its nuclear facilities anyway. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=275.36s)]
*  Netanyahu says amid another schedule around the US Iran talks, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=281.12s)]
*  says if they can reach an agreement that will prevent Iran from the capability to enrich uranium, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=285.76s)]
*  we will welcome it. However, the state of Israel keeps the right to itself to protect itself. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=289.76s)]
*  Here Netanyahu also some of the other things that he said. Jeremy Scahill also has a thread on it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=295.12s)]
*  By the way, this is an interesting person. Shael Ben Ebrahim was literally [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=301.04s)]
*  he was initially Shael Ben Ebrahim if I if I remember correctly is one of those dudes [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=307.12s)]
*  that a couple months ago was like I'm done. I was one of the loudest voices defending Israel. I can't [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  any longer. It is literally a it is literally a I am an anti-Zionist now. I'm so I was so wrong and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=319.12s)]
*  I apologize profusely and he's one of those guys that just like flipped entirely. Now, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=326.88s)]
*  that doesn't mean that he's like all the way there for the record, but I'll take it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=333.04s)]
*  Netanyahu's new conditions for ending the war were include complete occupation of Gaza and the Trump [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=337.68s)]
*  plan. The pretense is gone. This isn't about October 7 or the hostage is about complete [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=342.08s)]
*  destruction of the Palestinian people. All hostages returned Hamas laid down his weapons, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=345.84s)]
*  leadership of Hamas exiled Gaza is completely demilitarized implementation of the Trump plan, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=349.2s)]
*  which is a final solution says the end of Gideon's chariot. All areas of Gaza strip [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=353.52s)]
*  will be under Israeli control. He says that the US and other allies are giving full support and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  weapons for what Netanyahu described as killing these monsters. Netanyahu calls Trump's plan for [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=363.76s)]
*  depopulating Gaza of Palestinians revolutionary Netanyahu repeats his stance that Israel will [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=367.52s)]
*  not engage in a permanent ceasefire only temporary agreements that will release Israeli that will [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  release Israeli captives and will continue with the ultimate aim of implementing what he keeps [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  calling Trump's plan. I think him saying this is Trump's plan is bad for Trump. I don't think [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=383.12s)]
*  Trump will like it because he doesn't like losers and Israel is not exactly a winner right now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=390.32s)]
*  And although it is quite literally Trump's plan and he is not wrong to call it that Trump might [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=396.64s)]
*  not necessarily like this association. Netanyahu said he has changed the Middle East with his [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=403.04s)]
*  wars. He says the war in Gaza has taken so long because no army has encountered such an urban [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=407.76s)]
*  setting. There has not been anything like that in Fallujah or anywhere else. Netanyahu says it is [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=411.36s)]
*  taking this long to defeat Hamas because we want to achieve our goals with minimum loss of IDF [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=416.0s)]
*  soldiers. He adds it won't take another 18 months. Netanyahu says that Israel will only allow aid for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=420.8s)]
*  Gaza distributed in individual meal boxes not trucks with aid for local distribution. Eventually [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  he says Israel creates sterile zones to distribute some food. Meanwhile this was happening in Israel [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=429.92s)]
*  for those of you who are confused Israeli citizens not military not the police trying to block aid [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=434.8s)]
*  trucks from entering Gaza. Hard to imagine how people end up this twisted. It's not that hard [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=440.48s)]
*  to imagine. Here's channel four's reporting on this obviously. Israeli protesters have gathered [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=444.48s)]
*  near the border to block. Look I'm not going to say nothing but the uniform has changed quite a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  bit since World War II you know what I mean? Like like mentally ill they used to wear Hugo Boss [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=458.8s)]
*  you know? I don't know what's going on here. Trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=465.92s)]
*  Israel recently launched a new offensive. It's just like it's just like what the what that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=472.0s)]
*  Haaretz writer was saying it's like the yoga yogi nazis. But it also partially lifted its 11 week [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=477.92s)]
*  blockade on food supplies. Some trucks have been allowed into Gaza this week but the UN says the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=485.12s)]
*  military still hasn't given them permission to distribute the aid. Without it international [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=490.96s)]
*  experts have warned of a potential famine. Anti-aid protesters were eventually removed by police from [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  the roads to let the trucks through. Ethan would call these people benign dudes that are just [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  holding on the aid. Wow I can't believe the Israeli military is stopping these people from [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=508.56s)]
*  rendering aid to the Palestinians you know? It's really dumb. Anyway in in uh in other news [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=513.6s)]
*  in other news here is uh more Israeli depravity more Israeli insanity the Israeli occupying [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=521.12s)]
*  fire uh force is really occupying farts fired near diplomatic delegation in Jenin citing route [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=529.36s)]
*  breach no injuries reported let's take a look. Open fire towards a diplomatic delegation in [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=537.12s)]
*  in the occupied west bank. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=544.24s)]
*  The group included diplomats from the European Union who were visiting to observe conditions [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=549.28s)]
*  in the city's refugee camp. A WAFA news agency says at least five bullets were fired towards [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=553.92s)]
*  the delegation. Italy's foreign minister has summoned Israel's an ambassador to the country [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=559.6s)]
*  in response. We're going to go to Handa Sahoot she's joining us from the Jordanian capital [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=564.72s)]
*  Amman she's there because the Israeli government has. What will it take I wonder for a coalition [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=568.72s)]
*  of the willing to form because like like what's going to happen is they do they have to like [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=574.24s)]
*  assassinate like a high profile leader in a western state or something like in broad daylight [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=578.72s)]
*  like the IDF just like kills a beloved European politician or something would that work would that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=585.76s)]
*  actually would that actually cause what needs to be done to be done like because I don't I mean [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=593.36s)]
*  it's not unlikely who's going to help China USA Russia love trading with Israel. I think that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=600.0s)]
*  even look even if European leaders were to be like we're done with this we're cutting it [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=608.4s)]
*  completely. Shell was on breaking points at your go saying how he doubted the rapes since today [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=614.08s)]
*  Taman happened then he became radicalized when the footage came out and he got pro he got the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=618.24s)]
*  pro-rape riots. He calls it a genocide but he posted your interview with Simone negatively [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=621.6s)]
*  Simone Zimmerman might he posted negatively about my interview with Simone Zimmerman about [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=626.72s)]
*  Israelism the documentary that she made about the the the efforts it takes to unbrainwash [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=632.16s)]
*  American Jews away from Zionism. That's crazy. It's banned Al Jazeera from reporting inside Israel [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=642.0s)]
*  and the occupied West Bank. Just give us a little idea of what has been happening in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=649.04s)]
*  Jenin what the EU delegation was tasked with when they were over there. Well it was dozens of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=654.7199999999999s)]
*  representatives from many different countries including EU countries the UK Sri Lanka many [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=660.4s)]
*  Arab countries including Jordan and essentially what they were there to do was kind of get a [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=666.48s)]
*  scope of the scale of destruction that's been caused by the Israeli military since their siege [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=671.5999999999999s)]

*  uh massive crowds forming uh in the pro-palestinian movement on european capitals [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1687.52s)]

*  what israel the israeli army is describing as a large-scale offensive in gaza so what are we [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1771.28s)]
*  expecting [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1776.72s)]
*  so what we've continued to see is israel bombing parts of the gaza strip overnight [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1780.16s)]
*  with more people killed across the strip at least 20 of them according to the hamas run civil defense [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1787.3600000000001s)]

*  due to the external pressure that there's been and also some domestic criticism too he said that the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1833.2s)]
*  plan was to expand the maneuver in gaza to destroy the terrorist infrastructure until hamas is [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1839.44s)]
*  defeated and just when it comes to the movement of these people where are they being moved to what [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1846.8s)]
*  kind of facilities are there is there even a humanitarian area now in gaza given the destruction [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1853.28s)]
*  of the whole strip [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1859.68s)]
*  i mean what we've seen in both the south of gaza yesterday is israel's plan to literally just [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1863.28s)]
*  continue the genocide regardless of outside pressure yes until america fucking reigns israel [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1869.68s)]
*  in enough pressure coming from european parties that causes america to also come across like a [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1875.44s)]
*  pariah because this isn't just about like israel being a so a pariah state israel already is a [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4spvLTqnqY&t=1882.4s)]
