# Stavros Breaks Down The Election For Theo Von | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc)
*  Theo Von at a wild take about the Greeks, the blacks. Oh, this was awesome. It was hilarious. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=0.0s)]
*  Are some people say people say that the Greeks are the blacks of Europe? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=6.16s)]
*  Bring up someone. Google. No, I will say that all the time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=14.4s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=18.32s)]
*  But anyway, let's watch Theo Von with with Stavi baby. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=24.72s)]
*  Think when they talk about Trump, because but what is it? I kind of have to wonder what do people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  be scared of? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  I can tell you right. I mean, the thing so for me, you know, I didn't love either candidate here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=36.16s)]
*  I didn't I really didn't understand being enthusiastic about either candidate. I think, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  you know, I'm not a Trump guy. Obviously, I think he is dangerous and the things that I'm scared of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=48.32s)]
*  the most. And the thing that made me that made me lean towards Kamala was more than anything was the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Supreme Court and that it would be if it's put under like far right control for the next however [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  long. We've already seen, you know, women's right to, you know, over their bodies, the abortion, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=67.76s)]
*  you know, Roe v. Wade's been overturned, which I think is really dangerous. That's going to like [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=72.48s)]
*  really affect women's health care. Already in states that banned it, you see they're getting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=76.72000000000001s)]
*  less just general OB GYN care because it's more dangerous to be a doctor in those states. So we [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  don't think about shit that trickles down. So like, it's harder to get just general health care, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  let alone abortion in Texas now for women. And that's only going to get harder in rural states. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=93.92s)]
*  And I think for me, that was the number one issue. That's really scary to me, especially with the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=98.72s)]
*  border being open. They're letting rapists in. You know what I'm saying? Though it's like you're just [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  well, yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's the best time to repeal that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=107.44s)]
*  If we're going to follow your logic and you claim they got this coming in, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=112.16s)]
*  maybe we should also keep abortion. But, you know, I think we got plenty of homegrown [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=116.16s)]
*  rapists too. But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We've got our own. Sure. We've got some heirloom [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=121.12s)]
*  American rapists for sure. But I think that's my, the number one thing that scares me is about that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=128.32s)]
*  because it's not only, that's the first step. And I think you can really see stuff that we take for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=134.24s)]
*  granted as progress, gay marriage is another thing. There's a really weird cultural, I think this is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  what happens anytime the party that's backed by the, you know, the powers that be, big business, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=144.4s)]
*  the rich people, the richest people in the world want far right politicians. And I think if they [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  still absolutely without question, I feel like tech is now I just feel like the party is a huge, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=158.56s)]
*  is a huge Trump. That's a good point. I think rich people will support whoever's in power, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=166.24s)]
*  number one, but they want to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich. They've been really [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=170.64s)]
*  good at doing it. The biggest issue, I think the reason the Democrats lost is because they pretend [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=174.88s)]
*  that there is no problem. I think inflation, I think a big, a big part of inflation is that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  companies realize they can just charge. He's great for normies like you know, that's like [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=186.72s)]
*  Stobby does a great job with this shit. I try to do a decent job with this in my normal interactions [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  with people or when I'm on like somebody else's stream or in mainstream media, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=197.04s)]
*  obviously on my own stream, it's a little bit different and people will inevitably piss me off [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=202.4s)]
*  and then clip my reaction to be like, has on is always angry, but like, yeah, this is, this is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=207.92s)]
*  solid. Marjorie Warren say it's somebody else's fault. A lot of it's price gouging. That's, you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=213.6s)]
*  know, that's true. And the, but you should, everything gets so much more expensive and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=218.0s)]
*  companies are, some of it is just real inflation, but some of his companies are hiding behind [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=222.48s)]
*  inflation. And like there was no Democrats did nothing to stop price gouging, right? They didn't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=226.56s)]
*  even say they were going to do it. You can't tell people that things are going good when they're [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=231.44s)]
*  just clearly not. The most important issue for people is that things are more, they have no [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=236.56s)]
*  healthcare wage inequalities out of control. We're not the, what people's wages have not kept pace [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=240.88s)]
*  with how much bosses are earning. Yeah. Well, what percent of me, Bernie Sanders said greatly that he [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=247.6s)]
*  thought if AI starts to happen for companies, right? So companies are making more money. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=252.4s)]
*  We don't need you anymore. You know what I mean? So you don't get anything and we keep all the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=256.8s)]
*  profits. And I do think, I mean, I think we talked about it a little bit last time where it's like, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=260.16s)]
*  AI as a tool, I can do creative shit. It's so weird when it's like, it should be making normal [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=265.12s)]
*  people's lives easier. It shouldn't just be for rich people to be able to charge less. Like there [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=271.44s)]
*  should be some protections for workers and we should be able to like, you know, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=277.44s)]
*  No disrespect this, Davi, but if you need a comedian to guide you through a thought, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=282.32s)]
*  maybe you shouldn't talk about politics talking about Theo, brother, it doesn't matter. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=285.84s)]
*  You're speaking to a reality that doesn't exist and, and avoiding the reality that's in front of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=289.76s)]
*  you, whether you like it or not, whether you like it or not, many Americans are dumb and completely [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=294.88s)]
*  disillusioned with politics and don't like to think about it. And the ones that do like to think [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=302.8s)]
*  about it want an oversimplified explanation. Your conversation with face banks made me understand [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  the mind of the average guy. The reality of the matter is like face banks or Theo Vaughn, these are [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  both multimillionaires. They're very successful. They're not the average person, but they do think [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=316.72s)]
*  closer to the average person. They, their, their thought process is closer to the average person [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  than the average chatter in here. If you're in here, you're not an average person. You might be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=329.28s)]
*  a formative member of the working class. You might be an essential worker. You might be a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=334.4s)]
*  delivery driver. Many of you are, but the reality of matter is you're a little bit of a freak because [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  you want to not only be educated on politics, but you also have a unique perspective. You have a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=343.44s)]
*  well-defined ideological framework that you operate off of. Okay. The moment that you recognize class [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=348.96s)]
*  politics or country is the moment where you have transcended beyond the average democratic party [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=354.8s)]
*  operative even. Okay. You have transcended beyond understanding politics at a level that is in my [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  opinion, even more successful and smarter, more intelligent than the, the average Ivy league college [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=368.48s)]
*  graduate that works in the DNC. Speaking to the DNC and also people that are, you know, working [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=377.36s)]
*  within the democratic parties, uh, institutions, there's plenty of them in here as well. I know for [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=382.96s)]
*  a fact, there's plenty of members of the media in here as well. The problem is there's a lot of you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  out there. Your voices are simply not heard because those who are in control of the institutions [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=394.08s)]
*  don't give up. They don't want to hear it, but never forget dumbing down politics is definitely [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  a smart thing to do. A lot of people who think of themselves as like, uh, you know, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=406.72s)]
*  deep thinkers and intellectuals because they watch some, uh, debate streamer comb through, uh, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=412.72s)]
*  pages and pages of Wikipedia to develop talking points to win, uh, in a rapid fire argument where [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=419.92s)]
*  you can gish gallop as many talking points as possible. Look to someone like myself and say, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  Hassan doesn't have any deep thoughts. He's not, he's not a serious thinker. He doesn't, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=432.16s)]
*  he hasn't really considered a lot of the things he's talking about. He's out of his element. He's [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=436.32000000000005s)]
*  out of his depth. Yeah. Why am I always right? And your favorite content creator is always wrong then. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  How the does that happen? And it's the same principle behind Alan Lichtman too is like, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  what's going on? Or maybe I'm just trying to simplify some of these more complicated subjects [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  in a, in a way to make it more appealing and easier to consume for the broadest audience [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=456.48s)]
*  possible. I don't try to make you feel smart by, uh, you know, giving you certain talking points. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=463.12s)]
*  Okay. I try to explain stuff to you so you can internalize it on your own and then maybe even [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  go back and, and do some research on your own as well. I try to push you in the appropriate [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=475.52s)]
*  direction. I want to see Alex O'Connor Hassan conversation. Isn't that guy, the British, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=480.72s)]
*  twink with the mustache who really, really likes Richard Dawkins and shit. Is that who that is? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=485.92s)]
*  He sounds pretty, uh, well read. I can't tell, but, uh, I, I do think that he's, I mean, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  I think his is like, um, I think his, his admiration for like a lot of these, uh, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  super, a lot of these atheists, uh, is, is a little bit weird to me. Joshua Cittarello would [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  be a great guest. I've had Josh on the stream many, many years ago and I've been meaning to try and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  figure out a way to do his podcast, his new podcast. I don't know if he likes you, but I don't keep up [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=516.88s)]
*  with him. He probably doesn't. I can still talk to him though. What is it? Doom scroll. I went to an [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=521.12s)]
*  atheism conference once they preach about how lobbying was actually good and I was radicalized [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  down a different path that way. He had brace on. I'd be surprised if he, no, Josh has asked me to [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=530.16s)]
*  be on the podcast before he even started the podcast. Of course I know Josh. I've had Josh [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=534.64s)]
*  on the stream many, many years ago. I liked Josh a lot. We've just been meaning to, we've been trying [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  to, we've been trying to put it together. Have you ever talked to J reg? No, you should be able to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=546.48s)]
*  buy a house. All these regular issues that weren't really hit on. It was just, well, you got to vote [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=551.68s)]
*  for us because the other person's worse. And even though I think that is true, that's not a winning [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=558.0s)]
*  message. That's nothing, especially when the other side is offering, they're at least saying [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=562.32s)]
*  shit's bad. Well, yeah, they're saying it's for the- Are you a theist? I would consider myself an [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=566.56s)]
*  atheist, but I still respect religion and see a need for them. No, I just, I don't give a shit. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=570.64s)]
*  If people want to believe things that I don't believe in, as long as they're not bothering other [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=575.52s)]
*  people, if they're using that as a moral rudder, I don't have an issue with it. Like I said, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=580.0s)]
*  the only problem I have is with people who do not abide by a secular standard. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=585.76s)]
*  Okay. And I also, on the other side, do not appreciate people who uphold secularism [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=592.24s)]
*  as a way to harm people's religious process. That's it. I have time and time again, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=598.64s)]

*  after all, a bunch of things that I believe the overwhelming majority of human beings do not. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=615.2s)]
*  I'll give you one example, capitalism. Most people think capitalism is dope. Okay. People that I love, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=621.12s)]
*  people that I admire, people that I think are awesome people, people that I interact with on [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=627.84s)]
*  a daily basis, the overwhelming majority, if not damn near entirety of that group of people believes [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=632.72s)]
*  that capitalism is real. Some people believe meritocracy is real. Right. And for me, that doesn't [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=639.92s)]
*  stop me from having a normal conversation with them. And I think that that is the way I operate. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=646.56s)]

*  something's wrong and they're saying some shit. In my opinion, they're trying to make it culture [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=678.24s)]
*  war stuff. They're trying to divide people who should be on the same side by saying, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=683.44s)]
*  Oh, people are bad when it's like the people trying to feel rich people. That's how it's always been. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xre5jMFx0fc&t=688.48s)]
