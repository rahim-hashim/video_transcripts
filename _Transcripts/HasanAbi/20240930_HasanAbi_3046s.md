# Hurricane Helene Reveals Sad Secrets | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo)
*  My point is, my point is, there are so many conspiracy brain losers out there, because they've been duped into refusing to acknowledge what the truth is. Okay, we're so far removed from that. And it's the same principle behind as well, which we also analyze like it's a naturally occurring phenomenon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=0.0s)]
*  I do feel as though like the coverage does not match the devastation. You know what I mean? It almost feels as normalized. It almost feels as normalized as like in to a certain degree. Because the thing I the thing I mean about this is that I'm not saying the media is not covering it at all. Of course it is. But this kind of would be like week long, if not month long news coverage, like a lot of you are younger. So I think that's the thing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=19.1s)]
*  So you probably don't recall Katrina. Okay, this is like a yearly event. Now. It almost feels like we are living in a post Katrina world where Katrina is a yearly event. And, and the scale of the devastation is Katrina across multiple territories. And it's like not as big it doesn't feel like it's as big as a story like you had, bro, you had Kanye West on the phone trying to do fundraisers on television when that was happening. That's why he had that famous moment. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=49.1s)]
*  Where he was like George W. Bush doesn't care about black people like that's that's from that. That's how big of a thing that was. And I do think now I do think now it's like it's almost like Sandy Hook normalized. And now in that in that same degree, it all like it just, you know, it holds the attention of people for like maybe a day, maybe two days. And then we just move on. I don't know. I don't know if it's like also because like our attention span is like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=79.1s)]
*  limited I don't know if it's because we you know, I've just been thinking about it a lot I don't know if it's because of our attention spans that are limited now as a consequence of like tic toc or whatever. But it is kind of weird. And I don't know if it's because like, I'm not saying that this is like a deliberate effort to like normalize. It's like hyper normalization of these kinds of like climate atrocities. I don't think that but it is strange. It is strange to me that it's like, I mean, it isn't as bad as Katrina that was half a Louisiana coastline that was destroyed, bro, there's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=109.1s)]
*  Asheville is gone, brother, like Asheville is gone. As for North Carolina is gone. The dam broke is over, you know, it's just like fully underwater at this point. It's crazy. It I think it is definitely Katrina level. Yeah. Regarding coverage bridges are rendering entire regions virtually entirely inaccessible by land. There's no power. There's no internet. I'm sure information will be scarce coming out of it from the ground versus being able to get aerial shots. Like we have this is like apocalyptic levels of destruction as a chatter put it and I I don't know, man. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  It's just it's really tough. It is really, really, really tough. And one aspect of this story that's really tough is that like we are directly causing it with anthropogenic climate change. Okay. As as as the world heats up more and more, I guess in the simplest terms, directly as a consequence of our [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=168.82s)]
*  emissions, things that scientists keep saying are going to happen are happening over and over again. And a big chunk of people, a big chunk of people are just like, nah, I'm different dog. We're different. It's fine. The only client like the most significant, most consequential climate change policy that we have seems to be the border policy. You know, like a more military, a more militant border, a more white nativist, more militant border policy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=191.66s)]
*  Is like the only thing that we are setting up for, like we're not hardening our infrastructure even enough and half of the entire political field basically denies it's even happening and is like trying to legislate away the mention of it. Like you look at Florida. It's like they're too busy being like, nah, climate change is fake. Like, don't say it. Don't say it's real, please. And it blows my mind. Fango lives are Evie correspondences. Easy way to explain climate change makes storm stronger. Global warming makes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=221.66s)]
*  water warmer, warmer water has more energy. So storms passing over that water gain more energy from the warmer water, which means there's stronger storms. We've added several billion nuclear but the energies to the ocean a couple decades. Yes, that is a good way to explain it. Thank you. Yeah. That's also partially due to climate change migration. No, I know. I know. That's why I'm saying like our border security measures is a climate change infrastructure hardening initiative. It's because there are going to be more and more like people [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=251.66s)]
*  that previously worked in like the agricultural sector that are not going to be able to work. So they're going to migrate as their economic their economy is devastated. They're going to migrate north. They're going to come to America because there there is ecological disaster there and they don't have any they don't have any money to even harden their infrastructure nor overcome the damage that climate change is causing in those regions. But what is crazy about this? What is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=281.66s)]
*  crazy about this beyond that? I don't know what's crazy about it is beyond the the migration patterns, right? We literally have basically at this point, you know, developing nation levels of infrastructure in the wealthiest nation on the planet, dude, like it's wild to me that we just straight up have a situation where half of the political population have to have of our [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=311.66s)]
*  government is like it doesn't exist. So don't do anything about it. The other half is like it does exist, but we are going to be susceptible to political pressure from the right and from money to interest like in the oil and gas sector. So we're going to keep drilling baby. We're going to keep fracking drill baby [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=341.46s)]
*  drill, but like, you know, gay version. Okay. And we're we hear you, we see you, we want to trust the science, but also we're not going to trust the science that much because as long as it harms the bottom line of like oil and gas giants, then we're going to not trust the science [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=357.36s)]
*  that much right build back better wasn't going to solve all this but Jesus Christ that Joe mentioned got the data that builds a Democratic senator. This is insane levels of destruction. Yeah, so you're right about that. And I do think that like, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=375.2s)]
*  in a just world, he would be held to count alongside the entirety of the Republican Party. Right? How are immigration and disasters of hurricanes correlated? No, you're looking at one aspect of how climate change and and the once in a lifetime like weather events like climate [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=387.44s)]
*  change created catastrophes occur in America, but you're failing to consider that when this happens in like Mexico, it's even more devastating. But beyond that, climate change also causes drought in a lot of places, especially in Latin America. Not only do they not have enough money to harden their infrastructure against this sort of thing when this kind of devastation occurs, and it completely collapses entire ecologies. But beyond that, you have climate refugees, you have people that can't afford to live in the country. And so you're going to have to look at the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=409.28s)]
*  people that are being displaced, who are going to be displaced, and what are they doing? They're migrating to the north, and they're migrating to the north. And they're migrating to the north because they can no longer land because the land is no longer tenable. So what do they do? They migrate, they migrate further north. So you have climate refugees, right? You have climate refugees that are like, are coming to America because like at least there's still land that you can work on and make money on. So that's how millions of people are displaced. And America knows that like, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=439.28s)]
*  the carbon emissions causing anthropogenic climate change and global warming in general, and like refusing to do anything about it. And as a matter of fact, having that full knowledge, and then only using that knowledge to create PR structures against it so that you can create an environment where like 30 to 40% of the entire nation doesn't even believe it's real, right? That's what they did since the 80s. They were like, oh, this is going to be a problem in the future. So let's make sure that it doesn't become a problem [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=469.28s)]
*  for us and our bottom line by creating an entire system in media to just lie to the American public and to say that it's sick. And that is one of the negative consequences of this reality because you're seeing biblical levels of destruction. Okay, you're watching biblical levels of destruction. And what are some Americans saying about it? How are some people reckoning with this reality? How are some people dealing with this reality? They're dealing with it by [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=499.28s)]
*  blaming, like weather machines or something. And it's no different than, okay, here's why it's no different than they're not a natural disaster. But we analyze it like it's a natural disaster. Why? Because we are completely captive to corporate interests in that regard. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=529.28s)]
*  manufacturers make too much money for us to ever actually deal with the that happens in this country. So in that situation, if you are going to refuse to see the reality of the matter, like at the top of the hour, there's a three minute abric if you're refusing to see that if you're [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=547.8s)]
*  refusing to reckon with that reality, then you know, you're probably going to get hit with a three minute abric instead of defending yourself against that outbreak by subscribing last day of September, by the way, for $4 or for free with a twitch prime or by getting gifted us up if you're lucky. Okay, here's a three minute abric now. Anyway, Hurricane Katrina category five major hurricane 1392 fatalities 135 missing Hurricane Helene category four major hurricane 121 fatalities 673 missing so it doesn't seem like it's as bad as Katrina. Who [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=564.92s)]
*  does? What are we doing? Like, it's pretty bad still dude, that is crazy. And I think it's more than 673 missing, by the way, I think those numbers are incorrect. We don't even know the full numbers at this point, don't we? It's also it's also where it's also where the hurricane hit like it's not even the coastline in this in this situation is crazy. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=594.92s)]
*  Okay, listen, I'm gonna run the three minute abric now, by the way. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, you have to you have to understand something. Okay, all jokes aside, three minute abric, blah, blah, blah. What I'm trying to explain here is this, okay, if you are refusing to reckon with the reality in front of you, you are going to look for alternative realities as to why things are happening. And that's why there are so many conspiratorial psychopaths out there. Okay, that's my point. My point is, my point is, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=616.12s)]
*  there are so many conspiracy brain losers out there, because they've been duped into refusing to acknowledge what the truth is. Okay, we're so far removed from that. And it's the same principle behind as well, which we also analyze like it's a naturally occurring phenomenon. We're like, oh, do not look to the actual problem, which is okay, mass arsenal of that are readily available to the public more than there are people. But God forbid you analyze it with the actual root cause of the problem. No, we [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=646.12s)]
*  got to desperately cling on to anything else, anything, and everything we can. Oh, it's got to be door control. We got to give more to the teachers, we got to do this, we got to do that. And that's why so many people at this point, now that they've exhausted all other options, whenever [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=676.12s)]
*  occur, they have, they now go, oh, it's because the shooters, I've imagined that the shooters and people are doing these or, you know, this is government, they actually are doing this because they want to do control, which never happens, by the way, worse of all time, right? So that's it. That's [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=690.24s)]
*  why people hyper focus on like insane. This happened in Hawaii, too. Oh, it must be like that did the fires, it cannot be that the brush is just simply drier than it has ever been. It cannot be like full blown ecological collapse that caused massive wildfires got to be [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=705.88s)]
*  Look at the blue cars, the blue cars didn't light on fire like you. We are purposely making our population and because it's like easier to control and manipulate in some ways, but also simultaneously. This is not tenable. This is not sustainable. Okay, I don't know how to describe it. And it's up is so up is so up in every way in every way, shape and form like the way we analyze the situation is so messed up. Here, this is a Matt Christman quote, talks about it. Okay, these guys that Marshall [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=725.2s)]
*  Charlottesville, these are the people who are aware of the unspoken premise of the sort of zombie neoliberalism that we're living in, which is that we're coming to a point where there's going to be ecological catastrophe, and that it's going to require either massive redistribution of the ill gotten gains of the first [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=755.16s)]
*  world or, and these are the first people who have basically said, Well, if that's the choice, then I choose and they're getting everyone else ready intellectually and emotionally for why that's going to be okay when it happens, why they are not really people, when we're putting all this money into more walls and drones [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  and things to keep them away so that we can wash them with it's because we have been loaded with the ideology that these guys are now starting to express publicly. On the other side of them, we have people who are in who are saying in full voice, no, we have the resource to save everybody to give everybody a decent and worthwhile [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=784.16s)]
*  existence. And that is what we want. And that is the real difference between these two. And you can tell that to the next asshole who tells you that they're actually two sides of the same coin. We are the people who say we have the money, we have the capacity, we have a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=800.16s)]
*  surplus of food, we are the people who can save everybody else. We just choose not to and the problem with neoliberalism and the problem with like the Democratic Party's capitulation to right wing framing on issues is that they are also slaves of the same master, the master of [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=813.16s)]
*  capital. Okay, they are still deeply, they have a deeply vested interest in maintaining this corporate oligopoly, this corporate oligarchy. So they have to make some messages like messaging differences between the Republican Party. But ultimately, that's why every four years you see them [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=829.16s)]
*  bouldering towards more and more right wing framing on these issues. Now, I want to dive into this a little bit further. I want to talk about this a little bit more. In this past month alone, there have been so many issues that the that a competent Democratic Party would [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=849.16s)]
*  literally be messaging around over and over again, to a degree where this would not even be a close race at all. We have we had a that's a that's a control issue. The Democrats could have messaged around it. We forgot about them already. Like it literally happened like what a month ago, two months ago. Okay. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=867.16s)]
*  Nothing, no competent conversation, no competent Democratic leadership on that front at all. Okay, what do we do? We're still we're like, yeah, they're bad. We move on. Okay, all happened. And the Democrats didn't even message around it. Okay. Another thing, Republicans insanely [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=888.16s)]
*  right wing framing on immigration. They went so above and beyond that it was gross to the average person as I told you this would happen with the Haitians are eating dogs and cats nonsense. Okay, that's another issue that the Republicans have completely gotten out of control on with their messaging. A competent Democratic Party should have made mincemeat out of that. Okay, a competent counterbalance. A competent counterbalance to that kind of unrestricted [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=908.16s)]
*  fascist communication is supposed to sit there and say, Do you hear what this person is saying? They're saying your neighbors are eating cats and dogs they're being they're doing like unrestricted, unfettered, okay, white supremacy through and through nothing. No statements whatsoever to the humanity of these Haitian migrants that are literally not even undocumented. They are documented. They are documented immigrants and their status. These guys on the right want to revoke they want to take that [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=938.16s)]
*  away. Okay, so that's another one. And last but not least, or two two other issues, okay. foreign policy, neocon foreign policy back in the day was supposed to be the Republicans that pushed, you know, more war, more war, more devastation, more destruction, more money to the military. Okay, Israel has expanded on its NSEEK and is now doing to Lebanon, what it was doing to Gaza, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=968.16s)]
*  nothing from the Democratic Party, except for full blown unconditional support to Israel. Okay. And last but not least, now we also have ecological disasters as a direct consequence of climate change. And the counterbalance to the Republican Party is also running the drill baby drill attitude. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=998.36s)]
*  Think about that. Those are four key issues, domestic policy and foreign policy, four key issues that the Democrats are supposed to literally be on the opposing side on. And yet when you look at their policy prescriptions, when you look at their policy prescriptions, their answers are no different than the Republican Party. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1021.12s)]
*  Their answers are like maybe lighter, maybe a little bit more understanding. This is a terrifying prospect for the future of the United States of America. Okay, there are key issues to a crazy left person. Yeah, dude, the entire town of Asheville, North Carolina is underwater. And that's just a key issue to a crazy left person, a crazy left person. If you have to be a crazy left person to be like, hey, I find it unconscionable that our key allies are going to be on the other side of the world. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1042.36s)]
*  I mean, the way that the FBI in the Middle East is like pummeling every country in the region with American made with American tax dollars that could be going elsewhere to I don't know, maybe harden your infrastructure ahead of time because you know ecological disaster is imminent. I'm not a I mean, I don't know. I don't know what to say about like the average opinion of the average person then. Or these are key issues to a crazy left person. Key issues such as not going on a national stage and greatly accelerating the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1072.36s)]
*  right wing framing, the white nativist framing built on top of a house of lies. Okay, built on not only it's not even shaky foundation. Okay, it's not a shaky foundation. It's just abject lies right like the idea that undocumented migrants are responsible for more than natural born US [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1102.36s)]
*  citizens. That's not correct. It's just incorrect. These aren't even undocumented immigrants, by the way. These are documented immigrants too, but they are being treated as though they are undocumented. Meanwhile, meanwhile, this is the lib talking point, by the way, anyone that's upset about Biden and Harris's response are getting hit with not their fault. They offered aid to then say should have voted better. Yeah, that's insane, man. That's insane. Believing that climate change is real. When like multiple towns are [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1121.28s)]
*  completely underwater is such a psychotic way of looking at the situation. I don't even know how to deal with it. And that is how we arrive at the viral tweet blaming the flooding in North Carolina on government weather manipulation. Okay, because you are desperately avoiding the truth. You don't want to see the truth. You don't want to see the truth of the matter. You don't want to listen to scientists. You think scientists are gay and lame and lying to you. And when [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1151.28s)]
*  that happens, of course, you're going to find yourself in the throes of like insanity like this easy way to understand immigration and global warming. A single immigrant brings his body temperature to the US therefore making the whole land of the US warmer more energy and therefore making okay stop joking right now come on. Yeah, I saw this I saw this as well. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1181.28s)]
*  Bema said last week it faces nearly $9 billion of shortfall for Hurricane Helene recovery efforts on the same day is real announced an $8.7 billion package from the US our tax dollars are funding Israeli work instead of the investments we desperately need here. Can't do it can't get Congress to do it. You just can't do it. You know, meanwhile, here's another few to the police, by the way, because every single thing I talk about the intersectionality of that is in full display right here the intersectionality of misinformation the intersectionality of that all of the systems [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1197.92s)]
*  that we exist under that are openly being like you you poor police guarding grocery stores while folks are denied the opportunity to purchase baby formula after losing everything is pretty indicative of where we are as a country. Okay, not letting people into the grocery store. That's what they're that's what they're using their funds on great stuff, man. That's what we're using our local funds on. So why didn't you stock up? Why didn't anyone stock up? The store has to follow procedure from the people like you from buying everything up and then suing the store because they bought [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1227.92s)]
*  a bad product. Like there are people immediately being like nah, oh, this guy blocked me. But let's see what he had to say. Matt Wallace. Don't worry guys. Weather modification isn't real. It's just a coincidence that Hurricane Helene is one of the most devastating inland damage storms in history in the hundreds of pro Trump counties in Mass are massively being impacted during those most important election of our lifetimes. Yeah. Obviously the elites would never be evil enough to create hurricanes designed to interfere with democracy. Pay no attention to storms. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1257.92s)]
*  30,000 likes. We're done. We're done. We're done. You cannot come back from this. I think how the are you living in a goddamn mountain and expected for your entire house to flood entire town to flood. It is perfectly understandable. Here's a here's reporting from Asheville, North Carolina from April 2002 or 2022. Okay, let's take a look about how Asheville was presented as a [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1287.92s)]
*  escape from severe climate change impact when it comes to climate. The mountains have always been an attractive place to live and now even more so with climate change, making severe weather events even worse elsewhere. Climate change leading to climate migration. Weather events are becoming crazy all over the world and there's places where they're less crazy. Asheville is fortunate to be one of those places.

*  hearing that climate is a big reason why people are moving here. I think people have noticed and are moving here for to escape wildfires, to escape floods, to escape hurricanes, to escape droughts. Scott Schubert is a local expert in community planning and resilience. Our big three issues of climate change affecting North Carolina are sea level rise, which clearly we're not having a problem with that. Um, but also heavy precipitation and periods of drought. He says those don't affect [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1347.92s)]
*  us in Asheville as much since we're far from the coast, have the North Fork reservoir for a water supply and the elevation to keep our temperatures mild, not immune to climate change, of course, just less susceptible. And he doesn't think we're anywhere near the peak of climate migration. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1377.92s)]
*  For a random Kenyan farmer has been noticing that his goats are walking further and further for water year over year. And he understands this is a direct result of climate change. How do the hogs not understand this? I think it's understandable for most people to not recognize this because we don't have a [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1392.8000000000002s)]
*  direct relationship with nature. We don't have a direct relationship with the meat that we are consuming. We do not have that direct relationship with nature at all by design. So of course, people don't notice these differences year over year. And as I explained already, there's a [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1407.52s)]
*  multi billion dollar initiative. There is a multi billion dollar initiative to also make people and refuse to reckon with the reality because the reality harms capital interest. The reality harms the bottom line of the oil and gas industry. Okay, the entire world runs on fossil fuels. That's it. Yeah, it's the breaking down of the social connections of consumption caused by capitalism. A dude wrote a whole book about this. Yeah, he did. Like things that you would previously [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1423.52s)]
*  consider insane that, you know, your fellow Americans would believe are now becoming more and more commonplace. Do you not notice that? And if you do notice that, do you not see that as a major problem? Because I certainly do. I definitely do. I find it very I find it damaging the public discourse in [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1453.52s)]
*  general, I find it terrifying that more and more people are just like, literally desperately clinging on to whatever they can desperately clinging on to whatever kind of misinformation they can, because of our abject powerlessness in the face of these systems that are turning out these results, no matter what you say and do, you know, where will we go from here?

*  Yeah, good morning. Today's without power, cell phone service, we're safe drinking water for so many people here in western North Carolina. Right now we're in historic Biltmore Village, a popular shopping and dining enclave here in Asheville, which was submerged in water. There was debris all over the place and a muddy mess left behind. This stretches for miles and miles. One official calling the damage biblical devastation. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1503.8400000000001s)]
*  This morning, the toll climbing after Helene barreled through the southeast, the massive storm, more than 91 people from Florida to Virginia in Buncombe County, North Carolina, our affiliate WSLC capturing the scope of the damage from above. At least 30 people declared dead, dozens more unaccounted for. These response teams are working around the clock to make rescues to access neighborhoods. The extreme floods washing away homes and bridges. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1528.24s)]

*  The weather it's whether modification conspiracies are not new. They have escaped Twitter for a very long time. I know. The problem is, I think more and more people now believe it. That's the issue. It's getting way more broader play, in my opinion. Now I have no data to back this up. It just feels that way. And maybe I'm wrong. But yes, they have they have existed for quite a while. But like things that were relegated to the Alex Jones, like ham radio broadcasts are now [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1573.16s)]
*  being publicized by like, many different independent media outlets that have broad reach reach that previously like, a lot of this reach was stunted in the past. Okay, you had to like have [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  a AM radio broadcast exactly know when to tune in, you had to be really invested in the conspiracy theories. Now you can just like accidentally reach them online on your TikTok feed, you can accidentally reach them and be duped by them online. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1618.24s)]
*  On your YouTube feed on your Twitter feed, if you're on Twitter, like it things that used to be limited to like obscure forums and and am radio broadcasts in the past are now broadly at the forefront of not mainstream media necessarily, but at least like the only other massive, very impactful way of getting information is just like everywhere online everywhere.

*  Unprecedented tragedy that requires an unprecedented response. In Asheville, many residents growing desperate cell service and potable water out for days. This is apocalyptic, not just for canton, but the entire region and Canton mayor Zip Smathers telling ABC News, it's nearly impossible to reach emergency management due to the cell service outage [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1663.2s)]

*  Yeah, I mean, dude, dude, it's so inconsiderate when climate protesters block roads is just like, it's so inconsiderate when, you know, climate, I'm glad that we're like arresting the only people that are like, Hey guys, you should pay attention to this because it's gonna be one day. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1698.64s)]
*  Yeah. Meanwhile, here, here's a major contributor to this, by the way. It's actually crazy how quickly we went from people saying Jack Dorsey brought a liberal bias to Twitter to whatever this is. And we hear nothing about it. Okay. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1716.64s)]
*  Like, Jack Dorsey never in a fucking million years behaved in this outwardly liberal of a fashion. Okay. In the way that Elon Musk very openly communicates like the most unfiltered unrestricted right wing far right sometimes neo Nazi sentiment. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1729.64s)]
*  And it's odd, don't you think it's odd that, you know, we always suspect that there is a liberal bias, but when there is an overt right wing bias, nobody even talks about it. It's like, what are you supposed to do? There's nothing you could do about it either. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1747.64s)]
*  Nuremberg style trials for the oil and gas executives, brother. There is a lot of people right now that deserve Nuremberg style trials, not just the oil and gas executives. When we're talking about this hurricane. Yes. But then there's also the Nuremberg style trials for all of those who are in defense of Israel's literally Nuremberg inducing actions, you know, fourth Reich style in the region in the Middle East. Yeah. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1761.64s)]
*  Yeah. Elon Musk was even saying the craziest part about Elon Musk is that he was propped up as this like billionaire Tony Stark style guy by liberals. Okay. This supposed billionaire Tony Stark, who's going to save the world. He's going to send us the Mars or whatever. And he's going to save the planet from climate change. Right. He's got EVs. He's got his brothers got a solar panel company. And it's, it's crazy because he was having a conversation with Donald Trump. And even then he was like repeating climate misinformation. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=1786.64s)]
*  Elon was saying climate change disinfo during that Trump interview even and that's supposed to be the one non idiotic position he holds. Yes. I mean in 2017 he quit that Trump White House Council over climate change and now he's talking to the dude and talking nonsense about climate change saying we don't have to worry until we reach 1000 ppm. Yeah, he said climate change won't be a problem until the air catches on fire. Like he it was great man. Yeah. Until until you get headaches from breathing the air. It won't be an issue. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

*  consider the more invasive parts of government outreach the [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2435.0s)]
*  potential limits on free speech on social platforms? Wait, what? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2436.96s)]
*  I'm still left to advocate for governments to do this sort of [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2440.4s)]
*  stuff. But it's only part I'm worried about due to some [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2442.44s)]
*  personal reasons. What I don't know what you mean by social [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2444.28s)]
*  media outreach. I don't know how we're going to fix this. But I [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2448.2000000000003s)]
*  don't think limiting information is the solution to this problem. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2452.04s)]
*  But I do think hardening our underlying educational [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2455.3599999999997s)]
*  infrastructure is the solution to this problem. But we're not [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2459.2799999999997s)]
*  doing that either. Like the way I explain it is like this. I like [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2462.9199999999996s)]
*  Alex Jones as an entertainer. I can consume Alex Jones content [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2468.08s)]
*  as an entertaining figure. Right? Oh, I thought you were [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2473.7599999999998s)]
*  talking about social platform. Like free speech restrictions on [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2477.08s)]
*  social platform. I don't know what you mean about like meat [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2481.0s)]
*  consumption. When I say the government needs to deal with [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2482.8s)]
*  that, this has to be dealt with at the systemic level. I'm [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2486.52s)]
*  talking about the meat providers and like limiting the amount of [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2489.4s)]
*  meat that we are limiting the amount of meat that we are [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2492.52s)]

*  additional regulatory checks on the ways in which the ways the [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2501.6000000000004s)]
*  ways in which agricultural production works in this country. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2507.32s)]
*  But that is like one of the scariest aspects of this process [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2510.3599999999997s)]
*  to begin with. Since you said it was the scarier part for you [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2515.2s)]
*  regarding government reach. Sorry for confusing you law. But [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  in terms of like social media communication. Oh, I don't know [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2521.16s)]
*  what you mean by that. Asana is not a moral person. He admits [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2524.56s)]
*  veganism is the moral responsibility. Do not get your [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2528.56s)]

*  issues with animal meat consumption. This conversation [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2537.36s)]
*  is getting so far off base now. God damn it, vegans, you [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2540.1200000000003s)]

*  addition to FEMA includes the Federal Communications Commission [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2565.32s)]

*  what I was saying is like, I am at least like well educated [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2584.2400000000002s)]
*  enough to know what Alex Jones is saying is cuckoo for cocoa [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2587.96s)]
*  puffs. So from that position, I can I can enjoy his commentary [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2590.8s)]
*  purely as entertainment like as a crazy person. But [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2595.28s)]
*  unfortunately, given the the lack of education for many [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2598.32s)]
*  Americans, and given the way that it currently works in the [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2603.36s)]
*  United States of America, there are plenty of people who do [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2606.96s)]
*  believe everything he's saying, and don't just treat it as like [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2609.0s)]

*  Yeah, it's because at the top of the hour, there's a three [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2753.92s)]
*  minute break. And that's my biggest gotcha for like 30,000 [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2755.7200000000003s)]
*  people in here. And they probably develop a little bit of [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2758.92s)]
*  resentment. Maybe they have a little bit of anxiety at the top [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2761.88s)]
*  of the hour because they know what's coming. They feel it in [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2764.92s)]
*  their heart and get worried that chatter came to you with good [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2766.66s)]
*  intentions and use them for a segue. Yes, because I'm a bad [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2769.52s)]
*  person. Next question. Anyway, you might be wondering Hassan, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2772.0s)]
*  how do I how do I harden my security against the top of the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2775.2000000000003s)]
*  hour ad break? That's three minutes long. I want to [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2779.36s)]
*  uninterrupted broadcast experience. The answer is simple. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2780.92s)]
*  For $4 you can avoid the top of the hour ad breaks by [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2783.6s)]
*  subscribing. Or if you don't have $4 for free, you can do [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2786.18s)]
*  that by connecting your Amazon Prime account to your Twitch [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2789.22s)]
*  account where you get one free prime subscription a month. Use [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2791.22s)]
*  it on your favorite broadcaster. You can also get gifted a sub [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2794.18s)]
*  orbital pyramid. They give you the five tier one gifted subs. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2797.54s)]
*  Or if you give the sub twitch also I think gives a sub as [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2801.46s)]
*  well. I don't know if they're still doing that. Maybe they're [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2804.74s)]
*  not anymore. It's the last day of September. Here's the three [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2806.46s)]

*  people saying missing belt loop? You have to give five subs [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2812.8199999999997s)]
*  minimum for Twitch to give a random sub amount. Oh, yeah. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2815.42s)]
*  suspiciously the random sub amount that was giving is one [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2818.54s)]
*  every time one of the brave teams is volunteer watching. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2821.42s)]

*  anyway. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2828.2200000000003s)]
*  Justin, thank you for the five syntax or they give the five [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=2830.14s)]

*  Are there any more resources the federal government would be [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=3021.7000000000003s)]

*  stepped down because he saw the fucking poll numbers. We're gonna [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=3038.58s)]
*  we're gonna move on to Israel in a second because Israel is doing [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjSa2qlCpo&t=3041.2599999999998s)]
