*  morning, kind of definitely hung over [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=456.0s)]
*  and doing a thousand calories. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=458.0s)]

*  dinner but Austin [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=482.0s)]
*  Cho had no idea the value of the paper money [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=484.0s)]
*  he was holding. So Austin Cho paid for dinner. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=486.0s)]
*  Hassan wanted to pay for [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=488.0s)]
*  dinner. I'm going to leverage that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=490.0s)]
*  guilt to get Hassan to buy me designer [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=492.0s)]
*  fashions today without letting [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=494.0s)]
*  him know that Austin actually [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=496.0s)]
*  paid for the food. That's a great idea. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=498.0s)]
*  Just a wee bit of extortion on your friend. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=502.0s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=504.0s)]

*  at you as you? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=598.0s)]
*  Chotomate is also like a more aggressive version. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=600.0s)]
*  It's more casual to say choto. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=602.0s)]
*  Who hit you with the chotomate? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=604.0s)]

*  It was a cocktail that had dashi broth [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=700.0s)]
*  and tomato juice as the main base. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=702.0s)]

*  Dude I think, oh my god [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1712.0s)]
*  this is literally across the street from where [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1714.0s)]
*  we are, I think that's [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1716.0s)]
*  literally the same neighborhood where we are [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1718.0s)]
*  the AirVnV is. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1720.0s)]
*  Or was. Yes. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1722.0s)]
*  We still ended up [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1724.0s)]
*  staying in the same place. We were gonna [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1726.0s)]
*  stay at a different hotel. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1728.0s)]
*  But that was like a little too far. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1730.0s)]
*  Right it was too south or something from [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1732.0s)]
*  it's a more central location. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1734.0s)]
*  It was too northeast yeah. Or no it was too [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1736.0s)]
*  northeast. It would have been in Ginza it would have been kind of [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1738.0s)]
*  a pain to get out here every day. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1740.0s)]
*  Okay well how long does that take? I mean everywhere we go [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1742.0s)]
*  it's gonna be a 20 minute ride anyway. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=1744.0s)]

*  There we go, hold on. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3472.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep this so 100. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3474.0s)]
*  I think I'm too gentle for this. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3476.0s)]
*  Do we have to get the foot balance? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3478.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3480.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3482.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3484.0s)]
*  Stop, stop, he's going to explain. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3486.0s)]
*  He asked us if we just want [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3488.0s)]
*  fish or do we just want to order... [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3490.0s)]
*  Do we like, do we want to actively [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3492.0s)]
*  fish? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3494.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3496.0s)]
*  Let's discuss for a second. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3498.0s)]
*  Can you give us a few minutes? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3500.0s)]
*  There's ethical considerations at play right now. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3502.0s)]
*  Luca, we got [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3504.0s)]
*  people who don't want to fish anymore. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3506.0s)]
*  I will fish first and somebody else can eat it. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3508.0s)]
*  That's what I wanted to do. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3510.0s)]
*  No, that's what I wanted to do. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3512.0s)]
*  Fish so-so-not? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3514.0s)]
*  Who is having ethical, gentle considerations? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3516.0s)]
*  Will? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3518.0s)]
*  Austin? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3520.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep it 100 with you guys. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3522.0s)]
*  There is a Toriki-zoku next door [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3524.0s)]
*  and that place is fire. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3526.0s)]
*  What kind of place is that? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3528.0s)]
*  Streaming the people fishing. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3530.0s)]
*  How about [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3532.0s)]
*  how about [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3534.0s)]
*  how about I catch it? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3536.0s)]
*  You can't catch or release. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3538.0s)]
*  You can't catch. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3540.0s)]
*  No, you cannot catch or release. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3542.0s)]
*  You are not allowed to release the fish you catch. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3544.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3546.0s)]
*  So they're really doomed. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3548.0s)]
*  I mean they're going to die anyway. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3550.0s)]
*  I [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3552.0s)]
*  I [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3554.0s)]
*  in the spirit of this [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3556.0s)]
*  restaurant [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3558.0s)]
*  I think it's okay. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3560.0s)]
*  You have your [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3562.0s)]
*  your own fish. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3564.0s)]
*  I'm just going to be honest. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3566.0s)]
*  I feel a sadness but I also feel an obligation [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3568.0s)]
*  because we want to catch it. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3570.0s)]
*  You don't want to catch but you can eat. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3572.0s)]
*  He's saying he'll catch [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3574.0s)]
*  for you while you eat. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3576.0s)]
*  Okay, so what happens after we catch it? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3578.0s)]
*  I'm hungry. Let's start here. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3580.0s)]
*  Who's hungry? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3582.0s)]
*  You'll eat? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3584.0s)]
*  I can eat but I'm not going to eat seafood. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3586.0s)]
*  Okay, so [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3588.0s)]
*  I'll eat. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3590.0s)]
*  You'll eat? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3592.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3594.0s)]
*  Now who here besides you [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3596.0s)]
*  won't eat seafood? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3598.0s)]
*  I do struggle with eating [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3600.0s)]
*  if it wasn't so close to the depth of the fish. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3602.0s)]
*  It's going to taste bad. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3604.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3606.0s)]
*  Seriously, before we came to a restaurant [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3608.0s)]
*  where we catch fish, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3610.0s)]
*  it's not a secret that I don't eat seafood. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3612.0s)]
*  I knew that I wasn't going to eat. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3614.0s)]
*  I didn't realize that no one would help me. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3616.0s)]
*  We need that. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3618.0s)]
*  If [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3620.0s)]
*  Oscar was literally eating a sandwich as we walked out. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3622.0s)]
*  If it must be done, it must be done. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3624.0s)]
*  Hear me out. If you're having concerns about paying, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3626.0s)]
*  let's just get one round of drinks and then bounce. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3628.0s)]
*  Okay, nobody [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3630.0s)]
*  has answered, do we [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3632.0s)]
*  have to kill the fish too? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3634.0s)]
*  No, you don't have to kill the fish. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3636.0s)]
*  He hasn't even explained the process yet. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3638.0s)]
*  Because we had [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3640.0s)]
*  the ethical dilemma [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3642.0s)]
*  here. You can also prepare it if you want [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3644.0s)]
*  but there's two fishing methods. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3646.0s)]
*  One you have the fishing pool and hook fishing [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3648.0s)]
*  and [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3650.0s)]
*  on the second floor you can do bait [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3652.0s)]
*  fishing. Does the fish die when we eat it? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3654.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3656.0s)]
*  Maybe we can. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3658.0s)]
*  Is there any part of the fish [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3660.0s)]
*  that it can live without? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3662.0s)]
*  We eat a part of it and release it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3664.0s)]
*  You want to permanently disable the fish? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3666.0s)]
*  Here's my thing, I will explain [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3668.0s)]
*  why I'm feeling [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3670.0s)]
*  self-conscious. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3672.0s)]
*  It doesn't feel sporting. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3674.0s)]
*  No, it feels cruel. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3676.0s)]
*  I have fished before, I catch fish, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3678.0s)]
*  I eat fish, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3680.0s)]
*  it doesn't feel sporting. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3682.0s)]
*  I don't know, I can't explain my feeling right now. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3684.0s)]
*  Okay, we don't have to get it then. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3688.0s)]
*  We'll just get drinks. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3690.0s)]
*  We'll just have a firefighting chance to save you. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3692.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3694.0s)]
*  Let's do one round of drinks. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3696.0s)]
*  I thought I would be the only one conscientiously objective. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3698.0s)]
*  I will fish if you guys want. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3700.0s)]
*  I will fish. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3702.0s)]
*  I will not eat it but I will fish. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3704.0s)]
*  I'm not going to eat either. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3706.0s)]
*  I said I was going to fish. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3708.0s)]
*  Okay, he'll eat [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3710.0s)]
*  your fish. I'll eat your fish. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3712.0s)]
*  Two fish. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3714.0s)]
*  I don't need to fish. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3716.0s)]
*  I will fish. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3718.0s)]
*  It depends on the fish, we have to pick a good fish. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3720.0s)]
*  Will you eat fish? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3722.0s)]
*  Two is enough. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3726.0s)]
*  If you don't want to do it, you don't have to do it. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3728.0s)]
*  Even one is enough. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3730.0s)]
*  I'm not as good at eating [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3732.0s)]
*  if I don't get fish. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3734.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3738.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3742.0s)]
*  As the saying goes, I got attacked by [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3744.0s)]
*  Pita one time. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3746.0s)]
*  I got attacked by Pita one time. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3748.0s)]
*  They came after me and scrolled through all my pictures [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3750.0s)]
*  and found a time at which I had [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3752.0s)]
*  taken a picture of Eggs Benedict with bacon in it. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3754.0s)]
*  What do you mean they came at you? Like on the streets? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3756.0s)]
*  No, on Twitter. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3758.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought like since Pita person was [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3760.0s)]
*  running after you. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3762.0s)]
*  They found a picture of you. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3764.0s)]
*  I took pictures of Eggs Benedict [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3766.0s)]
*  or something and there was bacon in it. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3768.0s)]

*  something about animals and donating money to it. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3772.0s)]
*  And then they're like, no you don't. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3774.0s)]

*  You're a hypocrite. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3778.0s)]
*  Really funny. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3780.0s)]

*  Yes, I believe so. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3806.0s)]
*  I think a couple of us are going to fish. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3808.0s)]
*  And one person is going to eat the fish. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3810.0s)]

*  I'll have green tea. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3860.0s)]
*  And a beer? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3862.0s)]
*  No, we're going to a boxing gym. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3864.0s)]
*  I should have thrown the drinks at my face. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3866.0s)]
*  I shouldn't drink a beer either then. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3868.0s)]

*  God damn it. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3878.0s)]
*  I thought we were going to go before. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3880.0s)]
*  This makes no sense to eat after. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3882.0s)]
*  Wait, are we not allowed to drink before we go to the gym? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3884.0s)]
*  No, you're just going to be [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3886.0s)]
*  punching at me, remember? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3888.0s)]
*  I can't be drunk when I'm actively defending my face. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3890.0s)]
*  I'm not telling you you shouldn't drink. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3892.0s)]

*  Honestly. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3896.0s)]
*  I punch better when I'm drunk. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3898.0s)]
*  You won't even feel it. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3900.0s)]
*  Do you need one for hair and a dog? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3902.0s)]
*  That's just me. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3904.0s)]

*  I don't think that's the fish after that. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3914.0s)]
*  You know what? If we don't order the fish, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3916.0s)]
*  are you wanting to eat? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3918.0s)]
*  Why are we getting here? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3920.0s)]
*  We're not going to eat the fish. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3922.0s)]

*  Let's go look for maynard. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3934.0s)]
*  We also probably were supposed to have wake and fit. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3936.0s)]
*  I had two blue maynard bits and two blue box drinks. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3938.0s)]
*  We've now bought ourselves an hour of Tommy's Lobby. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3940.0s)]

*  We're canceling this. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3990.0s)]
*  Don't say I didn't try. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3992.0s)]
*  Let the record show. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3996.0s)]
*  I wasn't being difficult. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=3998.0s)]
*  I was willing to do everything beyond. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4000.0s)]
*  Austin just wants the record to show you [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4002.0s)]
*  you were not being a diva. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4004.0s)]
*  No, I wasn't. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4006.0s)]
*  I was going to fish and eat the fish. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4008.0s)]
*  Wait, so now you're going back to eating the fish. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4010.0s)]
*  I'm eating it now. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4012.0s)]
*  No, you're not. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4014.0s)]
*  You want to make a bet right now? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4016.0s)]
*  I'll fish and eat it. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4018.0s)]
*  The end result is just Austin. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4020.0s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4022.0s)]
*  So we've decided [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4024.0s)]
*  that the ethical concerns [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4026.0s)]
*  were too much for people involved [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4028.0s)]
*  where they just didn't feel like [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4030.0s)]
*  catching the fish. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4032.0s)]
*  So we're just going to have this [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4034.0s)]
*  and then also maybe get some [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4036.0s)]
*  what was the thing? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4038.0s)]
*  The fried thing? Tempura. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4040.0s)]
*  Assorted tempura. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4042.0s)]
*  Assorted tempura [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4044.0s)]
*  and some edamame. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4046.0s)]
*  Does anyone else want anything? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4048.0s)]
*  No, let's just get [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4050.0s)]
*  assorted tempura and edamame and then we're going to call it a day. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4052.0s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4054.0s)]

*  I got it [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4982.08s)]
*  Excuse me, may we get one fishing hook? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=4984.08s)]
*  Fishing hook? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5007.08s)]
*  Yeah, fishing hook [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5009.08s)]
*  Can you explain how the fishing works? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5011.08s)]
*  Oh sure sure [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5013.08s)]
*  Not yet, one, one, one [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5015.08s)]
*  You can fish downstairs in this area [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5017.08s)]
*  Here you have to use bait for fishing [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5019.08s)]
*  But downstairs you have to use the bait [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5021.08s)]
*  So the boat is different [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5023.08s)]
*  There's a lot of water over there [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5025.08s)]
*  So like, upstairs is more difficult [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5027.08s)]
*  Downstairs is more difficult [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5029.08s)]
*  Downstairs is like, you can't fish here [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5031.08s)]
*  Okay [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5033.08s)]
*  But upstairs is like, more skilled fishermen [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5035.08s)]
*  It depends on the time [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5037.08s)]
*  Alright, I'll do that [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5039.08s)]
*  I'll do upstairs [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5041.08s)]

*  I want to show the rods and the bait [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5161.08s)]
*  We got the rods right here [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5165.08s)]
*  You want a baby one? Like the little kids use? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5167.08s)]
*  Or do you want an adult one? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5169.08s)]
*  Also little kids use [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5171.08s)]
*  Alright [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5177.08s)]
*  Watch out everybody [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5179.08s)]
*  Is this the hook? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5181.08s)]
*  Is there like a [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5183.08s)]
*  Okay [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5185.08s)]
*  Hold on [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5187.08s)]
*  So you have [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5203.08s)]
*  Seabream, flounder, horse mackerel [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5205.08s)]
*  Japanese lobster, prawn [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5207.08s)]
*  And some other shit over there [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5209.08s)]
*  You have to be ready to put it in the fucking net [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5213.08s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah I got it [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5215.08s)]
*  There's three kinds of fish [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5217.08s)]
*  We don't know which you can catch [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5219.08s)]
*  Okay [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5221.08s)]
*  One is one probably [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5223.08s)]
*  The other one is [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5225.08s)]
*  Three, one, and two [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5227.08s)]
*  Alright, most of the fish are crowding on the right side [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5229.08s)]
*  So you're already at a disadvantage here it seems [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5231.08s)]
*  Come on now [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5239.08s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5241.08s)]
*  Wait what are you doing? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5243.08s)]
*  Oh you made him chase it [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5245.08s)]
*  I don't know [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5247.08s)]
*  He's making it more viable [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5249.08s)]
*  He's making it harder and more enduring [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5251.08s)]
*  It's harder to capture [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5253.08s)]
*  I don't think that's what you're supposed to do by the way [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5255.08s)]
*  Wait what are you doing? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5259.08s)]
*  Don't move [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5261.08s)]
*  Okay I lost the bait [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5263.08s)]
*  Watch out [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5265.08s)]
*  Oh [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5267.08s)]
*  Yeah [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5269.08s)]
*  There's a fan [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5275.08s)]
*  Yeah yeah sure sure [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5277.08s)]
*  Nice to meet you sir [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5281.08s)]
*  Have a good day [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5283.08s)]
*  Okay alright I'm going to bait it again [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5285.08s)]
*  He's at the table [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5289.08s)]
*  Austin is just feeding the fish at this point [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5293.08s)]
*  Alright [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5295.08s)]
*  I know what I did wrong, I'm going to make the adjustments [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5297.08s)]
*  Okay what did you do wrong? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5299.08s)]
*  You dropped it [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5301.08s)]
*  I dropped the bait again [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5303.08s)]
*  Watch out with the hook [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5305.08s)]
*  Oh no [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5311.08s)]
*  What happened? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5313.08s)]
*  What? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5315.08s)]
*  Is the little baby catching this? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5321.08s)]
*  Yeah he did [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5323.08s)]
*  Oh a little baby caught it [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5325.08s)]
*  Probably first try [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5327.08s)]
*  Oh shit [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5329.08s)]
*  Okay the bait keeps dropping [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5331.08s)]
*  Should we put it on? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5333.08s)]
*  Yeah do you need help? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5335.08s)]
*  Maybe put it on further [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5337.08s)]
*  In the process of Austin [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5339.08s)]
*  losing the hook [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5341.08s)]
*  of the bait three times [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5343.08s)]
*  That little kid caught a fish and killed it [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5345.08s)]
*  The little fish and killed it [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5347.08s)]
*  Let me get a picture of you with your son [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5349.08s)]
*  Here we go [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5351.08s)]
*  I'm going to net it too [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5353.08s)]
*  The bait came off again [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5355.08s)]
*  Do you want me to put the bait on? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5357.08s)]
*  No I got it, I have to do this whole thing [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5359.08s)]
*  I must [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5361.08s)]
*  I'm going to net it [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5363.08s)]
*  Don't you dare [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5365.08s)]
*  I'm going to do everything, this is my bait [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5367.08s)]
*  You take the net [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5369.08s)]
*  He's just fattening him up [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5371.08s)]
*  That's what it is, it's an expert fishing move [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5373.08s)]
*  Actually a lot of you don't know this [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5375.08s)]
*  Okay [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5377.08s)]
*  Yeah [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5381.08s)]
*  This is an Okanawa prefecture [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5383.08s)]
*  move that a lot of [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5385.08s)]
*  the old sailors of [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5387.08s)]
*  the past used to do this [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5389.08s)]
*  It's a technique called [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5391.08s)]
*  baiting the fish by fattening them [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5393.08s)]
*  up and making them stupid [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5395.08s)]
*  and beat the stuff [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5397.08s)]
*  Okay I think maybe one thing at a time Austin [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5399.08s)]
*  The bait [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5401.08s)]
*  just came off [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5403.08s)]
*  There's something going on here, let me change the bait [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5405.08s)]
*  because this bait is just not working [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5407.08s)]
*  I think the hook [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5409.08s)]
*  is just a little bit [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5411.08s)]
*  Okay, give me the little trick [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5413.08s)]
*  How's your son doing so far? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5415.08s)]
*  I think he's gay [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5417.08s)]
*  I think he might be [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5419.08s)]
*  He might be into dudes [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5421.08s)]
*  bro, I'm not lying [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5423.08s)]
*  I gave birth [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5425.08s)]
*  I was there for the birth of this [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5427.08s)]
*  baby [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5429.08s)]
*  It's your fault you never taught him how to fish [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5431.08s)]
*  I never taught him how to fish [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5433.08s)]
*  Austin you have five more tries [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5435.08s)]
*  If you fuck it up five more times I'm going in [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5437.08s)]
*  Look at it five more times I'm beating you [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5441.08s)]
*  Yeah of course [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5443.08s)]
*  You have to let it eat it first [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5451.08s)]
*  Have you never fished before? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5453.08s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5455.08s)]
*  Austin's gonna actually [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5457.08s)]
*  actually fall in [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5459.08s)]
*  Yay [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5463.08s)]
*  Good job [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5465.08s)]
*  What do I do with it? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5467.08s)]
*  Oh yeah sure [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5469.08s)]
*  Oh sorry [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5471.08s)]
*  Austin give me the pole [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5473.08s)]
*  I did it [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5475.08s)]
*  Oh wow [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5477.08s)]
*  It's okay [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5479.08s)]
*  Austin watch out I have the whole pole [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5483.08s)]
*  You have to kill it [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5485.08s)]
*  Oh hold it? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5487.08s)]
*  Wow [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5489.08s)]
*  Oh god it's flapping everywhere [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5495.08s)]
*  This is doing wonders for my hatred of fishing [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5497.08s)]
*  Oh there's a celebration [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5503.08s)]
*  Okay so I have to hold the fish again? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5505.08s)]
*  Okay [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5507.08s)]
*  Okay [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5509.08s)]
*  Okay thank you [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5511.08s)]
*  Okay [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5513.08s)]
*  Yeah that felt weird [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5515.08s)]
*  I've fished before and that still felt weird [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5517.08s)]
*  Did you see what happened? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5535.08s)]
*  That's what they were doing [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5537.08s)]
*  Yeah [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5539.08s)]
*  No it's over [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5541.08s)]
*  No it's over [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5543.08s)]
*  I'll go put it in [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5545.08s)]
*  He was crazy [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5555.08s)]
*  I've done deep sea fishing before [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5557.08s)]
*  And this was definitely a different experience [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5559.08s)]
*  I get what you mean when you said [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5563.08s)]
*  There's the sword [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5565.08s)]
*  Yeah when he was killing it it felt pretty bad [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5567.08s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=5569.08s)]

*  Are you eating it too? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6284.08s)]
*  Is that my fish? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6289.08s)]
*  It's giving Jumanji the game of slayin' around. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6292.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6295.08s)]
*  So, in a restaurant, do they normally kill the fish there? [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6301.08s)]
*  No. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6309.08s)]
*  Like, in Japan? [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6311.08s)]
*  Would they... [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6314.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6315.08s)]
*  They source the fish. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6316.08s)]
*  How do they kill it? [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6317.08s)]
*  They just drop it. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6318.08s)]
*  I'm sure there's some fish that they keep alive. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6321.08s)]
*  I went to South Korea. We went to a... [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6323.08s)]
*  We killed a king crab. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6326.08s)]
*  And I couldn't eat it. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6329.08s)]
*  With hammers? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6330.08s)]
*  We didn't kill it. We didn't watch it. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6331.08s)]
*  But we picked it out and they killed it and we ate it. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6332.08s)]
*  And I couldn't... [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6335.08s)]
*  You made a relationship with the crab. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6336.08s)]
*  I couldn't eat the crab. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6337.08s)]
*  I couldn't eat it. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6338.08s)]
*  Are you going to be able to eat this fish? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6340.08s)]
*  I'm going to eat this fish for the stream. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6341.08s)]
*  You didn't name the fish, did you? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6344.08s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6346.08s)]
*  I think in solidarity, we should all pick it. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6347.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6349.08s)]
*  You're a cheery streamer. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6352.08s)]
*  I will throw up. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6353.08s)]
*  Is he dead? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6354.08s)]
*  I'll throw up. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6355.08s)]
*  I'm going to eat the fish for the stream. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6357.08s)]
*  I'll straight up throw up. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6358.08s)]
*  It's a lady. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6361.08s)]
*  I got to listen. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6365.08s)]
*  Oh! [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6366.08s)]
*  What the hell? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6371.08s)]
*  Yay! [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6372.08s)]

*  Happy birthday! [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6391.08s)]
*  They sing... [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6395.08s)]
*  The cutest get out, we're just awesome. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6396.08s)]
*  Do they sing in Japanese? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6398.08s)]
*  I thought it was a fan party. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6400.08s)]
*  What's the... [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6402.08s)]
*  Oh my god, how cute. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6404.08s)]
*  What's the Japanese happy birthday song? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6406.08s)]
*  Why did that come to you so quickly that you just made it up? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6409.08s)]
*  I don't know, I think... [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6413.08s)]
*  I'm going to look it up. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6416.08s)]
*  Japanese happy birthday song. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6417.08s)]
*  Osan, are you tired? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6425.08s)]
*  No. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6427.08s)]
*  Why are you saying that? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6429.08s)]
*  Do I look tired? [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6430.08s)]
*  You should have given me his tire. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6431.08s)]
*  No? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6433.08s)]
*  I know a tire. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6434.08s)]
*  Oh my god, somebody clocked me. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6435.08s)]
*  Because I've had a few birthdays at some Japanese restaurants. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6437.08s)]
*  And that's what they sang there. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6440.08s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6442.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6443.08s)]
*  Oh my god, he's not lying. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6445.08s)]
*  It's all in Japanese, but it's right though. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6446.08s)]
*  Because I used to go there every birthday and they changed it from the... [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6449.08s)]
*  It used to go... [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6453.08s)]
*  And I always requested the old birthday song, but they changed it to this one. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6457.08s)]
*  I've seen the old birthdays. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6461.08s)]
*  I don't know, yeah, but that's the new one. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6463.08s)]
*  So... [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6466.08s)]
*  I didn't know how... [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6467.08s)]
*  Did you have a loyalty rewards card? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6469.08s)]
*  No, no, never. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6471.08s)]
*  I wasn't old enough. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6472.08s)]
*  Last night he talked about how there's a Benihana here. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6473.08s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a Chinese restaurant here. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6475.08s)]
*  Oh. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6478.08s)]
*  It's not the actual Benihana. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6479.08s)]
*  Oh. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6480.08s)]
*  And for the record, I never wanted to go there even if there was one. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6482.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6486.08s)]
*  What's the... [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6487.08s)]
*  It's hibachi, but what is it called? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6489.08s)]
*  There's a different name for it here. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6491.08s)]
*  Like the actual style. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6493.08s)]
*  It's like a marsh. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6496.08s)]
*  Yeah, marsh. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6497.08s)]
*  These are the image people. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6499.08s)]
*  The answer is teppanyaki. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6500.08s)]
*  Oh, teppanyaki. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6501.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6502.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean... [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6504.08s)]
*  Flaming. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6507.08s)]
*  Okay, that was actually... [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6510.08s)]
*  You are in between your Japanese credits. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6511.08s)]
*  Me? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6515.08s)]
*  No, not you. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6516.08s)]

*  No, I didn't. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6521.08s)]
*  I'm actually shocked that you... [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6522.08s)]
*  I don't know the words, but... [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6523.08s)]
*  I'm still very impressed and shocked that you knew what it was. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=6525.08s)]

*  Thank you. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7476.08s)]
*  Are you doing [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7480.08s)]
*  the sign of the cross? Wait, where's the head? [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7482.08s)]
*  It's over there. Are you going to eat an eyeball? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7484.08s)]
*  Oh, I'm not eating the head. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7486.08s)]
*  You have to. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7488.08s)]
*  The cheek is this. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7490.08s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7492.08s)]
*  Bro, you killed it. I didn't see it. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7494.08s)]
*  Okay, listen up. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7496.08s)]
*  Everybody's in. Group rock, paper, scissors. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7498.08s)]
*  The what? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7500.08s)]
*  Loser eats the eyeballs. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7502.08s)]
*  I can't do it. I would vomit. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7504.08s)]
*  It would not be good. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7506.08s)]
*  It would not be... [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7508.08s)]
*  I could never. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7510.08s)]
*  I'm going to lose [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7512.08s)]
*  because I'm going to eat a fish eyeball. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7514.08s)]
*  I'm going to lose. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7516.08s)]
*  I'm going to eat it. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7518.08s)]
*  March, get in here. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7520.08s)]
*  If I'm doing it, you've got to do it too. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7522.08s)]
*  Can we do fingers instead? I can't, y'all. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7524.08s)]
*  Hold on. I can't. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7526.08s)]
*  Oh, even odds? I killed him. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7528.08s)]
*  No, fingers, which is when you... [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7530.08s)]
*  Everyone's just a finger and you go... [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7532.08s)]
*  For each one, you guess a finger. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7534.08s)]
*  So however many fingers there's five, you guess how many are left on the bank. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7536.08s)]
*  So you can either take your finger off or leave it on the bank. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7538.08s)]
*  Three, two, like... [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7540.08s)]
*  I should be out. I killed the fish. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7542.08s)]
*  Are our eyes closed? No. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7544.08s)]
*  So you can either go... [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7546.08s)]
*  Three, two, one, three. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7548.08s)]
*  That was my turn, but he went. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7550.08s)]
*  So you can leave your finger on or you take it off, [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7552.08s)]
*  but you have to three, two, one, [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7554.08s)]
*  and then make a decision. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7556.08s)]
*  You're in. I killed the fish. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7558.08s)]
*  You have a one in a hundred chance of losing. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7560.08s)]
*  I'm going to shoot you. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7562.08s)]
*  You have a one in a hundred chance. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7564.08s)]
*  Let's get this closer to Christian. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7566.08s)]
*  Can I add another finger? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7568.08s)]
*  No, you can't add another finger. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7570.08s)]
*  I don't know how it works. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7572.08s)]
*  So whoever's turn it is, we'll go three, two, one, and then they'll guess a number. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7574.08s)]
*  There's five fingers here, so I'll go three, two, one, three. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7578.08s)]
*  I was wrong. There's four. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7582.08s)]
*  So you can keep your finger on or you can take it off. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7584.08s)]
*  He doesn't know what you're going to do. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7586.08s)]
*  If you get the number right, you're out of the fish eye. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7588.08s)]
*  You're safe, basically. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7590.08s)]
*  I'm going to start with you to give you an extra chance. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7592.08s)]
*  So Austin, look, there's five fingers, so it can be zero or there can be one, two, three, four, five. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7594.08s)]
*  We're making content, baby. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7600.08s)]
*  Three, two, one, two. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7602.08s)]
*  You left your finger. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7604.08s)]
*  I jerked when it was three. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7606.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7608.08s)]
*  But wait to say your number until it's three, two, one, four. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7610.08s)]
*  I can't do this. I'm stressing. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7612.08s)]
*  I'm starting to sweat. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7614.08s)]
*  Three, two, one, zero. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7616.08s)]
*  Three, two, one, three. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7618.08s)]
*  Three, two, one, four. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7620.08s)]
*  Oh, you bitch. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7622.08s)]
*  You got off right at the last second. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7624.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7626.08s)]
*  Did I mean I'm safe? [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7628.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7630.08s)]
*  Gay rights. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7632.08s)]
*  Get your finger back on here. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7634.08s)]
*  All right, your turn. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7636.08s)]

*  Oh, I shouldn't have pulled back. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7644.08s)]
*  I'm going to take it off. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7646.08s)]

*  Oh, my God. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7712.08s)]
*  I'm actually gagging for you right now. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7714.08s)]
*  You want to know why I did that? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7716.08s)]
*  I knew you were going to pull because I always say zero. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7718.08s)]
*  I said zero multiple times. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7720.08s)]
*  And I knew if I said one, you were going to pull back. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7722.08s)]
*  Oh. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7728.08s)]
*  It's always will. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7730.08s)]
*  It's so funny because he suggested it. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7732.08s)]
*  You're going to have to eat both of them? [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7734.08s)]

*  Hold on, hold on. Let me go closer. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7744.08s)]
*  Okay, fair, fair, fair. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7746.08s)]
*  It's a quill. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7748.08s)]
*  Let me bring it closer to the camera. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7750.08s)]
*  Get the drum in the background. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7754.08s)]
*  Are you ready? [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7756.08s)]
*  I'm dropping. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7758.08s)]
*  Oh, it's so much tougher than I thought. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7762.08s)]
*  You know, it's good luck. It's good luck actually. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7766.08s)]
*  It's good luck to eat eyeballs. You will have some luck. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7768.08s)]
*  Beauty, beauty, beauty. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7772.08s)]
*  It's so much chewier. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7774.08s)]
*  Do you want to sit? Suck it, suck it down. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7776.08s)]
*  Suck it. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7778.08s)]
*  So good. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7780.08s)]
*  Want a little beer? [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7784.08s)]
*  There's a lot of parts in there. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7786.08s)]
*  Ew. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7788.08s)]
*  What does that even mean, eyeball? Who's to say? [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7790.08s)]
*  It's a taste. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7792.08s)]
*  Okay, the taste [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7796.08s)]
*  was not as bad as I thought. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7798.08s)]
*  The texture was wild. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=7800.08s)]

*  Right after this? [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8758.08s)]
*  Well I texted most of the girls. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8760.08s)]
*  I was like, what are you guys doing? [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8762.08s)]
*  And they're all shopping. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8764.08s)]

*  But I know... [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8776.08s)]
*  I was just like, I don't know how long this boxing gym thing is going to be. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8778.08s)]
*  We're going to go shopping right now. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8784.08s)]
*  Shopping now? [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8786.08s)]
*  We're going to go to the main boxing gym. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8788.08s)]
*  So not really shopping. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8790.08s)]
*  Are you wanting to do the boxing gym? [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8792.08s)]
*  I think Will wants me to hit him. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8794.08s)]
*  Will wants you to hit him? [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8796.08s)]
*  I think it would be good for me to be there and box. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8798.08s)]
*  And hit him. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8800.08s)]
*  Is shopping a way? [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8802.08s)]
*  Is it a stream that you're going to? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8804.08s)]
*  No. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8806.08s)]
*  I don't think there's streaming. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8808.08s)]
*  They're mainly vlogging and eating. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8810.08s)]
*  So if you wanted to come with me I might end up doing that. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8812.08s)]
*  I'll probably go do me, me, outfit and then... [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8816.08s)]
*  I know. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8824.08s)]
*  You don't want a chance to hit Will. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8826.08s)]
*  I fear I'm not dressed to hit Will. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8832.08s)]
*  I fear I'm not dressed to punch him. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8834.08s)]
*  No, are you kidding me? [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8836.08s)]
*  The outfit is fabulous. Fabulous for getting in a fight. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=8838.08s)]

*  We can try the maid outfits [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9744.08s)]
*  but we can also [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9746.08s)]
*  in the process get me at least like [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9748.08s)]
*  different shoes or something. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9750.08s)]

*  No, because yeah, I have these on. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9754.08s)]

*  Okay. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9764.08s)]
*  So, we're going to... [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9766.08s)]
*  Where would we get the maid outfits? [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9768.08s)]
*  Harajuku. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9770.08s)]

*  Is it far from here? [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9778.08s)]
*  No, Harajuku is like a 15 minute walk. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9780.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwepwZN22XM&t=9782.08s)]
