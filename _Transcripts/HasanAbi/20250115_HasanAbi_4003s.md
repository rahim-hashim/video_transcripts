# Did Trump Or Biden Make The Ceasefire Happen? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc)
*  This level of Copium is so funny because like it's so far removed from the reality saying that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden actually had a lot of daylight between him and Israel is hilarious. While also simultaneously [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  trying to give Trump credit for the ceasefire, but also like recognizing that it's bad because [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=10.96s)]
*  for him it's bad. Right now I've been trying so hard not to cough and there was still [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=18.96s)]
*  hella people complaining about me clearing my throat. Okay. You guys lock in. Okay. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=29.04s)]
*  Eyes on the prize, man, for once. Hold on. I have to sneeze as well, but you heard, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=35.36s)]
*  don't be so down on yourself. Anyway. Where was I kind of breaking news on tick tock? Yeah. We're [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=43.12s)]
*  going to talk about that as well. Is there a quality or are you sick? I think it's a bit of both. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=49.04s)]
*  It's like the air quality index keeps saying that the air is safe to inhale, but I don't know if [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=53.04s)]
*  that's the case because maybe there's just like too many particulates in the air or something. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=59.36s)]
*  Even if the air quality index is saying and save it, maybe it may not be, but you know, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=64.96s)]
*  Dave isn't necessarily good, bro. No, they're saying it's good, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=71.92s)]
*  not safe. Like the air quality index reports that it's good. So anyway, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=75.28s)]
*  um, but that is yes. I, like, I didn't, I didn't come up with the idea of potentially going in. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=80.8s)]
*  Okay. I was approached with the idea of potentially going in from people that have worked inside of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Gaza and still continue to, um, still continue to do great journalism, which is why I'm, you know, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=94.8s)]
*  thinking about it. As long as it's something that I can do in a safe manner. Obviously it's not, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=103.6s)]
*  you know, obviously it's just in the works right now. That's all it is. That's all I'm stating. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=108.8s)]
*  I'm not saying that it's going to 100% happen. Um, and I don't, yeah, the key word here is if [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=114.24s)]
*  it's safe. Now, having said that, having said that, I, for example, I don't know if me process would [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  make me a larger target or potentially offer me a shield. Uh, you know, that's the, that's the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  other thing that I don't know. I also don't know who I could bring with me. You know what I mean? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=132.4s)]
*  I don't know if I could actually get March to, to put his life on the line as well. He makes too [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=136.56s)]
*  far too much money as my producer is a co-owner and a co-operator of the, uh, of the co-op. Uh, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=141.84s)]
*  I doubt that he is gonna, March is throwing question marks up. See, this is what I'm saying. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=148.48s)]
*  March, would you go into Gaza? I'm just saying if we had the opportunity. Oh, he said he'd go. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=154.16s)]
*  All right. Perfect. Okay. Nevermind. March is down. You had chatters in here earlier, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=159.04s)]
*  giving you a shift for giving credit to Trump and an award winning journalist. She said the same [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=163.04s)]
*  thing. Almost like people should listen. Yeah. They, uh, those people don't care. It's not even [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=165.84s)]
*  giving credit to Trump. It's just accurately reporting on the truth of what took place. Okay. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=171.04s)]
*  I will never forgive nor forget Joseph Robinette Biden. Okay. I will never forgive nor forget [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=178.4s)]
*  for so many different reasons, but the very fact that like he had this opportunity and he did [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=186.4s)]
*  nothing. He had this opportunity and he did nothing with all the power that he had, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=191.84s)]
*  all the influence that he had. The fact that he also let Trump take credit for this because Trump [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=195.6s)]
*  applied pressure in the last moment. I mean, it's just crazy. Just a terrible, terrible psychopath, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=202.08s)]
*  terrible sociopath who enjoyed the killing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=209.68s)]
*  I want to ask you just real quickly, uh, ambassador, if you could understand any of what was being said [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=221.84s)]
*  and if, if you think that what you think this is now that you can hear some of it. Oh God. Oh my [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=230.08s)]
*  God. Come on. You know, I'm not sure, but again, you know, no, he can't understand what's being said [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=235.36s)]
*  and he already lied about what's being said. Anyway, this person does not care about Palestinians. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=240.56s)]
*  He literally said they're all supporting Hamas. Their only source of information is what Hamas [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=245.44s)]
*  tells them. So maybe they're being told by Hamas because, you know, again, this, this is going to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=250.96s)]
*  end up being a defeat for Hamas. It may take six weeks. It may take, may take another year, you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=256.64s)]
*  know, before it's all cleaned up, but this will end up in a defeat for Hamas. Maybe the Hamas is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  spinning this to their people that somehow, you know, they're getting, they're going to remain in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=266.24s)]
*  power and maybe that's the, maybe that's their narrative, but it's not, it's going to be short-lived. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=270.56s)]
*  Uh, my, my colleague Charles Payne is here with a question for you ambassador. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=275.76s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you very much. The Biden administration initially gave so many, uh, mixed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=280.4s)]
*  signals on this that in many ways I felt, at least as an outside observer, it emboldened Hamas. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  We know President Trump will not do that. Will there be a way, you know, Santos and, and, and, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=293.52s)]
*  and talks about an avenue for your adversaries to retreat? What kind of efforts are being made, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=298.88s)]
*  if you can talk about it, to at least find sensible people in Gaza that understand that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  the path they're on now means total destruction and that if they do want to rise up, because there [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=308.56s)]
*  has to be a lot of dissatisfied people there, they will get some help from Israel and perhaps [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=315.04s)]
*  the United States so that they can take control of their nation. And it's not Hamas who's the, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=320.48s)]
*  once again, leading them down this path to destruction where they put hospitals, babies, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=325.68s)]
*  and everything else in a line of, in the line of danger. Well, well, Charles, it begins with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=330.8s)]
*  the eradication of Hamas. As long as Hamas is there, it's absolutely impossible for anybody [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=335.28s)]
*  to rise up who will put the interests of, of his people and his children ahead of the grievances [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=340.96s)]
*  of the F***er Israel. So as long as Hamas is there, it's, it's, it's virtually impossible. But [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=347.52s)]
*  the key point here, as you talked about the difference between Biden and Trump, the key word [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=352.96s)]
*  is daylight. You know, there was massive daylight between Biden and Israel over the last 15 months. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=357.2s)]
*  And every time Hamas saw that daylight and empowered them and made them think that they can [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=362.48s)]
*  hang in. This level of copium is so funny because like it's so far removed from the reality [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=366.88s)]
*  saying that Biden actually had a lot of daylight between him and Israel is hilarious. While also [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=372.24s)]
*  simultaneously trying to give Trump credit for the ceasefire, but also like recognizing that it's bad [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=377.36s)]
*  because for him, it's bad. David Freeman doesn't like the ceasefire by his own metric. If there's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=385.76s)]
*  daylight between Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu, not only is it not, it's just funny. Cause if there's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=390.88s)]
*  daylight between Biden and Netanyahu, what is there? There is a supernova between Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=397.52s)]
*  and Donald Trump at this point. After all, he's the one who pressured after all, he was the one [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=403.84s)]
*  who pressured Benjamin Netanyahu to, to follow through on this deal. That's crazy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=409.52s)]
*  And there that they could potentially emerge victorious and in control. The loss of life [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=413.68s)]
*  was meaningless to them. That's part of their battle strategy. So they didn't care about that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=419.2s)]
*  Trump comes in and the daylights completely shut, right? It's shut by his words. It's shut by the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=424.0s)]
*  words of his team. And that's the first step that the coalition between Israel, the rock [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=428.96s)]
*  solid hand in hand, no daylight relationship between Israel and America is what gets this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=435.76s)]
*  started. At least the eradication of Hamas, but it's, but it's not, there's no. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  It's so funny to actively lie to the Fox news watchers like this. Yeah. No, Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=446.08s)]
*  who loves the ceasefire, he's the biggest fan of the ceasefire there. And I'm sure the president's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=452.16s)]
*  going to want to continue to engage with all of you in the next couple of days. Okay. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=457.92s)]
*  Thank you. Good to see you. And thank you so much for taking our questions so often. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=461.2s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks. So in terms of implementing the terms of this agreement, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=467.04s)]
*  how confident is president Biden that the incoming administration will do that? And have they offered [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  any assurances that they will carry them out? I think, look, I think there's a commitment to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=479.44s)]
*  move forward with this deal. I think there's a commitment to make sure that there's an end [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=484.8s)]
*  to this war. Obviously, hostages are going to be coming home. Obviously, we've been in very close [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=491.2s)]
*  touch with the Trump transition. And the president was asked some variation of that question moments [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=496.08s)]
*  ago when he, after he spoke and he said he is very much indeed confident. So look, we are, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=502.08s)]
*  we understand this is going to be implemented by the next team. As I just stated, we are going to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  work closely in close coordination with the Trump team. As the president has said, and I have said [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=513.6s)]
*  also moments ago, we want this to be in one voice, right? I think that's what you have seen [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=520.8s)]
*  in the past couple of weeks, how we have moved forward in one voice. And this is what's important [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=525.44s)]
*  for the hostages to get them home, to make sure that we're getting that humanitarian aid into [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=531.6s)]
*  Gaza and to ending this war, ending this war that has taken a lot of innocent lives. And so that is [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=536.24s)]
*  the commitment. That is the commitment that you, that you can see from us. I hate the Democrats so [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=542.96s)]
*  much. I truly believe that. Thank you. Thank you, Kareem. You and the president have stressed that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  I despise them so much. Like they're so bad. Like they're just as monstrous as the Republican [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=555.36s)]
*  party is on this issue. Okay. Maybe not on every other issue, but specifically on this issue. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=563.04s)]
*  They're just as monstrous. Okay. And maybe even today the Republicans have outflanked them, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  but they're also so smarmy, so elitist, so annoying. Like they're so weak and silly [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=575.44s)]
*  with the way that they just try to hold on to this notion of like international rule-based [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=586.88s)]
*  order that they actually abided by when like no one believes them. This is a generational [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=593.76s)]
*  L for the Democrats, a generational L, especially when paired up with Donald Trump. If he actually [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=599.76s)]
*  saves TikTok, which I think he will, maybe I'm wrong, but God damn dude, like the Trump train [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  is coming and he's going to use all of that newfound confidence in him and all of the good promo [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=615.76s)]
*  to basically laser every Mexican on US soil. And the Democrats are going to cheer it on to be like, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=622.88s)]
*  you deserve this. Like just no recognition of their own failures, no recognition of the role [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=630.4s)]
*  they played in this j***** side and continuing it. Nothing. Disgusting, dude. This is the framework [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  that he put forward last spring, but the president also made clear it was important to him to work [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  with the incoming administration that they be speaking in one, as one team, as he put it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  Even the Qatari prime minister in his remarks personally thanked Steve Wittkopf, the incoming [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=651.12s)]
*  administration's Middle East envoy. So do Donald Trump and his team deserve any credit for this? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=655.92s)]
*  I mean, look, everyone is going to want some credit. Everybody's going to want some credit. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=661.12s)]
*  Get that? That's how this goes when something good happens. Not unusual. It is not unusual at all. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=665.84s)]
*  What I can say is the president got it done. Why are you acting like this is not going to [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=672.16s)]
*  get reversed in like a week and then Trump is going to claim that he's bombing the Palestinians [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=676.56s)]
*  for national security or whatever? First of all, I'm not even saying that that might not happen. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=681.52s)]
*  I'm saying that there is a high likelihood that that will happen. Okay. But what's the, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=686.88s)]
*  who will fight against that when that happens? You understand? Who? Will it be the Democrats? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=691.3599999999999s)]
*  The Democrats didn't even get the ceasefire. Do you not understand? That's the problem. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=698.4s)]
*  The Democrats did not fire. That's what is endlessly frustrating to me, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=703.84s)]
*  is that the Democrats got outflanked by a guy who is the absolute worst. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  Right. That's what I can say. And what I could also say is that, and you said it in your question [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=714.64s)]
*  to me, is that there was a framework that was put forward and it was put forward by the president [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=722.0s)]
*  back in May, May 31st of last year. And it was endorsed by the world. And you see a president [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=726.4s)]
*  that has done everything that he can. This is someone who has foreign policy experience, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=733.12s)]
*  decades of foreign policy experience. He understands what it means to bring people to [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=738.8s)]
*  grows, grow up. No one cares. No one believes this [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=742.88s)]
*  together. He understands what it means to get a deal done. He also said in his remarks, how [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=749.68s)]
*  difficult it was to negotiate. Negotiating is incredibly hard and this wasn't easy, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=755.2s)]
*  but we got it done. And so, this is someone who speaks from experience. And this is again, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=761.36s)]
*  not an easy thing to get done. But as we've said, and I've said multiple. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=772.72s)]
*  There was an Arab envoy that said, according to reports, there was an Arab envoy that said, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=778.88s)]
*  Trump did with Witkoff in one week, what Democrats didn't do for 15 months. Even if you're not super [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=783.44s)]
*  primed and super tuned into every single thing that's going on and aware of the minutiae, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=789.92s)]
*  okay. Even if you're not aware of that, what you are aware of is grander things that are happening [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  in the world. Trump is about to be president. Trump has said, get the ceasefire done before I [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  become president. It's true. He has said those things. And for the past 15 months, you're aware [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=805.92s)]
*  that no ceasefire happened as Joe Biden kept saying, we're working tirelessly around the clock to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=810.88s)]
*  implement a ceasefire. So what are people supposed to have as a takeaway from this? What are people [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=815.44s)]
*  supposed to look at here and go, Oh, well, you guys don't understand the complex nature of these [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=820.72s)]
*  dealings because no matter what happens, like Donald Trump, even if it was a Democrats that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=826.0s)]
*  finally were able to push that button to get Netanyahu to concede five days before Biden came [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=831.7600000000001s)]
*  out of office. Okay. Even if that was the case, good luck explaining that to Americans who are [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=837.9200000000001s)]
*  like, well, why didn't we do that for 15 months? Isn't it because Netanyahu wants to make Trump [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=844.32s)]
*  look good? That's why he didn't want to make a deal with Biden because it would help them. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=848.6400000000001s)]
*  Dude, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, a responsible elder statesman should be aware [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=852.08s)]
*  of what is happening in front of his eyes. He holds all the cards. He had full control [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=860.1600000000001s)]
*  over the situation. That's it. Here's times of Israel's reporting on it. Times of Israel's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=865.36s)]
*  reporting Arab officials, Trump envoy, swayed Netanyahu more in one meeting than Biden did all [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=870.8s)]
*  year. I think liberals are going to get way grosser by the way, for the record, they're going to say, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=875.68s)]
*  they're going to turn around and say, well, guess what? The, the genocide is still imminent to all [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=881.52s)]
*  the Muslims who are now celebrating all the Muslim Americans and Muslims all around the world that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=887.68s)]
*  are celebrating a potential ceasefire. They're going to turn around and be like, I hope Netanyahu [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  kills your entire family as well here in America. Times. And I think Jake Sullivan said this [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=896.64s)]
*  obviously recently when he was here on Monday, we were able to work closely with the Trump [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=901.52s)]
*  transition team. Look at this stupid fucking dumbass absolute moron who is a Trump supporter. It [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=908.72s)]
*  seems. Are you not happy that there's a ceasefire now? Would you not prefer the horrible war to [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=916.64s)]
*  continue? Would you prefer the horrible war to continue? Did I not say that I'm happy that [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=920.4s)]
*  there's a ceasefire and even gave Trump the credit that everyone has been yelling at me for? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=924.32s)]
*  Maybe your dumb European mind cannot comprehend the English language well enough. And you just [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  simply can't understand the words that are coming out of my fucking mouth. Stupid fuck. Wow. It sure [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=933.6s)]
*  seems like your hatred over Trump is actually overcoming your accurate assessment here. It [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=939.44s)]
*  seems like you want the war to continue. Dumbass. And coordinate with them. But again, this is a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=944.72s)]
*  framework that the president put out and negotiations aren't easy. And this is one of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=951.68s)]
*  the toughest negotiations that that he experienced. And this is something that the president shared [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=955.5999999999999s)]
*  with all of you October the seventh, more than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=960.88s)]
*  the Israeli people, more than 15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=968.2399999999999s)]
*  fighting in Gaza will stop. And soon the hostage will return home to their families. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=975.28s)]
*  The elements of this deal are what I laid out in detail this past May, which was embraced by [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=980.96s)]
*  countries around the world and endorsed overwhelmingly by the UN Security Council. The [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=987.12s)]
*  deal is structured in three phases. Phase one will last six weeks. It includes a full and [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=993.52s)]
*  complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women and elderly and the wounded. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1007.12s)]
*  And I'm proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release and phase one as well. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1015.52s)]
*  And the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home. In exchange, Israel released [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1019.68s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. And during phase one, the Palestinians can also return to [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1025.44s)]
*  their neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza. And the surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza will [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1030.96s)]
*  begin. And the innocent people can have greater access to these vital supplies. You know, during [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  the next six weeks, Israel will negotiate the necessary arrangements to get phase two, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1043.6000000000001s)]
*  which is a permanent end of the war. Let me say it again, a permanent end of the war. There are [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1050.4s)]
*  a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two. But the plan says if [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1055.44s)]
*  negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire will continue as long as the negotiations [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1062.96s)]
*  continue. I've spoken to the mayor of Kuwait and the president of Egypt, and we have pledged to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1070.0s)]
*  make sure the negotiations will keep moving forward for as long as it takes. Then, when phase two [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1076.64s)]
*  begins, remember signature moment starts off by talking about how Hezbollah did October 7, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1083.6s)]
*  literally right there says the president of Kuwait played a role in this. When he should have said [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  cutter, like I'm supposed to expect that this guy actually played a role here. Really? Really? He [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  don't even know where he is right now. He's straight up dooking in his diapers at this very [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1101.12s)]
*  moment. And like liberal media is trying to be like, look, he did it again. He done did it again. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1106.48s)]
*  My goat, my goat, Brandon, he's just that good. We'll be in exchange for release of the remaining. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1112.72s)]
*  I just want to remind everyone that Biden was supposed to re-instill confidence in American [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  leadership at the global stage. That was one of the signature moments. Like that was the thing [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1126.56s)]
*  that he was better on Trump on. Look at, look at us now. That's unironically what he ran on. Remember [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  he ran on normalcy. He ran on restoring America's confidence, America's soft power capabilities that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1138.56s)]
*  Trump had diminished. And it was, in my opinion, the worst failure of his administration. It was [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1145.2s)]
*  precisely that in which he failed so spectacularly at. But it's crazy. There is not one area where [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1153.44s)]
*  he actually has done something that helped America's placement as the leader of this [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1160.96s)]
*  empire. What do I, like even NATO, right? NATO, I did NATO. You know who did NATO? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1170.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. Even that was a gift from Vladimir Putin to Biden. And even that had tremendous [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1177.1200000000001s)]
*  amounts of failures associated with it. Because on the one hand he was like, I did NATO. On the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1183.76s)]
*  other hand, it probably accelerated the fascist parties in Europe with the destabilization that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1190.0s)]
*  took place. So literally, even on that front, the NATO side of the conversation is straight up [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1194.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's psychopathic ambitions in Russia or in Ukraine. And the failure, the spectacular [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1203.68s)]
*  failure that his invasion of Ukraine turned into so that it was both enough proof for Finland and [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1211.68s)]
*  Sweden to join NATO, like enough reason for them to want to join NATO, while simultaneously [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1221.28s)]
*  recognizing that they're too busy to do anything about Finland or Sweden. So it grew NATO is true. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  Ironically enough, though, it grew NATO because of Vladimir Putin's ineptitude and incompetence and [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  bloodlust. So even that was a gift if that was even to be considered a gift, even the positive [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1241.52s)]
*  from the perspective of the democratic establishment, even the, the, the one crumb that [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1247.68s)]
*  is supposedly positive for, for Joe Biden was that he did NATO and even he didn't do NATO. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1253.84s)]
*  It's crazy. The end and use my interview with Bernie on air. Let's go. Is the goat doing actual [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1260.08s)]
*  interviews? Is your content is your favorite Twitch streamer actually doing real news reporting? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1266.72s)]
*  See now to see says these three leave office with their, with their standing in tatters at home [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1272.0s)]
*  and in the world. Once seen as the best hope for the liberal global order in the face of Trumpism, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1277.04s)]
*  they have failed in such spectacular ways. The history is bound to neither forget nor forgive. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Accidentally did a journalism. No, it's not an accident. Interviews such as that one high [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1285.92s)]
*  profile in every such as that one also is journalism. Just like doing on the ground [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1291.6s)]
*  reporting on like issues that are otherwise on a tre, an address would be also considered [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1296.9599999999998s)]
*  real reporting when you're bringing forth from your interview subject, a new piece of information [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1302.08s)]
*  that they haven't revealed before that would be real reporting, living hostages, including male [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1307.28s)]
*  soldiers and all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza and the temporary ceasefire [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1311.6s)]
*  will become permanent. And finally, phase three, any final remains of hostages who have been killed [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1319.12s)]
*  will be returned to their families and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin this. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1326.6399999999999s)]
*  This is the ceasefire agreements I introduced last spring. Today Hamas and Israel have agreed [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1332.56s)]
*  to that ceasefire agreement and the whole ending the war. You know, those of you who have followed [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1340.2399999999998s)]
*  the negotiations can attest the road to this deal has not been easy. I've worked in foreign [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1346.0s)]
*  policy for decades. This is one of the tough. It's just crazy because like Trump did it in a week. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1352.0s)]
*  I'm just not going to ever forgive or forget. I will also warn you. Trump is not a friend of [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1358.32s)]
*  the Palestinians. The man who is the staunchest ally of Israel was able to conduct these affairs [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1365.28s)]
*  in less than a week by sending an envoy that has no business being there. Okay. Disrespecting the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1370.96s)]
*  Israeli side through and through Israel, once again, showing the world that they only respond [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1377.04s)]
*  to pressure. They only respond to being bullied. And for some weird reason, Democrats never [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1382.56s)]
*  understood that. And I think that it's not because they didn't understand it. It's not because they're [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1387.3600000000001s)]
*  like feckless cowards or whatever, which they are. But I think it's also because they liked it. They [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1393.1200000000001s)]
*  liked what Israel was doing. They were on board with it. They were in favor of it. They liked it. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1398.4s)]
*  They wanted more of it. How else could you look at the situation and go, you know, it's okay to [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1402.48s)]
*  give $8 billion of weapons merely a week ago to Israel? To consistently talk about how difficult [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1409.2800000000002s)]
*  of a process this is in the wake of Donald Trump's introduction to the process, yielding the first [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1416.96s)]
*  successful position since the beginning of the conflict is really stupid. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1424.16s)]
*  Trump's negotiations I've ever experienced have reached this point because of the pressure [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1429.44s)]
*  that Israel built on Amos, backed by the United States. Or maybe the pressure that Trump instilled [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1436.64s)]
*  on Israel. Amos's strongest supporter, Iran, launched attacks on Israel. Those attacks failed [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1443.68s)]
*  after my administration organized the coalition of nations to stop them. And after I ordered the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1450.16s)]
*  U.S. ships and planes to come to Israel's defense, we also shaped Israel's strong and calibrated [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1455.3600000000001s)]
*  response, destroying Iran's air defenses, but avoiding an eschatory cycle of an all-out war. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1460.88s)]
*  The United States also organized a coalition of 20 countries to stand up to attacks by the Houthis, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1469.44s)]
*  including the missiles. Dan Hezboah. Bro, L after L after L. He's just posterizing his L's, dude. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1475.76s)]
*  It is freaking hilarious. It is objectively hilarious that he just, every aspect of this, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1485.28s)]
*  every everything that he's mentioned so far is just an L plus another L plus another L. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1493.12s)]
*  Another of Amos's strongest backers was significantly weakened on the battlefield. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1498.7199999999998s)]
*  And its leadership was destroyed with our support, negotiated a ceasefire with them, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1504.48s)]
*  and after that, Lebanon finally elected a new president who's not, who's not beholding Hezboah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1510.24s)]
*  And he can begin a new chapter for the Lebanese people. All told, that's right, he's a Maronite [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1517.3600000000001s)]
*  Christian, Jack. Totally unique and new to the Lebanese constitution. Oh wait, I'm being told [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1523.92s)]
*  that that's how it works in perpetuity in Lebanese history. Nevermind that this one's a cool [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1529.84s)]
*  Maronite Christian rather than the last one. This is the region which the United States helped to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1536.08s)]
*  shape change. For those of you who don't know, that's like how it goes in Lebanon because they [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1541.28s)]
*  have like multiple different, fairly significant religious populations. So in an effort to create [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1545.6799999999998s)]
*  some semblance of like equality and parity, the president is supposed to be from like one sect. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1554.16s)]
*  It's a silly, it's a silly requirement within the government. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1561.92s)]
*  ...the equation. And so now the terror network that once protected and sustained Amos [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1565.3600000000001s)]
*  is far weaker. Iran is weaker. Iran is weaker than it's been in decades. Hezboah is badly degraded. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1571.2s)]
*  And after more than 15 months of war, Amos' senior leaders are dead. Thousands of Amos [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1579.8400000000001s)]
*  fighters are dead and the military formations have been destroyed. The guy behind him literally [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1586.4s)]
*  undermined this statement yesterday. The guy behind him was like, Amos has actually restored [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1592.4s)]
*  its numbers to pre-October 7 levels like according to our reports. Nowhere to turn, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1597.3600000000001s)]
*  Amos finally agreed to releasing hostages. You know, there was no other way for this war to end [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  than with a hostage deal. And I'm deeply satisfied. This day has come, finally come, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1612.0s)]
*  for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony and for the sake of [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1618.4s)]
*  the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1624.32s)]
*  The Palestinian people have gone through hell. Too many innocent people have died. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1630.1599999999999s)]
*  Too many communities have been destroyed. And this deal, the people of Gaza can finally recover [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1635.6s)]
*  and rebuild. They can look to a future without Hamas in power. You know, the Bible says, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1641.6s)]
*  blessed are the peacemakers. Many peacemakers helped make this deal happen, including an [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1647.04s)]
*  extraordinary team of American diplomats who have worked nonstop for months to get this done. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1653.04s)]
*  Secretary Blinken led the effort. Secretary Jake Sullivan, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1660.08s)]
*  NASA security advisor Jake Sullivan, Bill Burns, John Finer, Brett McGurk, Amos Hoxton. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1665.1999999999998s)]
*  Bro, bro's naming all the war criminals that need to go and face a military tribunal, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1671.6799999999998s)]
*  Nuremberg style. Amos Hoxton, Brett McGurk. They did a fantastic job for months. Yeah, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  fantastic for Israel, honestly, in terms of like being permanently committed to Israel's genocide. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1683.68s)]
*  Yeah, they did. They played a spectacular role in the Israel-Palestine conflict, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1690.3200000000002s)]
*  if you want to call it that. Just on the side of Israel. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1695.92s)]
*  The vice president worked relentlessly as we worked to deliver this deal. I'd also note [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1698.8s)]
*  this deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  for the most part by the next administration. In these past few days, we've been speaking as [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1711.92s)]
*  one team. This has been time of real turmoil in the Middle East, but as I prepare to leave office, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1718.3200000000002s)]
*  our friends are strong, our enemies are weak, and there's genuine opportunities for a new future. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1725.1200000000001s)]
*  In Lebanon, there's an opportunity for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah. In Syria, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1732.0800000000002s)]
*  a future free from the tyranny of Assad. And for the Palestinian people, a credible, credible pathway [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1739.2s)]
*  to a state of their own. And for the region, a future of normalization, integration of Israel [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1745.3600000000001s)]
*  and all its Arab neighbors, including Saudi Arabia. At the G20 in Delhi in September 23, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1752.48s)]
*  I rallied key countries behind the vision of an economic corridor from India across the Middle [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1759.52s)]
*  East to Europe. That vision can now become a reality. There are risks as well, including ISIS [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1764.72s)]
*  and Iran, even in a badly weakened state. But, but we're handing off to the next team a real [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1770.64s)]
*  opportunity for a better future for the Middle East. I hope they will take it. Let me close with [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1777.68s)]
*  this. My friend for years in the United States Senate, former Senator George Mitchell, who did [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1783.76s)]
*  so much to forge peace in Northern Ireland once said about diplomacy, he said, it is a 700 days [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1789.6s)]
*  of failure and one day success. 700 days of failure and one day success. Well, we've had many difficult [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1795.1999999999998s)]
*  days since the mosque began this terrible war. We've encountered roadblocks and setbacks. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1803.4399999999998s)]
*  We've not given up. And now after more than 400 days of struggle, a day of success is arrived. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1809.1999999999998s)]
*  I still think he's going to die in 2025 of old age. Okay. For the secret service, I'm saying this [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1816.4s)]
*  is speculation. Okay. I'm, I'm, it is legally allowed to make this speculation. He's very old. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1821.2800000000002s)]
*  He's 900 years old. Okay. It's not, it's not even like an out there assessment. Okay. It is pretty [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  funny that this man, like people tried to tell us that this man was going to do four more years, dude. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1835.76s)]
*  All right. God bless all the hostages and the families. May God protect the troops of all those [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1841.6000000000001s)]
*  who work for peace. The implementation of this deal will be in the hands of the next administration. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1847.52s)]
*  And basically they will shape the future of Gaza. So how do you see this future? And also, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1855.68s)]
*  how much credit do you give to the Trump team for this deal? Trump is already taking credit for it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1861.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, this is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1866.8s)]
*  Exactly. Hey, dumbass. Everybody understands that. But there was one party that refused to [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1871.6s)]
*  negotiate with you and it surely wasn't Hamas. Even though you kept saying it was Hamas [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1878.72s)]
*  over and over and over again, ironically enough, the proposal was Hamas's proposal, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1885.84s)]
*  which you said was Israel's proposal. And then for some weird reason, Israel never [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1890.56s)]
*  agreed to the proposal. And virtually everyone that's on the state department, the state department [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1895.76s)]
*  beep, aside from the people that I've had on this broadcast kept covering it as though it was [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1902.32s)]
*  factually accurate. Whenever Anthony Blinken said Hamas is a real hurdle in the pathway to, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1908.24s)]
*  to clearing out this proposal. And now there's just no room to hide. You know what I mean? Like, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1914.72s)]
*  how do you continue this narrative now in this day and age in this moment? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1919.84s)]
*  What is this? I'm going to pile on like this in the Trump, you know, why the left lose every time [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1924.48s)]
*  we don't line up behind our side, like the right does our inviting is our undoing. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1928.9599999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden has never been on my side. No one who does genocide is on my side. You are not a part [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1933.6799999999998s)]
*  of the left. You are not even a liberal. If you're a pro genocide. Okay. What side, I don't want to [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1938.8s)]
*  be on your side. You are not on my side. You are barely a human being. If you, if you look at this [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1943.92s)]
*  conversation through partisan lines, I can't make this clear enough for you. Joe Biden is a genocide [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1950.3200000000002s)]
*  air, a weak little old man who took great pleasure in the death and destruction of Palestinian [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1956.16s)]
*  children in the scholastic side that took place in the genocide that took place under his watchful [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1962.5600000000002s)]
*  eye as he gleefully sent billions of dollars of weapons over and over again, stepping preexisting [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1967.68s)]
*  law like the Leahy law that made it illegal to send Israel weapons at a time when they were very [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1974.64s)]
*  clearly violating international humanitarian law. So clearly violating it that as a matter of fact, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1980.0s)]
*  the state department, USAID, for example, openly tried to send this assessment to the other [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1987.1200000000001s)]
*  vampire that's standing right behind him, Anthony Blinken and Anthony Blinken openly stated that he [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1994.32s)]
*  did not care about the real assessments of Israel's clear cut violations of international humanitarian [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=1999.1999999999998s)]
*  law. It's additionally ironic that they lied to the very end as the exclusive reporting [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2006.24s)]
*  that Jeremy Scahill showed on the broadcast that they lied until yesterday. Anthony Blinken lied [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2018.56s)]
*  until yesterday, protecting Israel, claiming that it was still Hamas that was a bottleneck [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2026.88s)]
*  to the ceasefire when they already had had the Palestinian envoy's signatures in their hands [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2032.08s)]
*  since Monday. Think about that. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2039.84s)]
*  But of course, part of the reason why they can lie so actively, so openly, so brazenly [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2048.48s)]
*  is because the media, it comes hand in hand. Like many outlets will do their bidding, do the bidding [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2063.52s)]
*  at the state department unflinchingly and will reaffirm the silly ideas that you can immediately [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2071.44s)]
*  contradict with your own two eyes and like a little bit of critical thinking. It doesn't require much [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2079.92s)]
*  intellect to understand that something doesn't make sense. But Israel killed the principal [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2084.8s)]
*  negotiator on the ceasefire and the hostage negotiation, man. Israel assassinated Ismail Haniye [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2090.56s)]
*  in Tehran. You don't do that when you're, you know, genuinely tirelessly working to do a ceasefire. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2098.3199999999997s)]
*  And we got the world to endorse it. Secondly, it's America's support for Israel that helped them [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2107.52s)]
*  badly weaken Hamas and its backers and create the conditions for this deal. And thirdly, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2117.2799999999997s)]
*  I knew this deal would have to be implemented by the next team, so I told my team to coordinate [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2125.52s)]
*  closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2132.08s)]
*  because that's what American presidents do. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2138.16s)]
*  Thank you. How many Americans will be released when the hostages are being released? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2142.3199999999997s)]
*  All the exact detail of how many people are being held, how many bodies will be returned, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2150.0s)]
*  and less will all be forthcoming. All of it. Oh, thank you. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2155.44s)]
*  I'm confident. Thank you. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2163.6s)]
*  Is that a joke? Oh, yeah, it's not a joke. We all know the truth, man. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2170.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I put that question to the... God damn, that was loud. I apologize, chat. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2175.8399999999997s)]
*  ... your prime minister, because the real sense here on the ground is that the last month has been [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2180.48s)]
*  really quite crucial because of the pressure that the Trump administration and the envoy [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2186.64s)]
*  of Donald Trump has put on all sides. You really do get that... [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2191.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, cat's out of the bag, man. Good luck. Good luck to the Western press. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2196.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, good luck to American liberals who are going to try to like, good luck to Reddit, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2200.64s)]
*  really not even like liberal media, but I think good luck to Reddit. Those are the guys, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2206.64s)]
*  Reddit liberals who are Natsang liberals are going to be killing themselves openly [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2210.96s)]
*  and publicly committing suicide after actively one pushing for more dead Palestinian children. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2215.7599999999998s)]
*  And also to, uh, trying to get Biden to take credit for this thing that virtually no one [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2223.44s)]
*  will believe them on. So many Reddit liberals are going to openly commit suicide, I think, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2229.36s)]
*  in Minecraft. In a video game, of course. How will they contend with the reality? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2234.96s)]
*  It's so hard. They'll just, I mean, look, I'm sure they'll just stick around for a little bit and [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2245.84s)]
*  wait for Trump to also open up the unlimited genocide faucet, you know, so they can turn around [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2251.6800000000003s)]
*  and be like, you deserve this. You know, you deserve this, sand people, that type of attitude, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2257.36s)]
*  I'm sure. Since, because when you look at the deal, it's not very different from the deal that the [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2264.88s)]
*  Biden administration has been pushing from about May of last year. It's almost identical to the [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2270.32s)]
*  May deal that Biden announced here at the White House all those months ago. So it's one of the [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2278.7200000000003s)]
*  key questions. I guess there are three key questions right now. The first is, can the deal, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2285.68s)]
*  the ceasefire hold? The second is, will it bring a lasting peace? And the third question is, as you [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2290.7999999999997s)]
*  put to the Qatari prime minister, why now? I think there are a number of reasons. First of all, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2296.96s)]
*  the situation on the ground in the region has changed quite. Are you aware that people on the [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2302.8799999999997s)]
*  right don't want the ceasefire? They want all Palestinians gone? Yeah. Are you aware that people [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2307.9199999999996s)]
*  on the left also, well not left, but liberals also want that very same thing? Are you also doubly [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2312.4s)]
*  aware that my goat, my Lord and savior, Donald Trump, regardless of what his audience wants, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2318.32s)]
*  regardless of what the right wants, still ended up applying the necessary pressure to facilitate [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2324.48s)]
*  the ceasefire, according to virtually every single person that was involved in the negotiations [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2329.52s)]
*  process, and has now been reported accurately by numerous media outlets, including but not limited [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2335.04s)]
*  to Sky News? I'm going to vote for Donald Trump. Okay. Ay, ay, ay, for God's sake. I'm going to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2340.96s)]
*  vote for Donald Trump. Suck it. Okay. Nothing you can say about it. Even if it's a respite [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2350.64s)]
*  of a collective total of 42 days, probably even shorter than that, Joe Biden never did that. And [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2356.96s)]
*  he had all the power to do so. You will never be able to get me to undermine the truth here. Okay. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2363.2s)]
*  This does not mean that Donald Trump is going to be a good president, nor is he a friend to the [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2371.92s)]
*  Palestinian population. Of course he is not, but neither is Joe Biden. So stop trying to act like, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2375.6s)]
*  stop trying to act as though Joe Biden was in any remotely interested in facilitating a ceasefire [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2381.28s)]
*  when he had all the power to do so, when it would have been electorally beneficial for him to do so, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2385.92s)]
*  when he actually would have at least in some way, shape or form beefed up his legacy. He ruined [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2389.92s)]
*  everything. He ruined himself. He ruined this country. He deliberately threw the election [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2397.68s)]
*  in favor of a right-wing rabbit fascist whose entire cabinet is comprised of rapist drunkards. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2402.0s)]
*  And they're going to destroy the United States of America and perhaps the rest of the goddamn [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2409.68s)]
*  world. And Joe Biden did that because he wanted to die on the penis. He wanted to ride it so hard [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2414.24s)]
*  that his back walls were destroyed and that he wanted to ride it till his last breath. He wanted [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2423.52s)]
*  to die like Elvis on the toilet. Okay. Sucking down a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. But instead [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2428.64s)]
*  of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, it was Benjamin Netanyahu's penis that he was sucking on. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2433.84s)]
*  Okay. Give me a goddamn break. Fuck him and fuck anyone who defends him too. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2438.08s)]
*  You are so brainwashed on what? Brainwash on the truth. What are you talking about? You think Biden? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2446.56s)]
*  Explain to me how you think Biden actually actively, you know, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2452.48s)]
*  curve back Israel's worst genocidal ambitions. I mean, you probably don't even think that Israel's [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2456.4s)]
*  doing a genocide. I suspect if you're saying stuff like this, but go ahead, explain to me. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2460.8s)]
*  It's additionally funny to come in here and say this, like when like virtually every single thing [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2465.12s)]
*  I said down to the wire came out to be true. And it's the worst part about it is that it [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2470.72s)]
*  hasn't happened yet. Like the worst aspect of my predictions have not even come to fruition yet. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2476.4s)]
*  You are so brainwashed. This guy says nothing else. Come on, man. What are you talking about? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2481.52s)]
*  Biden or Bush? Who was worse? I still think it's Bush, but Biden came incredibly close, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2486.48s)]
*  which is shocking. Like think about that. I still think Bush is the worst, right? Like globally. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2491.28s)]
*  I mean, you can even attribute a lot of the missteps within Israel, Palestine and George W. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2500.24s)]
*  Bush as well. On his way out, George W. Bush literally said Georgia and Ukraine should join NATO [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2506.0s)]
*  and also on his, well, not on his way out, but kind of on his way out, actually, no, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2511.6s)]
*  literally on his way out. He tried to facilitate an election in, in Gaza and an election in [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2516.56s)]
*  Palestine when his own people, the Palestinian authority, the Fatah party was like, dude, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  don't do it. We're not ready for this election. We will lose Palestinians despise us. They [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2528.16s)]
*  understandably see us as like a corrupted force that is in the pocket of the CIA. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2532.32s)]
*  Bush was like, nah, dog is fine. We'll do it. And guess what happened? They lost. And then Bush was [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2537.8399999999997s)]
*  like, okay, let's do a coup d'etat and forcibly remove Hamas from power. They lost again, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2544.0s)]
*  militarily this time, further solidifying Hamas's reign over the Gaza Strip. That was George W. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2549.2799999999997s)]
*  Bush on his way out, by the way. That's what he did on his way out while also simultaneously saying, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2554.7999999999997s)]
*  yeah, you know what? Ukraine and Georgia, you're a part of NATO now. Let's get it started. So yes, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2560.48s)]
*  George W. Bush is still the worst, but I always said Donald Trump was the second worst, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2566.48s)]
*  at least as far as like presidents in my lifetime. And it turns out, no, Joe Biden is worse than [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2571.52s)]
*  Donald Trump, at least in his first term. Joe Biden's foreign policy literally was the [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2576.88s)]
*  continuation of Donald Trump's foreign policy. All of the worst aspects of Trump, casting aside [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2583.04s)]
*  the Iran nuclearization agreement. Joe Biden continued that. Abraham Accords, isolating [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2590.0s)]
*  Palestinians, making them recognize that there was no hope, no way out, which led to October 7. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2595.28s)]
*  Joe Biden continued that. Every single thing that Donald Trump did to accelerate the conditions in [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2601.84s)]
*  which October 7 happened, Joe Biden continued. And then Joe Biden continued Israel's offensive [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2608.1600000000003s)]
*  genocidal campaign in Gaza. And then Donald Trump stopped it, at least for a couple days so far. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2614.32s)]
*  Now it hasn't stopped yet and it's going to continue and the bombing is going to intensify [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2621.2s)]
*  because that's how Israel operates. Okay. They're going to intensify the bombing all the way until [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2625.2s)]
*  the 19th, the day of the actual ceasefire. I'm unfollowing a voter for Biden this election. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  And your hatred for him is a turnout for me. No, don't leave chatter. We can recover this. I, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2636.88s)]
*  I know I said I was riding with Biden this whole time and maybe you took it seriously, but that was [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2642.16s)]
*  a lie. Last few months with Iranian proxies across the region being quite severely degraded, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2646.48s)]
*  whether it be Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Syrian regime has gone completely. That of course was [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2653.36s)]
*  aligned to, to, to Iran and the continued. Oh my God. What was Ryan Routh think? Oh my God. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2659.44s)]
*  Ryan Routh was also pro-Palestine dude. Imagine Donald Trump tells Ukraine that they have to, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2664.96s)]
*  they have to reduce their conscription age, mandatory conscription age to 18 [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2672.1600000000003s)]
*  and offers additional weapons contracts to Ukraine and simultaneously facilitated a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2676.8s)]
*  That's literally Ryan Routh's entire world. Okay. He would have to come out and be like, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2683.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm so sorry. I tried to shoot at you. Donald Trump hires the 1000 NATO trained Afghan soldiers [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2688.56s)]
*  to go fight in Ukraine against Russia. Ryan Routh in shambles. My goat, my goat, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2694.48s)]
*  the singular media NATO voter, Ryan Routh in shambles. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2701.6s)]
*  Degrading of Hamas in Gaza. So all of that is a strategic gain and puts Israel in a better [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2706.88s)]
*  position, making it more likely that they would be happy from their part to do a deal. But the [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2713.44s)]
*  other thing that's changed is Trump. And there's no get, there's no two ways about that. His [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2720.64s)]
*  unpredictability has focused minds. There's no question about that. It is focused minds in Qatar, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2727.3599999999997s)]
*  in Egypt, in Iran, and also in Israel. Netanyahu realized over the course of the past 18 months [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2734.16s)]
*  that he didn't need to dance to Joe Biden's tune. That much was proved time and again by the fact [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2742.4s)]
*  that Netanyahu was able to walk over Joe Biden's red lines and nothing happened. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2748.4s)]
*  It's different with Trump. Trump is unpredictable. That claim that all hell would break loose if the [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2754.4s)]
*  hostages were not released very, very quickly after Trump took office. What did that mean? Was [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2759.6800000000003s)]
*  it an empty threat? Was it not an empty threat? Who knows? That's Trump. And I think that focused [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2766.2400000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu's mind. It focused other minds as well. So both sides are obviously trying to claim [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2771.6800000000003s)]
*  all the credit. It's far more nuanced than that. Have a listen to Biden at the end of his statement [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2778.32s)]
*  a little earlier on where he was asked what the history books would make, who they would. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2785.28s)]
*  If something didn't happen and the same cycle of failure repeated for 15 months and then there was [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2790.32s)]
*  a new factor presented, I'm sorry, it's very difficult for me to avoid looking at the new [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2797.92s)]
*  factor that is now involved in the equation after the 15 months of failure changed into a success. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2804.72s)]
*  Like it's no amount of complexities understanding is going to change that dynamic. Okay. It's just [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2811.6s)]
*  too complex for you to understand. Just like Israel's genocide, too complex for you to understand [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2818.9599999999996s)]
*  him. No, it's actually too complex for you to understand. That's why you should demonstrate [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2823.52s)]
*  blind field to me. Okay. And Joseph Robin at Brandon, that he magically was able to [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2829.44s)]
*  finally put this deal together that he was tirelessly working around the clock on [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2836.1600000000003s)]
*  five days before he was out of office. He just couldn't do it for 15 months until the last five [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2841.36s)]
*  days. Your brain was shut up. No more. Your brainwash. You have to tell me why I'm brainwashed. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2848.32s)]
*  What your disagreement with me is. It's so boring when you say that would give the credit. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2854.16s)]
*  So I knew this deal would have to be implemented by the next team. So I told my team to coordinate [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2859.3599999999997s)]
*  closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2866.24s)]
*  what American presidents do. So you don't think the ceasefire negotiations would have progressed [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2872.7999999999997s)]
*  if Kamala won? I don't know, but I don't have to. Do you understand? I don't know, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2878.56s)]
*  but I don't have to because Trump is president now and it is their doing. Those two figures, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2885.04s)]
*  those three figures really are primarily responsible for all of the hell that you are [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2891.04s)]
*  going to experience in the next four years. And that's really important for everyone to understand. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2896.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. That's really important for everyone to understand. You can engage in hypotheticals all [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2904.32s)]
*  day, every day, speculate on what Kamala Harris could have done that's like so different than [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2909.2000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden. Okay. And have fun with that. But as it stands, their ineptitude, their incompetence, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2914.4s)]
*  their lust for endless child blood in the Gaza Strip is one of the major reasons as to why [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2922.6400000000003s)]
*  they handed the keys to the castle to an incompetent, monstrous, racist man whose agenda [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2931.92s)]
*  is virtually identical to the Nazi agenda. 20 million people being forcibly removed from [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2941.6s)]
*  their homes and being put into concentration camps at the border slated for evacuation, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2949.04s)]
*  slated for deportation. Okay. Those three gave the keys to the castle to that guy and that campaign. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2956.96s)]
*  So all matter of horrifying things that happen, okay. All matter of horrifying things that happen [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2966.16s)]
*  come in the next couple of months. They are also responsible because they were so horny to maintain [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2971.92s)]
*  this weird posture with Israel, so excited at the continued baby murder that they were just, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2979.84s)]
*  they forgot that there was an election going on, I think. Is that a joke? Oh, thank you. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2987.6000000000004s)]
*  That remark there, Mark, is that a joke? And while we were in that press conference with the Qatari [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=2993.2000000000003s)]
*  prime minister, we saw Donald Trump put out a statement on truth social even before the [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3000.6400000000003s)]
*  Qatari's had fully said that this deal was over the line. Yeah, he was the first to make a statement [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3006.96s)]
*  even before the outgoing administration of Biden made any sort of noises about whether or not a [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3015.04s)]
*  deal had been struck. Trump was on social media, on truth social, with this statement. He said, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3022.0s)]
*  this epic ceasefire agreement could only have happened as a result of our historic victory in [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3027.44s)]
*  November as it signaled to the entire world that my administration would seek peace and negotiate [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3032.72s)]
*  deals to ensure that all of our Americans, that all Americans, the safety of all Americans and our [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  allies. And it continued, we will continue promoting peace through strength throughout the region as we [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3043.8399999999997s)]
*  build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the historic Abraham Accords. Now, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3049.4399999999996s)]
*  I yelled at the Abraham Accords was a deal done in the first Trump presidency that saw Israeli [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3055.84s)]
*  normalization with certain Gulf Arab states. It was a remarkable moment in itself, but it has been [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3064.7200000000003s)]
*  set back massively by the events of October the 7th and what followed after that. Now, as I said [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3071.84s)]
*  a little earlier on- Bro, it's just like, I can't begin to explain to you how stupid everything [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3079.1200000000003s)]
*  that we experienced over the past 15 months, because I've been so hyper focused on how [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3085.68s)]
*  unimaginably cruel and violent it's been. But like, I want to remind you that 80% [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3090.3199999999997s)]
*  of the Democratic Party's base of support wanted a ceasefire. 54% of Republicans wanted a ceasefire. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3097.12s)]
*  54% of Republicans wanted a ceasefire. 70% of independents wanted a ceasefire. So the [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3105.76s)]
*  Democratic Party did not do this because there were so many like Israel dick riders in its ranks, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3115.28s)]
*  maybe in its institutions, but certainly not in its base of support. 75% of American Jews [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3120.6400000000003s)]
*  wanted a ceasefire. The only group where something close to the majority actually [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3127.36s)]
*  didn't want a ceasefire was evangelical Christian Zionists. And they've never voted for the [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3134.24s)]
*  Republican- They've never voted for the Democratic Party. Never! That's so insane to me. 25% of the [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3140.9599999999996s)]
*  most conservative American Jews and like 35% of the broader electorate, that is the most conservative [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3147.6s)]
*  American Christians, that have never voted for the Democrats and never will vote for the Democrats [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3153.9199999999996s)]
*  because they think Democrats are pedophilic vampires that were already going to vote for [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3159.04s)]
*  the Republicans were the only constituency relied by Lebanese parliamentary law, Lebanese constitution. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3163.2s)]
*  However, this is an antiquated relic of French colonial ambition, a DEI effort, if you will. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3172.16s)]
*  So therefore I, Bernie Sanders, will now be the new president of Lebanon, the first Jewish president [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3181.7599999999998s)]
*  of Lebanon bucket. Why not? You know, we're fantasizing. Yeah, absolutely. And we're expecting [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3191.92s)]
*  that inauguration of Donald Trump next Monday. And as you say, that ceasefire agreement is expected to [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3198.88s)]
*  kick in on Sunday. Mark, thanks so much for bringing us up. It'd be so fucking funny. If you saw this [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3207.36s)]
*  after the interview just had, yeah, apparently CNN used the clip from my interview already with [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3212.4s)]
*  Bernie Sanders on their news coverage. So it's really, it is kind of GGs. If any of your parents [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3217.12s)]
*  actually accidentally were like, Oh, isn't that that, that socialist kid you listened to? And then [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3223.44s)]
*  like tuned in. And then they saw me doing this. They're going to be like, this is the worst thing [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3229.44s)]
*  I've ever seen. Why you're no longer allowed to watch this. Up to date. And Mark was talking there [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3234.16s)]
*  about normalization that Israel wants with Saudi Arabia. Well, Saudi officials have maintained [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3240.72s)]
*  them. They've certainly told me that they have, they are focused on normalization only if there [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3246.4s)]
*  is a Palestinian state. Oh, now we're back to the, to the Senate. Thank me later for finding this. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3253.6s)]
*  We'll see if Trump, if Trump ends, if Trump stops the government for doing an apartheid, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3261.6800000000003s)]
*  I will do the fucking tasteful photo shoot. No Dick tasteful nude. Yeah, that was ending the apartheid, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3269.04s)]
*  not ceasefire. For those of you who misunderstood what I was saying to Bradley Martin, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3275.44s)]
*  because time and time again, I repeated the position that I likely believe that Donald Trump [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3280.8s)]
*  will get an optics victory here for a at least momentary ceasefire. And then Yahoo will give it [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3286.0s)]
*  to them. Semantics show us your hog. You literally are nevermind. I'm not going to say what you do [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3293.6s)]

*  potentially. I don't know exactly how he's going to do it, but the mad lad says he wants to do a [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3741.44s)]
*  president like Donald Trump is considering issue an executive order once in office that [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3745.76s)]
*  will suspend the enforcement of ticktock sailor ban law for 60 to 90 days, hoping, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3749.36s)]
*  hoping for a brief reprieve for the Chinese own app that will net him an early victory. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3754.32s)]
*  Trump has been mulling ways to save the day for the wildly popular video app. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3758.6400000000003s)]
*  170 million people, dude. That's an automatic lock. Okay. That is an automatic lock, dude. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3762.4s)]
*  Trump has been mulling ways to save the day for the wildly popular video app, talking [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3770.48s)]
*  through unconventional deal-making and legal maneuvers. That's crazy. That's my go right [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3774.0s)]

*  close to Biden. As you guys know, openly talking about how Trump played a big role in this in the [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3784.32s)]
*  final push. First about Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump was a, an important factor in this [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3788.96s)]
*  deal. His involvement, I think was, you know, the, the, you know, five cents to the dollar [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3797.44s)]
*  that was missing. I think his public statement threatening that there'll be hell to pay in the [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3804.8s)]
*  Middle East. There's no deal was extremely important. I think the fact that he, he and [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3811.44s)]
*  the Biden administration, I think Joe Biden and Donald Trump. What the fuck is wrong with you [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3816.56s)]

*  they get better pay highlighting the mistreatment of prisoners across the board. Yeah. Me and me and [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3836.96s)]
*  unc unc shaky Gerga are totally in line. Okay. You will never hear me say crime is bad. Okay. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3843.2799999999997s)]
*  I will always and forever maintain the position that crime is very good. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3850.32s)]
*  Trump did something that I think no us presidents and president elect ever did. They worked together [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3854.6400000000003s)]
*  during the transition period on a huge diplomatic deal and got it. Biden's envoy, Brett McGurk and [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3861.2000000000003s)]
*  Trump's own voice, Steve Witkoff set together in the meetings in Doha in the negotiations. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3869.04s)]
*  Yeah. So first about Donald Trump, I think. Yep. Anyway. All right. Where were we? Where were we? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3875.7599999999998s)]
*  Where were we? Um, what else? Oh, we covered all this. Here's a brief moment of solace from [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3881.44s)]
*  Shao Hong Shu. What Drake is saying that not like us is antisemitic. What? No, you just sent me the [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3888.16s)]
*  other ProPublica reporting on the Gaza thing. What is this? Drake is also alleging that not like [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3901.36s)]
*  is not like us is antisemitic furthering the recording recordings, refrain that Drake is [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3907.04s)]
*  not like us. The recording of lose the Drake's Jewish heritage saying Drake is not a colleague, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3912.08s)]
*  but a fucking colonizer. Oh my God. Oh my God. Is he saying, cause Drake was like, look, credit [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3916.2400000000002s)]
*  work credit is due. Drake did literally sign off. He was pro. I think he was the first major [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3922.56s)]
*  musician, major celebrity that signed off on the ceasefire artists for a ceasefire, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3930.88s)]
*  something that I have maintained. Okay. Maybe a little overlocked in Lee because not the biggest [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3937.44s)]
*  Drake fan, but I have said that. Okay. I have, I have openly mentioned this numerous times on [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3942.0s)]
*  numerous occasions. Okay. Is he trying to say that like, Oh, you're calling me a colonizer, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3948.72s)]
*  like likening what I'm doing to Israel because of my Jewish background. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3954.8799999999997s)]
*  Interesting take. He's saying you can, you can call me whatever, but not compare me to what [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3962.64s)]
*  Israel is doing. I'm just saying interesting take from him. And there's at least enough evidence [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3968.3199999999997s)]
*  that Drake is not pro Israel. Drake alleges in the lawsuit that UMG permitted content [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3974.08s)]
*  criticism, just Kyson at Zia's no life shack, RDC gaming and Cardi, Cardi, or family to monetize [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3978.4s)]
*  reactions and not like us without enforcing copyright claims. He claims that this lack of [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3983.84s)]
*  enforcement enabled the spread of defamatory content while generating profits for both UMG [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3986.72s)]
*  and the creators prioritizing revenue over Drake's secure safety. Oh my God. He called out RDC and [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3990.72s)]
*  Kyson at. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL9MKJg0ihc&t=3996.64s)]
