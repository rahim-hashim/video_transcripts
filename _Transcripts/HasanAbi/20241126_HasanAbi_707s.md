*  So they turn their offline shade chat into a hay watch at no way. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=10.9s)]
*  That's that's the craziest part about it is that the craziest part about it is that like while [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=14.8s)]

*  Yeah, we are doing it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=22.8s)]
*  I'm based for being a cyber stalker. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=24.0s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=31.0s)]
*  This is from YouTube drama. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=33.2s)]
*  Every community that did EG brigades turns into the same shit show. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=35.4s)]
*  Just a Hassan Abisnark page Lameo. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=39.3s)]
*  I saw h3 subreddit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=41.4s)]
*  I think you should make other accounts and just brigade like all in harass these people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=43.7s)]
*  Like if he's just going to accuse us of doing every single thing that he literally does on his community, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=47.8s)]
*  like you can literally watch Hassan astroturf LSF and YouTube comment sections in real time live. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=52.2s)]
*  Like he does it on his stream. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=57.3s)]
*  So if you think so, then do it like other accounts make sure you have a VPN. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=58.4s)]
*  I need to be I think there's something very funny about him saying this while he's literally tracking my [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=61.4s)]
*  discord on his own subreddit was 700 upvotes and acting as though he hasn't been doing that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=69.6s)]
*  Like I don't even think this works right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=75.7s)]
*  Like does this gaslighting ever work on anybody does it I tweeted actively demanding his audience is wild [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=78.8s)]
*  except this even while there's this gremlin trying to gaslight people in acting like he wasn't already doing this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=85.3s)]
*  while this community is stalking my discord. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=89.5s)]
*  He's saying he wants to openly brigade. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=92.0s)]
*  It's a banable offense by YouTube and I assume virtually every other platform by the way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=94.5s)]
*  I got their accounts make sure you have a VPN. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=100.4s)]
*  I need a VPN sponsor. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=101.7s)]
*  Yeah and do it and harass them or abuse them or whatever every I guess that's what you want to do. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  I mean I mean because there's no difference between I didn't even say anything. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  I just didn't say anything because we're all doing that already. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  Right. So okay. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=112.30000000000001s)]

*  I think you need to perish from this chat. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=119.9s)]
*  This and he asked his community to continue doing what they're already doing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=123.3s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=126.3s)]

*  They brigade like no other subreddit the H3 subreddit has more overlap with this community any other entirely [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=129.1s)]
*  because they've been on they've been doing an anti-assam Brigade. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=133.7s)]
*  There literally was never as much overlap between the Hassan sub and H3 sub when they did a show together. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=137.1s)]
*  The mission is on instantly receives the entire destiny community. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=141.79999999999998s)]

*  And it's like this is a community that like thrives on edgy discourse that oh they are they're literally immediately saying the sick man. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  We all are powerful edgy discourse that will also cry because someone personally said that like he reads Wikipedia like they'll lose their minds. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  Oh my God, they're all spamming the instantly as their hate watch the hinges like has apparently a wonderful little segment called rape review [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=233.6s)]
*  that is community calls when they look at like victims of sexual assault and find ways to poke holes in their arguments. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=244.2s)]
*  So that's cool. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=251.2s)]
*  And last but not least is always doing projection does a metric ton of awful shit to other content creators and then personally turns around [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  and says we are the real victims here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=262.4s)]
*  Actually, why the fuck does nobody like us? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=264.3s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=266.7s)]
*  He 100% watches. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=267.9s)]
*  He's like he knows they're like, yeah, he knows what we do in here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=269.3s)]
*  But then have the other half is like, no, they're lying. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=274.2s)]
*  They don't you do that Hassan own personally is over working. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  We report the shit. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=280.9s)]
*  I don't think there's much you can do to report it to be fair. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  And yeah, he's it seems like it seems like his community does a good bit of opens up politics during you know, tile the fuck up. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=285.0s)]
*  I'll say with politics. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't get how reddit and YouTube is still okay with it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=295.5s)]
*  I don't think people have like reported this kind of stuff. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=297.7s)]
*  That's probably what it is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=301.6s)]
*  But I'm sure reddit is aware of destiny subreddit like actively brigading, you know, a song their community logs every message posted in this chat. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=303.2s)]
*  Yeah, I know I heard that a DGG or got made mod of the h3 subreddit. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=310.9s)]
*  That's why it looks more insane. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=315.5s)]
*  Oh nice. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=317.09999999999997s)]

*  Wait, what the fuck? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=328.29999999999995s)]
*  They just have a straight embed on their website. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=330.2s)]
*  It's not a showing a live chat reaction where you said, oh, they're this is right now in real time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=332.9s)]

*  That's crazy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=346.8s)]
*  I'm one of the strongest hate watchers and I'm not in the video. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=347.9s)]
*  Dude, I swear to God it is I've said this time and time again, like it is not healthy to behave like this to all the stalkers. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=350.9s)]
*  Hello. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=360.1s)]

*  You will fix your life. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=368.1s)]
*  But the first step is just moving away from these communities that you're a part of that you feel like you have a sense of purpose in is just making you a sadder person. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=370.1s)]
*  I promise it is harming you more than it does me. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=380.8s)]
*  I know you think it's harming me and you can't cope with the reality that it doesn't you know, like none of these initiatives have been successful. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=384.5s)]
*  After five years and maybe one day it will be you know what I mean? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=392.5s)]
*  One day one day we'll get them is going to happen and it pisses him off or anything like that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  And then when you can't figure out why like other other content creators don't have the same energy that you guys have towards me and then you're like how was this possible? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=402.4s)]
*  Why did they not like my God King destiny the same way that they like us on? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=411.79999999999995s)]

*  Is that what it is? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  And then you end up compounding on the crazy ass shit. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=419.0s)]
*  You become like a QAnon person. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=423.1s)]

*  I mean, I routinely talk to people that I not only disagree with but also actively seek out other content creators and do try to expand. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=481.3s)]
*  I mean, I'm doing mainstream media and not only that but also, you know, collaborating with other content creators and whatnot. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=492.5s)]
*  Did you see this? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=499.8s)]
*  They talked about you on a radio show. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=500.4s)]
*  I did not. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=502.1s)]
*  What is this? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=502.8s)]
*  The guest called you hot. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=503.7s)]
*  What's the time code listener supported 1859? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=505.2s)]
*  Did I did I listen to we'll talk about Joe Rogan, you know, again, like I said earlier, we'll find right of mainstream media Institute that people get on the right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=509.5s)]
*  So here's a one-minute sample for listeners who don't know Hassan piker that sort of left of center influence influencer. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=518.1s)]
*  You're just talking about describing the media diet for his cohort. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=524.8s)]
*  And this is from a crooked media clip that was published on November 6th. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=530.5s)]
*  If you're a dude under the age of 30 and you have any hobbies whatsoever, whether it's playing video games, whether it's working out, whether it's I don't know listening to like a history podcast or whatever every single facet of that is just completely dominated by center, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=535.2s)]
*  To I wouldn't say far right in the same way that it was back in like the 2016 era at the end of like Obama's administration, but like definitely center, right to Trump Ian, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=551.6s)]
*  Like openly Trump, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=562.6s)]
*  Not like genuinely neo-Nazi. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=563.9s)]
*  That part is quieted down a little bit, but like they're like 90% of the way there for the most part. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=566.5s)]
*  Hasmah's not everyone likes you. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=571.5s)]
*  I know there's plenty of people that don't like me. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=573.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=575.2s)]
*  Um, it's all good. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=575.6s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=576.7s)]
*  Everything that they see is right wing sentiment being expressed by individuals that they find charismatic thought leaders influencers that they subscribe to. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=577.4s)]
*  And I think that that is some of the reason why you see this movement. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  Hassan piker who himself I gather is 33 years old. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=592.1s)]
*  Want to expand on that at all? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=596.9s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=599.0s)]
*  I think the draw that Hassan has that a lot of other influencers on the left don't have is that he is this like really hot funny guy and a lot of these kind of other influencers on like the center, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=599.7s)]
*  And stuff who cover, you know, gaming and sports and stuff, but do have these center, right? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=611.2s)]
*  They're mostly just like dudes having fun. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=615.6999999999999s)]
*  And I think one thing that's really important is that these influencers are creating a sense of community and they're flattering the same grievances that a lot of young men have like young men are so lonely and scared. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=617.8s)]
*  And they, you know, are part of this sort of wider backlash to feminism at this exact moment. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=629.5999999999999s)]
*  And these influencers are are speaking to them in that way because they're like dudes having fun together doing dude stuff. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=634.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think any kind of answer for the left if you want to call it that has to reckon with that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=642.4s)]
*  Shanita in Brooklyn, you're on WNYC. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-hbgmNPec&t=647.1s)]
