# This Is Getting WORSE | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64)
*  India literally... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=0.0s)]
*  What are we talking about? India has been doing targeted campaigns of... [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3.04s)]
*  Like, what is it called? The Sikh activists that existed on Canadian soil, on sovereign soil. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=9.0s)]
*  In the Western world. It's completely ridiculous. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=17.68s)]
*  Yo, Xylax with a 3000. We're almost... [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=21.16s)]
*  Oh my God, we're about to hit 200k. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Alright, we'll get started on why two nuclear powers are on the brink of war, okay? India versus Pakistan. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=31.0s)]
*  Hold on one second. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=37.0s)]
*  The Kashmir conflict has shaped South Asian geopolitics for more than seven decades. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=38.0s)]
*  The struggle between India and Pakistan over the territory has led to multiple wars. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=43.0s)]
*  And the area is now one of the most militarized in the world. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=47.0s)]
*  India and Pakistan are once again on the brink of all-out war. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=51.0s)]
*  But to understand the present tensions, you need to go back in time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=55.0s)]
*  Let's rewind to 1947. This is what the map looked like when Britain partitioned its former colony. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=58.0s)]
*  Pakistan, with a Muslim majority, was created in the West. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=66.0s)]
*  And India, to the East, with a mostly Hindu population. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=69.0s)]
*  War quickly followed in October. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=73.0s)]
*  The Hindu ruler of the Muslim majority, Jammu and Kashmir, originally sought to remain independent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=76.0s)]
*  But when Pakistani militants invaded Kashmir, he appealed for Indian military help. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=81.0s)]
*  The ensuing war lasted until an armistice was implemented on the 1st of January, 1949. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=87.0s)]
*  Splitting Kashmir into two parts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=94.0s)]
*  Tensions continued, though, with the second Indo-Pakistan war in 1965. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=97.0s)]
*  Again, over a border dispute. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=103.0s)]
*  And the last conflict in 1999. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=105.0s)]
*  But by this point, both countries had gained atomic weapons, raising fears of a nuclear confrontation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=107.0s)]
*  Since then, both sides have continued to face off over Kashmir, with accusations of Pakistani support for something Islamabad denies. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=114.0s)]
*  The Mumbai attack was by far the most devastating known inside India as its 9-11. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=123.0s)]
*  In 2008, 166 people were killed over four days when ten heavily armed gunmen arrived by sea from Pakistan, unleashing a coordinated wave of... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=129.0s)]
*  The latest confrontation began two weeks ago after another barbaric attack. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=140.0s)]
*  This time in India-administered Kashmir. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=144.0s)]
*  A popular tourist destination was targeted. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=147.0s)]
*  26 people killed. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=150.0s)]
*  One assailant reportedly told a survivor, go tell this to Prime Minister Modi. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=152.0s)]
*  The calculated targeting of tourists appeared designed to provoke a strong Indian response. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=156.0s)]
*  The attack was blamed on a group calling itself the Resistance Front. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=161.0s)]
*  And it has links to Lashk-e-Taiba, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=166.0s)]
*  the same organisation behind the Mumbai attacks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=168.0s)]
*  India has long claimed L.E.T. is used as a proxy, something Pakistan denies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=171.0s)]
*  It says New Delhi has failed to show any evidence of complicity. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=176.0s)]
*  India says its response has been measured and is not escalatory. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=182.0s)]
*  But by striking compounds in the Pakistani heartland of Punjab, it's not being seen that way by Islamabad. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=187.0s)]
*  Pakistan is calling the a**-bikes and the main worry for the world and the region are the nuclear missiles aimed at each other. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=194.0s)]
*  Pakistan has around 170 and India has 164. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=202.0s)]
*  But even if the tensions are dialled down, as we've seen throughout the history, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=208.0s)]
*  the underlying causes of the Kashmir dispute steeped in unresolved colonial legacy will remain and could break out at any time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=214.0s)]
*  Moving on to other news today that we have to get to, including new fighting between two nuclear armed powers, India and Pakistan. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=225.0s)]
*  We are now seeing the damage after India sites inside Pakistani controlled territory last night. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=233.0s)]
*  This was in response to a recent check. My previous messages. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=238.0s)]
*  This is a huge oversimplification of Kashmir. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=242.0s)]
*  Hari Singh base basically treated Kashmir as a slave. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=244.0s)]
*  As I mentioned last time I was on the show. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=247.0s)]
*  Yes, Arun and myself had a long conversation about this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=249.0s)]
*  You can find it on my YouTube. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=256.0s)]
*  It was very enlightening. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=258.0s)]
*  It was very informative. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=261.0s)]
*  And it was also contrary to what you normally see. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=262.0s)]
*  Contrary to what you would normally see in mainstream news, it was Kashmir centric. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=266.0s)]
*  The focus of the story surrounded the Kashmir population rather than Pakistan or the Indian interests, like the interest of the Indian nation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=273.0s)]
*  I don't know where this goes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=287.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=290.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know where this is going to head, but considering that these are both two nuclear armed nations, I feel like it can't escalate beyond this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=291.0s)]
*  Even though I do feel as though right now we are we are entering a new meta. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=302.0s)]
*  We are entering a new territory where international human rights or even like military international human rights is in the pooper. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=310.0s)]
*  OK. Previously, it was only it was only America that got to violate international human rights and Israel by extension of America. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=321.0s)]
*  And sometimes other allies of America, as long as like the people that they were killing were powerless. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=330.0s)]
*  Right. The new world order beyond that is officially becoming everyone gets to do America shit now in their own way, in their own backyard. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=337.0s)]
*  And it is definitely a scary meta. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=349.0s)]
*  Like what India did in retaliation to Pakistan is crazy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=354.0s)]
*  You can't just conduct the operation and civilian targets on a sovereign nation's territory on sovereign soil. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=361.0s)]
*  Yeah, likely Pakistan will respond in kind using cruiser ballistic targets inside India proper and Indian administrative Kashmir as India struck both inside of Pakistan proper and Pakistan [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=369.0s)]
*  and administrative Kashmir. Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=379.0s)]
*  Like it's every country, every country is just now doing crazy stuff. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=382.0s)]
*  India thinks it's inside the club. India has always thought that it is inside the club. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=391.0s)]
*  India literally sinated. What are we talking about? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=396.0s)]
*  India has been doing targeted campaigns of of like what is called the sick activists that existed on Canadian soil on sovereign soil in the Western world is completely ridiculous. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=400.0s)]
*  Yo, Xylax with a three thousand. We're almost. Oh, my God, we're about to hit two hundred K. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=418.0s)]
*  We can and we will. They were not civilian targets. You would understand if you lost a loved one. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=424.0s)]
*  I like that everyone turns into Israel the moment that it's like an issue. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=429.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter what their perspective is. It doesn't matter how they're guided or rooted in empathy in their worldview. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=433.0s)]
*  It literally everyone turns into like, no, these are all these are all and this is it is what it is. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=440.0s)]
*  Like it's it's perfectly permissible to conduct a military operation on foreign soil without the go ahead of the country itself. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=448.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you talking about? Even if they are literally actual. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=457.0s)]
*  OK, like straightforward, rugged that India was striking. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=462.0s)]
*  You can't do that without permission from the sovereign nation that you're striking. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=468.0s)]
*  And it's not just like India mirroring Israel. Everyone is doing this like every country is doing this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=473.0s)]
*  Pakistan is Val retaliation. I don't know what that looks like yet, but the attacks that Pakistan launched in Pune don't count. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=479.0s)]
*  Indians aren't seeing straight. They've become bloodlust. They can't see the consequences of this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=484.0s)]
*  Indian cities will be attacked. Now I've been jumping up and down. I'm going to I mean, I don't know if I'll ruin. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=488.0s)]
*  Maybe I'll have you on a little bit like later because I'm I'm going to be doing something that's not like heavily political in a moment. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=495.0s)]
*  In a brief moment, you know. Look, this guy's response is the USA conducted an operation to catch Osama bin Laden inside Pakistan. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=503.0s)]
*  Yeah, but first of all, what are you? That's my point. India thinks is doing America shit. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=512.0s)]
*  India can't do America shit. America shouldn't be doing America shit, let alone India doing America shit. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=519.0s)]
*  That's the that's what I'm saying. Like there were rules of engagement that people loosely tried to follow to the best of their ability, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=524.0s)]
*  because there was this attitude overall that's that, you know, that stated that you can't do whatever you want. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=533.0s)]
*  Why would a country give another permission, give permission to another country to them? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=543.0s)]
*  I mean, it depends. It depends on what the what the military action looks like. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=547.0s)]
*  I don't think Pakistan would allow India to enter Pakistan airspace and just like deep into or any part of Pakistan territory. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=554.0s)]
*  Black smoke. Oh, my God. Pope watch is already coming to a close. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=565.0s)]
*  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to move on really quickly to raw dogging real quick because oh, black smoke is no new pope. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=570.0s)]
*  Sorry, white smoke is the new pope, right? Blanking breaking black smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel, meaning no new pope yet. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=579.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. For a second, I got excited. That's right. White smoke is the is the new pope, right? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=585.0s)]
*  Black smoke means no new pope. Yeah. As you guys know, as you guys know, I'm in favor of Pinoy gang here for the new pope. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=591.0s)]
*  But here, let's just continue with the story for now. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=598.0s)]
*  And terror attack. Dozens are dead. Remy Inosincio has the latest on this. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=600.0s)]
*  Strategic U.S. partners on the brink of war again. Indian missiles overnight slammed into Pakistan controlled territory. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=609.0s)]
*  Delhi unleashed more after sunrise in what it called Operation Sindor, destroying what it said were nine terrorist campsites, taking revenge against Pakistan for gunmen who two weeks ago [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=617.0s)]
*  massacred 26 people, mostly Hindu men, at a tourist hotspot here high in the Himalayas in the disputed Kashmir region, which both India and Pakistan claim. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=628.0s)]
*  President Trump weighed in. It's a shame we just heard about it. I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=639.0s)]
*  They've been fighting for a long time. The two nuclear armed neighbors have fought three wars over Kashmir, killing at least 10,000 people since the 1940s. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=646.0s)]
*  And now with dozens more dead and wounded. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=655.0s)]
*  Indians celebrating retaliation, Pakistan claiming it down five Indian aircraft and vowing more retribution. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=662.0s)]
*  Tensions are again spiraling out between the two fighting and dying over land. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=668.0s)]
*  And India is holding mock security drills today, prepping for Pakistan to launch a counterattack. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=674.0s)]
*  These include air raid sirens, simulations for blackouts if they occur and rehearsals for evacuation across the country. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=680.0s)]
*  Adriana. All right, Remy, thank you so much. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=687.0s)]
*  It's what the world feared and Pakistan expected. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=691.0s)]
*  Loud explosions fill the sky in the early hours of the morning in Pakistan's controlled territory of Kashmir. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=701.0s)]
*  Pakistan claims people were killed, including a child and several injured, describing the attack as a blatant act of war. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=710.0s)]
*  India says they hit terrorist infrastructure. It's the I'm from India watching from India, but they say no civilian has been killed. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=726.0s)]
*  They have targeted terrorists. I'm totally OK with your Palestinian Israel perspective. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=733.0s)]
*  But India never targets innocent civilians. All states target innocent civilians. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=737.0s)]
*  OK, the notion that India doesn't target innocent civilians is fucking insane. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=743.0s)]
*  OK, every state targets innocent civilians. What are you talking about? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=749.0s)]
*  Like, look at the fucking headline, dude. Pakistan officials say 26 civilians killed in attack. Are we also. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=754.0s)]
*  Are we are we? What is happening, man? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=760.0s)]
*  What's happening, man? I found them on them. I'm live. What's going on? Are you OK? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=763.0s)]
*  Defense Ministry released a statement saying altogether nine sites have been targeted. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=769.0s)]
*  It's crazy. Our actions have been focused, measured and non escalatory in nature. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=775.0s)]
*  No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=780.0s)]
*  India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and methods of execution. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=784.0s)]
*  These steps come in the wake of the barbaric Helga terrorist attack in which 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen was murdered. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=791.0s)]
*  We are living up to the commitments that those response. Yeah, Pakistan run health agency. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=800.0s)]
*  Just like Hamas run health agency, I guess. Is this going to turn into Hindus or fascist versus like Muslims? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=806.0s)]
*  Muslims, therefore, the Western world's attitude on it is going to be like geared towards undermining the Muslim side to be like, well, it's Pakistan. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=814.0s)]
*  They're Muslim. Obviously, they're frigging lying. Right. Like that's I suspect that that is what like the angle is going to be. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=823.0s)]
*  Oh, my Lord. I don't know why, but Masad tweet that no aircraft is shoot down. What Masad? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=829.0s)]
*  I. OK. So for this attack will be held accountable. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=835.0s)]
*  Pakistan air defenses says they have downed Indian planes. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=845.0s)]
*  Those claims have not been confirmed. There has been intense shelling and firing across the line of control. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=849.0s)]
*  A Muslim captain from India led this. So don't call this Hindu versus Muslim. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=856.0s)]
*  OK, dude, listen, I'm going to be I'm going to keep it a buck fifty with all of you guys. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=864.0s)]
*  OK, the more you talk about it like this, the more I'm beginning to develop a level of resentment because this is literally turning into like this is this is just Indian Hasbara. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=869.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you going to act like Modi is not a fucking Hindu to a fascist? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=881.0s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? Is that is that not the case? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=886.0s)]
*  Like, totally separately from this from this situation, like, oh, dude, it's a Muslim captain. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=890.0s)]
*  That led this. OK, I guess. OK, then then let's let's just rewrite all the pogroms that have taken place. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=896.0s)]
*  You know, meanwhile, every single every single defender of these actions is basically fucking paying for blood paying for Muslim blood specifically. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=904.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. What you're really going to ignore Pakistan strategy is sponsoring this group, which was actually taught to them by the USA daddy against Soviets in Afghanistan. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=913.0s)]
*  No, the former defense minister, I believe that was his title openly admitted to that. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=921.0s)]
*  OK, both of these countries do the exact same thing where they where they try to instill separatist movements. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=927.0s)]
*  The ethno-nationalist slogan for Indian Hindus was literally trending on Twitter last night. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=938.0s)]
*  She's about to get mega fashion real quick. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=942.0s)]
*  Pakistan has the right to respond. Pakistan will respond. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=944.0s)]
*  As I've said before, we had an apprehension that India will attack. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=948.0s)]
*  Pakistan has never struck first, but we have the right to self-defense. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=952.0s)]
*  Kashmir is the crown over which the two nuclear armed neighbors have fought several wars and are in a fight for their rights. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=958.0s)]
*  Kashmir is the crown over which the two nuclear armed neighbors have fought several wars and are in a perpetual state of tension. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=967.0s)]
*  These attacks can soon become a flash point that the world needs to be worried of its consequence. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=976.0s)]
*  Well, Neville joins us live now. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=985.0s)]
*  Neville, I guess the first question is put in context for us the scale of military engagement we've seen in the last 24 hours. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=988.0s)]
*  Well, this is this is a sort of a nuclear flash point. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1000.0s)]
*  Kashmir has been called that the two nuclear armed neighbors have had several wars over Kashmir. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1003.0s)]
*  There's been skirmishes. There's been sort of eye to eye, eyeball to eyeball, military soldiers looking at each other and and and along the 740 kilometer line of control in Kashmir. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1011.0s)]
*  There has been the Pakistan based leader of a militant group has said 10 of his relatives have been killed in a missile strike by India. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1027.0s)]
*  Doesn't attack citizens, by the way. Yeah, I know a chatter actually linked this to me to say, no, this is confirmation that they are only striking terrorists. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1033.0s)]
*  Ironically enough, they didn't realize that this is actually a confirmation that they're not only striking terrorists, that they're actually killing civilians. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1040.0s)]
*  Okay. This is only this only works if you are like, oh, well, they're relatives of of of militant leaders. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1048.0s)]
*  Well, I guess they're fucking, you know, open targeting now. Like, I guess they can do that. Then you can just die. It's fine. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1055.0s)]
*  Oh my God. My whole family is fucking calling me. What is happening? They're literally all around the planet. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1062.0s)]
*  So they have very different they're they're in different time zones. So they think that, you know, I'm supposed to be flying right now. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1068.0s)]
*  And they just think like I'm not live and they don't check to see if I'm live and they just keep calling me to be like, when are you landing? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1078.0s)]
*  Oh my Lord. The Pakistan based leader of a militant group has said 10 of his brothers have been killed in a missile strike by India. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1085.0s)]
*  Masood Azhar, chief of Jai Shem Mohammed Jem said his older sister and his husband, his nephew, his nephew's wife, his niece, five children from his family were killed in a strike on a mosque in Baha Walpur, Pakistan. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1091.0s)]
*  India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan, admission Kashmir on Tuesday night. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1102.0s)]
*  Islamabad called the strikes a heinous act of aggression. Rokana defended India. Are you fucking kidding me? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1106.0s)]
*  India took a response to help take out some of the terrorist networks. Are you joking? Come on, dude. What the hell is going on? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1113.0s)]
*  What is this? Sorry, please try to pronounce it slightly better. Love you, dude. Come on, dog. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1120.0s)]
*  Rokana met with Hindu nationalist commentator Abhijit Iyarmitra. There is this is nothing new to me. What the fuck? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1126.0s)]
*  Firing, shelling, small on fire. Since the time the attack happened on the tourists in in Bihelgaon on the 22nd of April. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1136.0s)]
*  They've they've been continuous firing across the across the line of small arms fire. But now overnight, we've seen these heavy shelling. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1146.0s)]
*  India has said that a number of people have been killed and also a number of homes have been damaged in the Kupwara region. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1155.0s)]
*  Now we can't confirm that. But across the line as well, there's been there's been information of damage. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1163.0s)]
*  Do I think China will try to interfere in a significant way? Yes. This is happening in their backyard. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1171.0s)]
*  This is incredibly threatening to their their global stability initiatives. So, yes, I do think that they will they will try to intervene. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1180.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. Also, India plays a very important role in America's trade agenda. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1192.0s)]
*  OK, India is supposed to be our guys over there in terms of like a manufacturing hub that we can use as as we try to get everyone else to decouple from China. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1199.0s)]
*  OK, Congressman Ro Khanna slam for meeting Hindutva ideologue on India visit analyst A. Connors meeting shows that he doesn't want to alienate the Hindu Indian diaspora vote bank in the US. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1213.0s)]
*  India breaks starting off to a strong start. OK, dude, calm down. Like brick shit is is just leverage. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1223.0s)]
*  OK, it's weird because Pakistan also is operated by the Pakistan is in some ways also you could consider it like maybe not a vassal state, but close to a vassal state in terms of American interest, especially as intelligence community. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1231.0s)]
*  Like it's intelligence agency is is what dominates the country. So we have interest in both sides of this conflict, both parties in this conflict. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1252.0s)]
*  Obviously, with India, we have more I guess we have like the the manufacturing interests and they're very important to our trade agenda because. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1265.0s)]
*  Yeah, Pakistan is basically a friendly with both America and China. It's a holdover from the Kissinger days. Yeah, it's crazy because remember when I used to joke about how like, oh, America should just arm Hamas and then also Israel arm both sides and you come out on top. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1276.0s)]
*  Both sides are now buying your weapons. That's basically India versus Pakistan to some degree. You know what I mean? Like both sides are to a certain degree using our weapons against one another. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1290.0s)]
*  Another is fucking crazy unlimited money glitch unlocked. Masood Azhar, the man who brought jihad to Britain. This is the guy whose family died. His family got wiped out. Masood Azhar today heads one of Pakistan's most violent militant groups was once the VIP gets the Britain's leading Islamic scholars. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1304.0s)]
*  He's I don't know where he is, but I suspect that regardless of his like fundamentalist attitudes or whatever, you probably shouldn't be able to wipe out his entire family at a mosque considering that, you know, this is just his family. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1322.0s)]
*  There's children. That's insane. Like what, how do we, how do we decide that this is an appropriate military target? Like what is going on? This used to be a big fucking deal, man. This used to be a big fucking deal. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1340.0s)]
*  This used to be a big deal when America would flub a military operation because they killed like a bunch of family members. And now the metrics are all out of whack where it's like, yeah, you could strike a mosque, kill an entire family. It's good. You call them terrorists and move on. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1352.0s)]
*  What the fuck? Also, it's not just a Hindu to a fascist thing to be fair, because I feel like, I mean, I read a report from the communist party and they also authorized this, this, this military strike. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1367.0s)]
*  And I thought those guys were at least supposed to be a little bit more critical, even though Arun had told me that they were not. And they certainly, they certainly were not critical about this, this, this counter-terrorism military operation. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1380.0s)]
*  You know, don't get me started on CPI M. Yeah. We're going to have so many nine 11s and 10 years, man. Too many sites of blowback India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan administered Kashmir on Tuesday night. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1395.0s)]
*  Islam if I call the strikes, we already covered that China said they support Pakistan. Pakistan is their only escape. If they get besieged in the sea, the main reason the West is all over India is because they want to use India to fight China. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1406.0s)]
*  I think so too. If I'm going to look at it from a reductive perspective and like look at what America's interests are America is yeah. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1417.0s)]
*  Yeah. America is looking at the situation and, and looking at the instability in the region. And I assume thinking about this instability is not necessarily really that bad because it causes fear for China in its own backyard. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1428.0s)]
*  Long for any of the CPI M was throwing out people to the party for disagreeing with India committing war crimes against Tomills. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1446.0s)]
*  And killing of civilians. Now it is it has been escalating this tension between the two countries after the killing of the 26 people in Bhelgam on the 22nd of April. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1452.0s)]
*  And since then, the country here is is angry. They have been asking for some sort of revenge. And we've heard from Prime Minister Modi in several of his public statements saying that the perpetrators of that horrendous attack will be punished and their backers. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1465.0s)]
*  And they will be sought to the ends of the earth and they will be punished. And we've seen that happening in sort of the retaliation coming overnight in the Kashmir region. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1484.0s)]
*  The difference this time from the 2019 surgical strikes in Balakot in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, which India had conducted this time there has been a bit more not only in the Pakistan occupied Kashmir but also across the international border, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1496.0s)]
*  which makes it even more dangerous. Now, the attacks have taken place in sovereign Pakistan and therefore the sort of the toning up of this escalation is quite high. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1513.0s)]
*  We understand there's going to be a press briefing very soon by the Indian Defense Ministry with further details of this. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1529.0s)]
*  But at the moment, the tensions very high between the two countries. Just a few minutes ago, the foreign minister of India has put out a statement on X saying the world must show zero tolerance for terrorism. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1538.0s)]
*  And this is what India has been talking about. The terrorist launch pads and their sympathizers and terrorists will be brought to account. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1551.0s)]
*  Just received confirmed reports that India has attacked civilian targets, including the mosque and residential accommodation on five locations in Pakistan. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1558.0s)]
*  And as per the initial report chatters, they keep saying this is like Israel versus Gaza. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1571.0s)]
*  It's not. And this is not Israel versus Israel either. This is like Israel versus Iran, except Pakistan's involvement is is loosely identified even though there is historical reference to jihadist elements or Salafi elements like growing in [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1578.0s)]
*  and getting training inside of Pakistani borders as a direct consequence of America's interest in the region, specifically in Afghanistan and elsewhere. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1598.0s)]
*  But this would be closer to Israel versus Iran rather than Israel versus Israel or Israel versus Gaza. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1607.0s)]
*  Okay, so the in reductive terms, it's an infinitely more terrifying prospect considering that these are both nuclear powers. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1616.0s)]
*  Okay. It's not even Israel versus Iran because Iran has a more direct line for for logistics and training for all of the militancy against Israel and against the United States of America. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1628.0s)]
*  In the region as opposed to, yeah, Pakistan literally trained Islamist militants and killed the leftist movement in Kashmir. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1641.0s)]
*  That's where the Kashmir military groups are right wing fundamentalist. Yeah, it's an describing things to Americans. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1648.0s)]
*  Imagine the few countries, you know, yeah, don't worry. I'm going to start using I'm going to start using burger analogies in a second to okay. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1655.0s)]
*  Why would India do this? It's partially because from their perspective, okay, one, obviously they have a lot of smoke for Pakistan in general. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1663.0s)]
*  But from their perspective, they look at Pakistan as a unlimited training ground for separatist movements and fundamentalist movements that can get that can get involved in militancy and then sometimes engage in a kind of a [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1672.0s)]
*  India or as it happened this time around Indian administered Kashmir or in Kashmir specifically where there was there was a heinous heinous attack directly on, you know, tourists of Indian descent. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1688.0s)]
*  I can't explain it in burgers. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1700.0s)]
*  I can't put in the context of Israel or Iran here doesn't make sense. I don't know why people feel the need to constantly put things in the third world in terms of popular in the first world. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1703.0s)]
*  Well, that's how analogies work. You have to use an example that's like closer to people's understanding considering that are not necessarily the same. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1712.0s)]
*  There are casualties, including women and children. The detailed damage assessment is being done. And Pakistan has the right to respond. Pakistan will respond as I've said before. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1720.0s)]
*  We had an apprehension that India will attack Pakistan has never struck first, but we have the right to self defense and the way civilians have been targeted from what I understand is that Pakistan has been targeted by the [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1729.0s)]
*  Okay. But India is like, it doesn't matter if you condemn it or not. You're fucking training these guys. We demand blood. India moves on and actually strikes both in Pakistan administered Kashmir Pakistan controlled Kashmir territory. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1766.0s)]
*  And then also inside of Pakistan, which is a severe escalation and, and now Pakistan's like, well, what the fuck, what the fuck was that? Like you just, you just striking inside of Pakistan territory. Like that's, you know, ridiculous. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1782.0s)]
*  So now they will most likely also retaliate. India claims that their retaliation was actually restrained. Let's see what happens. If, if, you know, let's see what happens if Pakistan returns the favor in a similar in a similar measure. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1798.0s)]
*  And I have, you know, pictures and images of women and children who are badly injured in hospital. So civilian localities, accommodations and a mosque, which has been attacked. There were no terrorist camps. I myself took foreign journalists and local journalists to an area near the line of control where India had alleged that there are terrorist camps. You see, we are the frontline state against terrorists. How can we [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1814.0s)]
*  I'm just going to pick up on a, on a couple of points, Mr. Atolla, Tarrar. You said that you've already received. Nothing's going to happen. No, that's not what I said. I said, I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1842.0s)]
*  Images of women and children who have been injured. This attack took place roughly about an hour or so ago. Will you be taking international and local journalists to the sites? Because in the past, when, when Pakistan has made such claims, this interview has 4.3 million views in 18 hours. They haven't allowed any journalists. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1854.0s)]
*  I had planned to take them tomorrow morning. We had a plane ready. We had, we had reached out to journalists. We had a confirmed itinerary, a confirmed plan to go to Bahawalpur tomorrow. And I was supposed to fly to Bahawalpur at 7 a.m. in the morning. And at around right after midnight, India has carried out these attacks. So we were going to Muritke. We were going to Bahawalpur. And we were taking 35 journalists with us, including foreign and local journalists. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1877.0s)]
*  So I was just preparing for the visit tomorrow. As I visited the LOC, we were going to Bahawalpur and we had to visit this exact place. And the journalists were already ready for the journey. So I think this has been a very, very, I think, unfortunate step by India. We condemn it. We are responding. But to target civilian population, it's extremely unfortunate. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1907.0s)]
*  Just to point out, Minister, the Indian armed forces say that altogether nine sites have been targeted, that they haven't hit any Pakistani military facilities. These are terrorist camps that they are hitting. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1930.0s)]
*  Let me make it very clear. There are no terrorist camps in Pakistan. Pakistan is a victim of terrorism. We are fighting the terrorists in our Western regions, on our Western borders. We are the frontline state against terrorism. We've laid down 90,000 lives in this war against terrorism. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1947.0s)]
*  India, on the other hand, when we had the Jaffar Express hijacking, an intense hijacking incident, India did not even condemn it, let alone express some concern about that incident. So India has been sponsoring terrorism by assassinating Sikhs in the US, in Canada, in Australia. We captured a spy by the name of Kalbhushan Yadav, who is a commissioning naval officer. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1964.0s)]
*  Can I just point out to you, on my program, just a week ago, your defence minister, Hwaja Asif, admitted that Pakistan has for decades had a policy of funding, backing and using terrorist groups as proxies in the country. In fact, he cut military aid to Pakistan because he accused Pakistan of playing a double game. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=1985.0s)]
*  So when you say there are no terrorist camps in Pakistan, that is going against what General Paryaz Musharraf has said, what Benazir Bhutto has said, what your defence minister said just a week ago. In fact, what Bilawal Bhutto said to me a few days ago, he said that terrorism and funding and backing terrorist organisations has been and was part of Pakistan's history. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2010.0s)]
*  Post 9-11, let's talk about post 9-11 scenario. And let me be very clear, post 9-11, Pakistan was the frontline state and we still are the frontline state in eliminating terrorism. You see, when we are the guarantors of world peace because we are a wall between the terrorists and the rest of the world. You must, I would like to invite you to Pakistan to come and see the surface. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2034.0s)]
*  I have been to Pakistan, sir, and we know that Osama Bin Laden was also discovered in Abbottabad in Pakistan. So these accusations on Pakistan, including your defence minister making the admission, is there and that is why part of the reason. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2057.0s)]
*  I think what the defence minister was referring to, I think he's been misinterpreted. You see, there was a Soviet invasion back in the 80s and obviously we were countering the Soviet invasion at that point in time, that's part of history and we were allies of the US. So post 9-11, the scenario changed completely and Pakistan made a lot of sacrifices. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2072.0s)]
*  Pakistan is still laying down lives against terrorists. Even today in Balochistan, there was a terrorist attack. We lost seven soldiers. So you see Pakistani politicians, Pakistani soldiers, Pakistani officers, Pakistan. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2095.0s)]
*  The defence ministry has said they're ready for an all out war. Oh, as an Indian that agrees with the tag, what do you think in your eyes is the best way for India to handle this conflict? I don't know. I actually, I don't know, but it's definitely not escalation. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2108.0s)]
*  It revolves around de-escalation. It's always de-escalation. India is a huge supporter of Russia and buys Russian oil and buys majority of his weapons from Russia. No, I know India is in a very interesting place where it's a mediator for it's basically like a holdover state for as a Russian proxy is a holdover state for Russian goods to flow into and Russian energy to flow into the rest of the world. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2122.0s)]
*  And they're also simultaneously a very valuable nation state for manufacturing for Western interests, especially if Western interests as Donald Trump has stated is to remove ties. It's to remove ties from China is to remove the rest of the world and the global partnerships that have developed over the free trade agreements that have perpetuated in the past couple of decades to reverse their decisions. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2147.0s)]
*  And to move away from China, if you want to move away from China, you have to go to India. The ball isn't in India's core right now. It's in Pakistan's at the moment. As far as I know, Pakistan hasn't properly responded yet. And it seems like the Pakistan is absolutely vowed retaliation. Yeah. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2177.0s)]
*  I don't know enough about Pakistan military history. I don't know enough about Indian military history. Like this is not an area of my, this is not an area of expertise of mine. I'm the first to readily admit this. I mean, I know about militant trade. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2190.0s)]
*  I mean, I know about militant training inside of Pakistan. I know about separatist groups that India also trains as well. And I'm familiar with that stuff, but I don't know how restrained Pakistan will be. I don't know how restrained in like, I don't know what the accurate historical references that I can point to to say, this is how they've operated in the past. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2204.0s)]
*  This is how they will operate in the future to make these sorts of speculations. I don't know how the conflict could get resolved in this situation. Like people are talking about how Pakistan is already retaliated by breaching LOC and killing civilians in the Pune district. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2227.0s)]
*  I haven't seen the information coming out of that yet, but I suspect that that will not be considered the retaliation. I suspect the retaliation will be a similar airstrike. Like what India did, Pakistan will most likely do to the best of their ability to India, which is crazy, especially because these are, I'm going to stress the importance of this. These are both nuclear armed nations. Okay. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2241.0s)]
*  Learn the history on stream at a later date. No, I mean, I will definitely do more reading on this matter and and try to develop a better understanding of it, considering that this is obviously going to be a serious two weeks India had been. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2271.0s)]
*  This is obviously going to be a serious point of contention coming up. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2285.0s)]
*  Promising retaliation for a deadly attack on Indian civilians. When it came overnight, it was the largest series of airstrikes carried out in decades. Three people killed here in Muzzafarabad in Pakistani controlled Kashmir. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2290.0s)]
*  It's not like a, you hit me. So I hit you type situation either though, because India's argument in this situation is that the terror attack that took place in Kashmir, the, that was directly because of Pakistan. And as far as I understand, they have not shown. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2304.0s)]
*  They have not shown like any sort of direct evidence as to like the only evidence that they have in this interview as she's trying to draw out of this dude is that Pakistan has historically armed Mujahideen and they've they've admitted to that as well. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2321.0s)]
*  Like on this program on Sky News, former defense minister, I think he was a former defense minister, like openly admitted to it, but he was also talking specifically about America's interests and how this is like the, the arming and the funding and the training of fundamentalist groups was done at the behest of the United States of America. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2344.0s)]
*  And I don't know if he was trying to point to that last week or two weeks ago at this point to say, this is happening with the approval of the United States of America. Do you see what I'm saying? This was the very moment that took place. This was a major fucking major moment. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2367.0s)]
*  You do admit, sir, that that Pakistan has had a long history of backing and supporting and training and funding these terrorist organizations. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2384.0s)]
*  Well, we have been doing this dirty work for United States for about three decades, you know, and West, including Britain. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2394.0s)]
*  So, yeah, he, he says, he basically says like, we've been doing this, we've been doing this for you guys. So I don't know if he actually, I don't know if he, it's not that crazy to admit that it's first of all, total another vindication. Once again, if you recall, you know, for the blowback understanders, for the blowback enjoyers, blowback podcasts and blowback as a concept in general, this is what he is talking about. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2404.0s)]
*  Okay. It's just the truth. But as it pertains to this current situation, I don't know if he's saying that to just talk about the hypocrisy of the Western world, or if he's simply trying to point to the fact that this was not done. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2431.0s)]
*  This was, this was done with Western supervision, if that makes sense. Or if he's simply abdicating responsibility away from the hands of Pakistan to say, what do you expect was going to happen? You made us train these fundamentalist elements in the region. And now they're, you know, running rampant. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2449.0s)]
*  There's multiple different directions that he could be going with that revelation, right? Direction number one would be to imply that this was done with Western, with Western oversight. This attack was conducted not with Pakistani oversight and Pakistani directive, but instead with Western oversight. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2469.0s)]
*  Another direction this could, another, another thing he could be mentioning is, is that like the Western world made us train these people made us do their dirty work for decades. And now they're running rampant again to abdicate responsibility away from Pakistan in this regard. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2494.0s)]
*  Those are the two different directions that, that I suspect he was going with. There's there's China and what their interests are in terms of stability in the region. There's America and what their interests are in terms of stability in the region. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2517.0s)]
*  So I am, I am certainly confused as to where this will go, but here is drop site news. Pakistan claims to have shot down five and warplanes and one is really built reconnaissance drawn during retaliatory air combat. Three dissolved Rafale fighters. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2532.0s)]
*  One Sukhoi Su 30 MKI one Mikhaan MIG 29. One is really built. I AI Heron reconnaissance drone French intelligence sources have confirmed to CNN that at least one Rafale fighter jet was lost in combat. The officials added that France is still investigating the other possible losses of the advanced jet produced by French defense manufacturer. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2548.0s)]
*  Assault aviation during the fighting on May 6, India confirmed the three aircraft crash with an Indian territory and that three piles were injured, but has not confirmed all Pakistani claims, including drone loss. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2569.0s)]
*  Reckons of the French Mika air to air missile was found near Bethinda Air Force Station in India, indicating intense aerial combat. Pakistani defense minister, Kauaja Asif said that the country was preparing for an all out war on Wednesday, raising the possibility of nuclear escalation while adding that Islamabad still hoped to find an off ramp to the conflict with a new Delhi with new Delhi that began with a militant attack on civilians in the disputed region of Kashmir last month.

*  it looks a little different. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2653.0s)]
*  This is even scarier to some degree than like Ukraine, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2655.0s)]

*  they can implement against Russia, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2669.0s)]

*  and about 145 kilometers for the export variant used by Pakistan. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2732.0s)]

*  I think India just needed to send a strong message to their citizens, but I don't know. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2775.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it does make me feel like there is one party here [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2778.0s)]
*  that actively wants this to be... [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2782.0s)]
*  Modi took a popularity hit in the last election as we covered extensively. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2787.0s)]
*  And when you are an authoritarian strongman [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2793.0s)]
*  and your common enemy is Muslims inside of your own boundary [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2797.0s)]
*  and Muslims all around, and you are a Hindu to a fascist, a supremacist of sorts, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2802.0s)]
*  then yeah, making this or wanting to turn this into like, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2810.0s)]
*  this is what Pakistan did. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2817.0s)]
*  This is definitely Pakistan's doing. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2820.0s)]
*  We have to do everything in our power to hit back and hit back with major force. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2822.0s)]
*  It feels like that there is an escalation coming from one side as opposed to the other. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2828.0s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2834.0s)]
*  What's worse is there's unfortunately a lot of warmongering right now in India leading up to this. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2835.0s)]
*  And now there's warmongering out of Pakistan as well. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2838.0s)]
*  Indians are not understanding the implication of India attacking Baha Walpur or Sialkot at all. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2841.0s)]
*  Is Pakistan the main aggressor here? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2846.0s)]
*  Well, if you think that the fundamentalist groups that did this attack [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2848.0s)]
*  are directly operating under the Pakistani directive, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2853.0s)]
*  something that the Indian government has not presented enough verifiable evidence on thus far, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2857.0s)]
*  then this is Pakistan hitting first and then India striking back. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2863.0s)]
*  But so far, I don't think that that is confirmed. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2868.0s)]
*  Like the fact that they, the fact that they struck inside of the, it's like if Pakistan air struck the Taj Mahal [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2873.0s)]
*  and Agra, like the fact that they, they struck inside of, of Pakistan is an escalation for sure. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2885.0s)]
*  Like it moves the, it moves the conflict beyond like occupied Kashmir territory. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2892.0s)]
*  That is a, in my opinion, that is a severe escalation. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2900.0s)]
*  And this is the Pakistani defense minister responding to what they will do, vowing revenge. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2905.0s)]
*  At this point, I mean, is, is, is a, is, is a further conflict on the horizon. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2912.0s)]
*  Are you, are you concerned about a direct conflict, a war at this point? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2917.0s)]
*  Yeah, there is a, there is a possibility of this conflict, expansion of this conflict. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2922.0s)]
*  Hasan, you can't go to Houthi jihadists, Pakistani jihadists. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2930.0s)]
*  What, what is this guy fucking saying? Hasan, you know, now can't go to Houthi jihadists, Pakistani jihadists, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2934.0s)]
*  Gaza jihadists, where will the chiller there for jihadists next? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2941.0s)]
*  Dude, you can't even fucking write. You can't even write anything. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2944.0s)]
*  You just got so horny to be like jihadists in, in Gaza jihadists. Yeah. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2949.0s)]
*  Houthi jihadists and Gaza jihadists. That's right. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2956.0s)]
*  I think into a full, which we are trying to avoid. But last night they crossed the international boundary in boundary, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2959.0s)]
*  international boundary and control line. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2971.0s)]
*  Like calling Zaydi Shias and a nationalist emancipatory movement and a nationalist emancipatory militancy jihadists is so funny because you basically are [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2973.0s)]
*  openly recognizing openly admitting that your position is they're just Muslim. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2986.0s)]
*  That's it. There are no differences between Muslim groups. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2990.0s)]
*  The entire Pakistani nation is also Muslim and therefore jihadist. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2993.0s)]
*  Everyone is a jihadist. Like it's, it's basically a more appropriate, but still very racist substitute for calling them sand and words or something. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=2999.0s)]
*  You know, it's insane. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3008.0s)]
*  So the other two are, you know, they involve, they involve dispute with countries, but crossing the international boundary. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3010.0s)]
*  This is the clear cut violation and invitation to, to expand the conflict, you know, and maybe, you know, convert it into something much more wider. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3020.0s)]
*  So for the record, also, this isn't like a good dude either. Okay. I'm not like, I'm not going to sit here and be like the, the Pakistan position here is, is the appropriate one. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3033.0s)]
*  Correct one. I'm not saying that either before people freak the fuck out. It's just that India has escalated. That is just a fact. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3046.0s)]
*  India escalated and brought the conflict into Pakistan borders beyond occupied Kashmir territory. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3055.0s)]
*  And in doing so severely escalated this conflict. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3065.0s)]
*  And they did it without revealing any, as far as I've seen, and I might, I might be wrong, but I don't know if they have like verifiable. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3069.0s)]
*  Confirmed evidence as to a direct involvement from Pakistan beyond saying, well, these guys train inside of Pakistan's boundaries and that Pakistan lets these dudes loose on Indian territory. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3081.0s)]
*  Does that make sense of the nine Indian air strikes conducted in Pakistan earlier today? Eight targets were revealed in India's official press release. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3096.0s)]
*  These locations have simply spin geo located a map, the visual providing an insight into the cross border operation. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3102.0s)]
*  As I'm saying India is right to based. Well, that's not surprising. India just started investigating after attack in Pakistan and I, a, the national investigation agency of India appeals to people to share information on the polomar terror attack releases phone numbers. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3108.0s)]
*  The fuck bro, you're supposed to do this. You are a terrorist for supporting Pakistan. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3126.0s)]
*  I feel like you're supposed to do this before you decide to, you are clearly one siding this. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3131.0s)]
*  You are not acknowledging the fact that Pakistan has harbor terrorists for years in this attack on those camps. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3138.0s)]
*  No, I'm not. I'm not saying that that isn't happening at all. What are you talking about? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3142.0s)]
*  That's the only thing I do know about the history of Pakistan is specifically that what you're talking about, what you claim to, what you, what you act like. I am not acknowledging. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3147.0s)]
*  I am acknowledging that that's some of the few things that I do know about the history of Pakistan is specifically that because of my interest in Pakistan being almost entirely about American involvement in Pakistan. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3159.0s)]
*  That's that's some of the few things that I know about Pakistan is that his chat is shitting on both sides because both are brown. I've seen some saying a lot of Akbar when Indians are on screen. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3172.0s)]
*  I feel like that's going to be an interesting take. That's going to be an interesting takeaway from, from a group of individuals that don't know anything and haven't really and don't really care to understand it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3183.0s)]
*  And they're just like, lol, but we hate both sides. I guess we'll fall on the side where, you know, whoever's against the Muslims, I guess we hate less. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3197.0s)]
*  India said it was targeting terror camps. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3206.0s)]
*  They attacked innocent unarmed civilians. There is no truth to their claims. There were no such activities here. We live here. We've never seen anything like that. They just did this to spread fear and assert their aggression. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3211.0s)]
*  India says it hit nine terror related targets that it showed restraint by avoiding military and civilian sites. But Indian missiles struck deep into Pakistan itself. Well beyond Pakistani controlled Kashmir. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3226.0s)]
*  This was Bahawalpur, where India said it hit a compound belonging to the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Another destroyed mosque in Muridka, where India said it struck the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba, another group fighting Indian control in Kashmir. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3239.0s)]
*  These actions were measured, non-ascalatory, proportionate and responsible. They focused on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists likely to be sent across to bombing a religious site. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3255.0s)]
*  India first days in same brother. India does that inside of its own borders too. So that's not, let me tell you something. Okay. That's not, that's a favorite classic for Modi. So it's like, you can't really, that's a thing he's going to do to India. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3270.0s)]
*  India has done that to its own Muslim population inside of its own borders. So it's not shocking to me that they would do so in Pakistan as well. So, you know, at least I know about that. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3286.0s)]
*  In place today after the strikes in Pakistan's Punjab, the hot land of its powerful military, India has delivered a blow to which Pakistan is promising a commensurate response at a time and of a means it says of its choosing. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3304.0s)]
*  At the same time, it is already claiming a win saying Pakistani planes shot down five Indian military jets inside their own airspace. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3318.0s)]
*  The Pakistan Air Force was on full alert and our jets did not cross the borders of Pakistan. As soon as the Indian planes released their payloads, suddenly our Air Force pilots swooped down on them and shot five of their planes, including three Rafale jets, and they fell in Indian controlled Kashmir. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3327.0s)]
*  The two armies also exchanged artillery fire across the line of control in Kashmir, as many as 13 Indian civilians reported killed, along with at least six people on the Pakistani side of the de facto border. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3347.0s)]
*  This major escalation in a decades long conflict, catalyzed by the gun attack last month that killed 25 Indians and one Nepali national at a beauty spot in Indian administered Kashmir. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3360.0s)]
*  India's right wing nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi shown in muted images addressing his cabinet today. Here's the task steering this nation through the most serious escalation. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3372.0s)]
*  Bros, I'm Hindu for YouTubers is going to be obsessed with you now. God damn it. I'm sorry. India. Number one. Please don't come after me. Please. India. Number one. Not even no one else is even number two. It's number one. Please. Please. Oh my God. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3383.0s)]
*  I'm going to get fucking I'm collecting enemies from virtually every country and and every group of right wing literally everywhere around the planet. You know, I'm just catching smoke globally in years with its rival nuclear power. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3398.0s)]
*  Mirror images in Islamabad Shabazz Sharif with his grim faced national security team, both India and Pakistan fielding international calls for restraint and de-escalation. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3419.0s)]
*  Both sides also aware of the domestic demand for action and strength. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3431.0s)]
*  I wonder if they'll post this and be like, this is anti-Indian racism. They'll be like, these guys are engaging in heinous anti-Indian racism to hit the Israel line. You know what I mean? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3439.0s)]
*  Protesters in Karachi today calling for retaliation against India. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3450.0s)]
*  You don't understand the numbers. You think Americans are dumb. Think three times the population and the Indians will come after you. No, I know. I know. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3454.0s)]
*  And across India, civil defense drills in preparation for a possible attack. The likelihood is that a further Pakistani response would be against Indian military targets. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3463.0s)]
*  The task for both countries now, delicate calibration of blunt military might enough for deterrence and national pride, stopping short of full scale war. The region entering a period of genuine jeopardy. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3474.0s)]
*  Well, earlier I spoke to Tuhin Sinha, spokesman for the BJP, that's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party, and I asked what he thought India's strikes had achieved. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3489.0s)]
*  Well, ideally, it was the responsibility of Pakistan to take the kind of action that we did. It's a shame. Pakistan today is a global embarrassment. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3498.0s)]
*  The fact that we had to enter another country and act against terrorists who had been given a free run shows that Pakistan was complicit in encouraging these terror activities, and which is a point we have made, we have consistently been making to the entire world. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3508.0s)]
*  Don't you think India needs to provide the evidence that the Pakistan government was complicit, which it hasn't provided yet in the last two weeks? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3522.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter from three decades, from the last three decades. This is not the only attack which has been, which has been sponsored by Pakistan 2008. There was direct complicity. What did Pakistan do? Did Pakistan even try to address the issues we had raised? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3533.0s)]
*  Yes, but do you think evidence needs to be provided? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3547.0s)]
*  We have given it doesn't matter is crazy. Like, I'm sorry. You have not provided evidence for the complicity of the Pakistani government and his responses. It doesn't matter. That is insane. Please chatters. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3551.0s)]
*  Maybe is it an ESL thing? First of all, no, he is very competent with the English language. What are you talking about? Okay. Like, no, he is actively going. Nah, don't care. There's plenty of evidence. There's plenty of evidence in my mind. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3572.0s)]
*  And that's it. It is also shocking that the ruling, the ruling party's attitude to crossing a severe boundary. Welcome to Indian. Welcome to India. Hassan, our politics is somehow more cooked than Turkey's politics. That is a, that is an incredible thing to just openly admit in the Western media too. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3591.0s)]
*  Like this shit probably plays well on like the Indian version of Fox news. You can be paying for blood like this, but going on, like you're not Israel. Okay. I need to explain something to you. BJP. You are not Israel. You don't have a sophisticated network of propaganda and NGOs that you have designed after looking at the failures of the South African apartheid and, and, and have created a lot of trouble. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3612.0s)]
*  You have created like this incredible propaganda machine in an effort to basically go on and say, of course you're going to give us all the weapons and all the money. And we're going to terrorists because, you know, it is what it is. We're fighting a war against evil here. You don't get to do that. You can't do that here. I'll give you a great example. Okay. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3642.0s)]
*  Israel in the, in the United States of America, Israeli groups are not considered. They're not, they don't have to register as foreign agents. Okay. Pro Israel groups do not register as foreign agents. Whereas pro Indian groups are registered as foreign agents. That distinction should be very clarifying. That distinction in of itself should be incredibly revealing. If you think that you can get away with saying stuff like this in the Western world. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3663.0s)]
*  You can't, but I don't know. Maybe the appetite that people have, maybe the appetite that people have for death and destruction, where the, the receiving end of the, of the militancy or the receiving end of, of violent acts and severe escalations is Muslim. So maybe they'll go along with it. I don't know. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3693.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3713.0s)]
*  I did yet in the last two weeks. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3714.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter from three decades from the last three decades. This is it doesn't matter. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3716.0s)]
*  The only attack which has been, which has been sponsored by Pakistan 2008. There was direct complicity. What did Pakistan do? Did Pakistan even try to address the issues? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3721.0s)]
*  I think India is so big and, and has been around for so long and has his own internal cast dynamics and whatnot that they sometimes forget that like the way they see themselves in India is not reflective of the way that white supremacists see Indians in the Western world. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3731.0s)]
*  It's not dissimilar to the way Turks operate where they're like, we're above these fucking Arabs. You know, like if you, I know this is a Turkish man. Let me tell you Turks think that they have a Turkic supremacist attitude. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3752.0s)]
*  They will get very mad when, when, when someone in the Western world says like you're Arab. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3765.0s)]
*  Okay. But in the eyes of the Western world broadly, they do think you're no different than Arabs. They think you're Muslim. You're the same kind of person. What the fuck are you talking about? You're scary. Why are you talking to me? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3771.0s)]
*  And it's the same thing with, with Indians doing propaganda in the Western world where I think they are the white guys in their own country because, you know, I don't mean like literally white in the way that you look at someone and the color of their skin. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3785.0s)]
*  I'm saying like they are the dominant group in their own country. So they come into the Western world and think like, yeah, what are you talking about? Like, of course we're going to do this shit. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3801.0s)]
*  Most of the white national accounts are legit run by Indians Lamont. I know that's not, that's why it's so funny when you got all of the like defend Western civilization accounts. Now talking about how Pakistan must be. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3813.0s)]
*  We must defeat Pakistan guys with accounts, guys with accounts like with the, with the fucking white statue in the PFP posting suspiciously a lot about how Pakistan must be nuked to defend England. I guess Greek statue PFPs really locked in on this conflict. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3825.0s)]
*  And not from the perspective of the likes of Asmongold, for example, you know what I mean? Cause that would be like Asmongold perspective on this would be like the normal average white guy who doesn't give a shit because they're both Brown where it's like, yeah, blow each other up. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3847.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. Who cares? Brahmin and North Indian songies think they're descendants of the Aryan race. This literally happened on primetime Indian Fox one news network. This happens all the time. Brahmin and North Indian songies think they're descendants of the Aryan race. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3860.0s)]
*  That's why the constantly attached themselves to white supremacy this way. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3874.0s)]
*  Yes. But do you think evidence needs to be provided? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3877.0s)]
*  We have given up team dosiers to Pakistan. In fact, you know, between 2004 to 2008, there was a time when almost on an average, every 35, 40 days, there would be a big terror attack at India through bomb blast. Every time we would provide [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3879.0s)]
*  slowly starting to feel every non-white national account is just an Indian Hindu cosplaying is his greatest fantasy. Every person in every nation will celebrate their nation's victory except Abdul from India. Hindu is one of the international cricket tournament hosted by Islamic nation during the holy month of [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3895.0s)]
*  Ramadan. Who host Pakistan? Who lost New Zealand? Who's crying? Radiant Christian Zionist justice crusader really dialed in on the latest and greatest of Indian racism technology. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3909.0s)]
*  Hmm. It's just as wild. All right. Let's keep going. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3925.0s)]
*  Dossier. They would not act on it. You know, this unit to understand this is a different country. This is a new India. It would not tolerate terror activities across the border. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3934.0s)]
*  Hey, it's on top donor here. Got in touch with tiltify about the anonymization of my donation name plus comment. They confirmed that the name and comment was moderated by the charity itself. It is what it is. All good. Thanks for reading my comment to your audience and humanizing [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3944.0s)]
*  our people in Gaza such as my aunt. She was one of the many millions of direct and indirect casualties due to Israel's criminal blockade. Keep doing what you're doing. Yeah. Thank you for being so understanding about this. I think part of the reason why they're also anonymizing the donations is because [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3954.0s)]
*  as far as I understand, Ethan's community has created a spreadsheet of every single donation that they're tracking so that they can try and find who they are and docs them. Not sure how they would even do that. Not sure how they would even get that information. But yeah, yeah. It's [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3970.0s)]
*  It's a they're manually adding each name per person. Yeah. Some in each through community are also suggesting what someone on kiwi farms mentioned an old charity stream some right wing creator do with the donations ended up all being returned because people were donating 1488 and fucked up stuff for their names. It would genuinely be sad if a charity had to give back the money because of that kind of thing. But I would laugh my ass off at snark to be honest. What an what an incredibly unhinged thing. What an incredibly unhinged thing to point to. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=3992.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Evens community doing canary mission shit. Not Zion is by the way. I know why they have to give the donations back. Yeah. Because if they were doing like racist donations then yeah it would be the sex pest any fans but they're flaring that so was he look liner to identify each other. Okay. I don't know about all that. This one hundred and eighty six thousand follower count is also Indian. I'm 99% sure lots of there's a lot of Hindu pose. Who would you want to win the war. I don't know about the healer Kleiner thing. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4021.0s)]
*  But anyway whether there is concrete evidence as of now or not of the particular attack in Bailgam factors that over the last three decades Pakistan has not acted acted on the numerous occasions we provided them multiple doziers with evidence. When do you think India will actually act on the when will it start trying to cut that water off. Well you know work on that has already begun. You know there are four new hydropower. There are four new dams which have been commissioned. You know to to [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4051.0s)]
*  arrest the flow of water to Pakistan. But these things are some you know I mean we would not be providing every details on public platform. You know because there has to be an element of surprise. There has to be an element of speculation. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4081.0s)]
*  Oh the guy that posted that the guy that posted that also is a destiny poster. Nice classic shocking. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4096.28s)]
*  They should in these activities. What do you mean. In the past we would have seen the Americans urging restraint and the Brits as well. What are what are your allies saying to India about possible escalation here. We want partners at this point of time. We're not looking for preachers. The U.S. is with us for sure. You know they may or not may not act in a certain manner or may not put certain words in a message. But we know for a fact that U.S. is with us. They have a very firm anti [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4103.28s)]
*  terror stand and therefore for you know Pakistan does not get the same support from Islamic countries which it used to get at one point of time. But it does have support from China. Well China has been restrained. I won't hide the fact that China we don't have. There is a trust deficit between India and China. But again China has been pretty restrained. China is not openly supported Pakistan. To in somehow. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you. Well I'm joined now by Hina Rabbani Khar a former Pakistani foreign affairs minister who [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4133.28s)]
*  pushed for closer ties with India. And if you were in government now would you be arguing for retaliation or for de-escalation. God if I could only contextualize what has happened in our region because of the impunity that has been provided to a [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4163.28s)]
*  So this is the India that we're talking about. We're hyper nationalism and electoralism. And we're talking about the [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4178.96s)]
*  So this is the India that we're talking about. We're hyper nationalism and electoral gains has allowed them not once back in 2019. And even before that I think it all started when I first started calling the world's attention to India becoming a rogue state when they decided to do away the Security Council resolutions and re annexed Kashmir occupied Kashmir at will and saying now this is India's territory and no one no one could challenge them on that. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4203.8s)]
*  So this is the India that started this round of violence wasn't it. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4233.8s)]
*  Look absolutely let's start with that. And you know how many attacks there have been on Pakistanis in Balochistan which we have evidence that we have shared with the UN unlike India which decide to say it has no need to share any evidence as this spokesperson of the of that Hindutva party which is dividing India which is dividing the region and the world to be honest said to you in your own program that they have no need to because there's such impunity that they have no need to. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4236.2s)]
*  All they have to do is make an accusation and then strike go against international borders for go international law humanitarian law go and attacks. It has the right to so you sitting in the United in the United Kingdom right now. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4260.68s)]
*  Tomorrow has part of these groups to prosper in Pakistan. Why does it not take action against them. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4272.08s)]
*  You are you are making a supposition over here and you are assuming that Pakistan has not taking action against terrorist groups when we have lost both civilians and military at higher number than frankly speaking any other country to report to terrorist action and to try and protect a country from terrorists. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4278.12s)]
*  We have repeatedly said to India that terrorism wouldn't this be like if if Pakistan held India accountable for like Balochistan separatist movements and then struck directly into India. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4293.84s)]
*  Like I feel like isn't that isn't that what would it would look like like if they directly struck inside of India to be like well there was a there was active terror from Balochistan separatists India. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4309.92s)]
*  No they hold India responsible for Balochistan separatist movements. Yes and just like there is validity to the claims that India is making in terms of like a lot some of these Salafist movements some of the some of the some of the fundamentalist movements are getting training inside of Pakistani borders. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4322.08s)]
*  From what I understand there's also evidence to suggest that they are getting Balochistan separatists are also Balochistan separatists are also in a similar situation within Indian boundaries. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4339.84s)]
*  The point I'm trying to make is that Pakistan has not struck back into Indian territory in the aftermath of like an attack or something like they hold. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4354.400000000001s)]
*  They hold India responsible. India holds Pakistan responsible. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4364.88s)]
*  It's not you know I'm not saying that like Pakistan is a country that is not engaging in its own version of what India is doing. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4369.28s)]
*  Yeah Pakistan aren't entirely small being country either but Pakistan attacking Agra or Luthiana for Balochistan is insane. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4378.16s)]
*  Yeah like it would be akin to it would be akin to Pakistan directly striking inside of Indian territory by claiming well Balochistan separatists are actually being trained and armed inside of your boundaries. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4385.0s)]
*  So tit for tat. How much do you think India being a manufacturing hub plays into when it comes to EU looking the other way when it comes to India's human rights violations. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4397.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4406.6s)]
*  It's a common problem. It's a regional problem. It's an international problem. We need to put forces together for sane elements to come together to be able to deal with rogue elements. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4407.88s)]
*  But when the state decides to use whatever is at its disposal to become a rogue state a state itself becomes a terrorist state then where do you go other than the United Nations. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4418.04s)]
*  So I'll even you now in favor. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4428.0s)]
*  The maximum support Balochistan is getting from India is some couple of millions of dollars. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4429.92s)]
*  Now does India send its active trained fighters from India to Pakistan to attack Pakistani civilians. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4433.2s)]
*  You'd be making a mistake to think that. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4436.92s)]
*  I mean you know you you carried out these talks with India after the Mumbai attacks. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4438.6s)]
*  Do you know. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4443.8s)]
*  I call myself an indefatigable optimist in Pakistan vis a vis India because I looked at myself as a citizen of the region a citizen of the world and saw that entire poverty in the subcontinent. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4445.84s)]
*  And everything that we had done was not answer of prosperity but the other way around. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4459.639999999999s)]
*  We in when I was foreign minister the Pakistan People's Party government decided to start trade negotiations with India to really move away because I believed I was a generation which was post 1971 which and there was no question of wars again. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4463.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4477.5199999999995s)]
*  But should Pakistan. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4477.679999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately I mean let's come back to my very first question. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4478.759999999999s)]
*  Should I should they return to should they step back. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4482.92s)]
*  So should Pakistan wait. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4486.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah that chatter. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4488.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean look I don't know. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4489.400000000001s)]
*  I mean cursory analysis here but solid bits of evidence provide proving that India supports terrorist forces in some Pakistani areas like Balochistan province providing them with money weapons and training some sources close to the matter told the Global Times. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4491.64s)]
*  While continually suppressing some of his rivals and neighbors in the international community with the excuse of anti-terrorism India secretly funded terrorist forces in Pakistan. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4505.040000000001s)]
*  In various parts of the South Asian countries such as the separatist played plague Balochistan inciting local secessionists to undermine regional stability through terrorist attacks they revealed. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4512.64s)]
*  Obviously this is a very biased article by the way through looking into historical materials related to news reports from both Pakistani and Indian media sources. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4520.360000000001s)]
*  The Global Times found that India has a long history of bagging terrorism in Pakistan and his involvement in destabilizing Pakistan as a matter of serious concern. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4528.96s)]
*  The case of Kulb Hussan Jadhav serving Indian naval officers clear evidence of state-sponsored terrorism is averse of activities. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4535.92s)]
*  By the way this isn't to say I need you to understand something. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4544.36s)]
*  This isn't the fucking say that you know Pakistan has a right to one rip through the Balochistan separatist movement and then simultaneously strike India. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4547.68s)]
*  I'm not saying that at all. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4557.8s)]
*  What I'm simply stating is if you're looking at state actors on both sides of this conflict one state actor has increased has escalated to a degree where Pakistan has not. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4559.36s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. It would be it would be akin to Pakistan saying well there's evidence that you have offered direct training to Balochistan separatists. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4571.92s)]
*  So we're going to we're going to strike Indian targets. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4581.84s)]
*  Again it's very similar to Kashmir in that the legit grievances of the Baloch against Pakistan are buried in the broader rhetoric of Pakistan versus India. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4585.44s)]
*  Baloch have a legitimate grievances with Pakistan and Kashmir is with India. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4592.36s)]
*  Their voices are silenced in the broader geopolitical theater that India and Pakistan are playing. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4595.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4599.08s)]
*  For India to make a next claim at will it will ever parts of Pakistan inside Pakistan's sovereign territory to make claims unsubstantiated. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4600.24s)]
*  I guess this is to say why don't you give screen time the Pakistan terrorists where the past terrorists live training were born brother. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4611.6s)]
*  First of all wait what has never strived for democracy India like every other democracy has ups and downs but there's a whole entire midnight between India and Pakistan. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4617.84s)]
*  She is so full of trash but they don't have camps in India. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4625.92s)]
*  Ironically the camps are still in Pakistan. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4628.240000000001s)]
*  I get this isn't to say why don't you give screen time the Pakistan terrorists. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4630.0s)]
*  Where do the past terrorists live train and were born. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4632.88s)]
*  What did she say that was like dub. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4635.120000000001s)]
*  It's unsubstantiated claims and claims that they feel they have no right or no responsibility to give evidence not only to Pakistan but even to the international community because the BJP J. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4638.72s)]
*  Shankar and Prime Minister Modi cannot take responsibility for the internal security which is a result of political engineering that they have done in Kashmir in front of the world. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4649.28s)]
*  If they cannot take responsibility if they want to outsource all the security problems on Pakistan's name. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4661.32s)]
*  She called India a terrorist rogue state. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4667.04s)]
*  Yeah I don't think that that is fucked up to say what are you talking about. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4669.08s)]
*  Yeah it is. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4674.04s)]
*  What are we talking about. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4675.56s)]
*  So is this real. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4676.64s)]
*  So was America any state that struck violates the sovereignty of another nation state. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4677.4800000000005s)]
*  So was Russia a great example of this would be Russia any state that violates the sovereignty of another state and strikes civilian targets is a fucking rogue terrorist state. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4684.68s)]
*  She didn't even say India is a terrorist rogue state. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4696.84s)]
*  I think she just said India is a rogue state but I would go so far as to say yeah they're doing terrorism. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4698.96s)]
*  Also her analysis on the matter is is putting the BJP guy in a very different light like her. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4704.320000000001s)]
*  She's coming across a way more restrained and way more informed instead of just simply saying I don't give a shit that there's no evidence no direct ties to Pakistan involvement. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4712.64s)]
*  In the in the terror attack that took place who gives a fuck. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4725.68s)]
*  They've been doing this for 30 years. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4728.0s)]
*  We have to get blood. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4729.280000000001s)]
*  Seems a little crazy to say especially when you're trying to defend your position in the Western world by presenting yourself as like a reasonable restrained sovereign nation state. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4731.360000000001s)]
*  And then attack at will and kill civilians women children send them to hospitals in large. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4743.84s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm vehemently anti Modi and his agenda with the call India rogue terrorist state is absolutely incorrect. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4751.76s)]
*  I mean this severe escalation that violates all this is a rogue terrorist action a rogue terrorist state action. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4756.320000000001s)]
*  That's precisely what it what that was what happened like just like what Russia has done in Ukraine makes it a rogue terrorist state. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4764.4800000000005s)]
*  Tens of numbers which state would you recommend to lie quietly and wait for the next attack to come. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4773.92s)]
*  He's a nationalist in the tour India state terrorist. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4780.6s)]
*  We think I don't think you guys understand like like what this is doing to previous international considerations that were basically held together by ticker tape. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4787.4400000000005s)]
*  OK held together by wishes and a fucking promise that two states especially with nuclear arms are not supposed to directly engage in conflict with one another without like the go ahead of either sovereign nation. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4802.08s)]
*  Like there's a reason why countries engage in deconfliction even when they're actually fighting against one another like America and Russia communicate flight flight paths. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4816.76s)]
*  You understand that these are foreign adversaries that communicate flight paths with one another. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4827.56s)]
*  Why do they do that. Why do they do that. Have you ever wondered why they do that. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4832.88s)]
*  It's so that this what is happening right now does not fucking happen. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4838.8s)]
*  And the very fact that even if you have direct evidence even if you have direct evidence of Pakistan involvement. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4842.84s)]
*  OK the Pakistan government's involvement and protection. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4850.16s)]
*  You still have to be restrained when dealing when dealing with these sorts of affairs especially when you're talking about another nuclear armed state. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4853.320000000001s)]
*  If there's any proof that they directly targeted civilian locations and harm civilians I would agree with you so far I have not seen evidence. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4863.96s)]
*  What what do you mean. We just looked at this article. What are you talking about. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4869.92s)]
*  Militant group chief says relatives killed an India strike. They hit a mosque chatter. They killed children in a mosque. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4873.5199999999995s)]
*  The fuck. And that's that's completely insane to do that. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4879.759999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. So how has it all come to this. And is there any player on the global stage who can step in to encourage the two sides to move towards a peaceful resolution. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4885.08s)]
*  India and Pakistan had only been independent for months when they fought their first war over the fate of Kashmir in 1947. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4896.240000000001s)]
*  Thousands died chatters he immediately said OK my bad I hadn't seen that. OK it's fine. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4903.8s)]
*  Like he just didn't see it before a UN broke it ceasefire. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4909.96s)]
*  Muslims count on others restrained so they can take advantage of others' reasonability just like China and their blatant theft of intellectual property and processes. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4913.96s)]
*  And using others to own court systems against them while foreigners lose all legal action in China. Yeah China the Muslim nation Muslims love it when others are restrained so they can take advantage of others' reasonability. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4921.6s)]
*  Yeah Muslims love taking advantage of the restraint that America demonstrated after 9 11 where it went on a complete destabilizing mission. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4932.52s)]
*  Tens of millions of people displaced millions of people killed directly through war in countries that were not even remotely involved with 9 11. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4946.84s)]
*  Ironically enough in an effort to hunt down the people that we had trained in the past sometimes inside of Pakistan. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4958.08s)]
*  Ironically enough. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4966.28s)]
*  Wow so much restraint so much restraint when I think about the way that the Western world treats Muslim nations restraint is not the first word that comes to mind. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4968.56s)]
*  But then also I doubly find it hilarious that you said just like China the Muslim nation of China you can't even shake this guy. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4979.4400000000005s)]
*  And yet Western nations still accept them in their own countries in our own lands. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4990.32s)]
*  What does this have to do with American forum these people think their own state's designation of terrorists applied and withdrawn whimsically are the end all be all of who's a terrorist and who isn't there's a subjective designation by your state and then there's actual definition of terrorism objectively applied globally. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=4994.5199999999995s)]
*  Most countries the pinnacles of power engage in terrorism frequently and capriciously. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5008.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5011.719999999999s)]
*  Left the majority. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5012.84s)]
*  So you admit that Pakistan is a training home for terrorism. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5013.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5016.12s)]
*  And for the record so is India to a certain degree. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5016.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5020.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5021.16s)]
*  Pakistan has been historically a training hub for terrorism. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5022.88s)]
*  Literally. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5026.84s)]
*  What why is this news to you. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5028.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5030.08s)]
*  Who who who for whose interest is the question you must ask for whose interest was Pakistan a training ground for terrorism. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5030.92s)]
*  I wonder I wonder who played a formative role in this happening. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5041.36s)]
*  The thing that pisses me off is that India and Pakistan were essentially countries entirely whole cloth manufactured by the elites both of Muslim and upper caste Hindu background. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5046.5599999999995s)]
*  If you actually look at who was in the Muslim League in Congress is entirely upper caste Muslims and Hindus the dichotomy between Pakistan and India is entirely fake. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5053.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5061.2s)]
*  RSS is a terrorist group in India dude. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5061.44s)]
*  What are you talking about. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5064.12s)]
*  And they are significantly they have significantly more influence. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5065.36s)]
*  And prominence within India than fucking ascetic jihadist or salafist groups do in Pakistan. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5070.639999999999s)]
*  This is again not even a defense of Pakistan. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5077.2s)]
*  I am perfectly cognizant and also very aware of of the the training grounds and the madrasas that existed inside of Pakistan. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5080.599999999999s)]
*  Who who benefited from that. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5092.839999999999s)]
*  I wonder. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5095.0s)]
*  To Muslim region divided with the promise of a vote to allow Kashmiris to have a say in their future. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5096.08s)]
*  But that never happened. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5102.04s)]
*  In the wake of a second war in 1965 came the establishment of a de facto border known as the Line of Control a heavily fortified stretch of military outposts. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5103.56s)]
*  There have been several flare ups since with cross border fire. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5114.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm gonna give you guys whiplash after this is done by the way. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5117.400000000001s)]
*  Doors open. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5120.96s)]
*  I'm gonna give you guys severe whiplash when we move away from this and have like a brief moment of solace where we do a drip check and fit check and Met Gala responses only to go back to this in a little bit. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5122.08s)]
*  OK. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5134.04s)]
*  Because wisdom and frugal aesthetic are here right now. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5134.48s)]
*  And in 1999 fighting in the Cargill district lasting 10 weeks was brought to an end by US mediation between the now nuclear armed nations. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5137.16s)]
*  We're going to cover you. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5147.44s)]
*  I'm doing after the 9 11 attacks the United States relationship with Pakistan became vital to its war on terror. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5148.599999999999s)]
*  But America's withdrawal from Afghanistan saw it drop Pakistan as a strategic partner. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5156.639999999999s)]
*  Now America is much closer to India seeing it as a vital partner in containing Chinese power in Asia. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5162.2s)]
*  I think the other big shift in the region is that China and Pakistan have also moved much more close together. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5169.16s)]
*  China has sold Pakistan very advanced military equipment and although China isn't necessarily willing to protect Pakistan from attack I think it is willing to give Pakistan diplomatic cover in places like the United Nations. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5175.04s)]
*  Normally the world would expect America to try to mediate again but Donald Trump is not obviously engaged with the matter. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5190.16s)]
*  Yesterday he claimed the two countries who only existed since 1947 have been fighting for hundreds of years. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5197.2s)]
*  Well here with me is Alexander Evans who served as deputy and acting high commissioner in both India and Pakistan. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5205.68s)]
*  He's now a professor at the London School of Economics. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5211.68s)]
*  Well we've heard both sides and pretty belligerent they are. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5214.28s)]
*  Let's start with the initial claim. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5217.360000000001s)]
*  Could that first attack in Indian administered Kashmir have happened without Pakistani complicity or knowledge. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5218.52s)]
*  Could that attack have happened without the infrastructure that supports terrorist groups. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5226.84s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5230.88s)]
*  Do we know enough yet to know the precise details of attribution as to who is responsible and what the details were. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5232.28s)]
*  Probably not yet. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5238.76s)]
*  Do you think we'll get the evidence. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5240.16s)]
*  We may and I think different governments India will have evidence Pakistan will have evidence other countries will have evidence. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5242.360000000001s)]
*  The question is what will be released publicly I think particularly in this battle for information that we're already seeing taking place. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5248.76s)]
*  And we heard Pakistan's counterclaim that India supports Balochistan militants in Pakistan. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5255.92s)]
*  Is that likely also to be true. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5262.36s)]
*  I think what you get is allegations on both sides. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5264.88s)]
*  The challenge here is discerning what is accurate from what is not. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5267.72s)]
*  What we do know is that a large group of tourists were gunned down in Kashmir and that has triggered the most serious crisis between India and Pakistan. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5271.6s)]
*  But we've seen for I would argue well over a decade. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5280.24s)]
*  Right. Is there any external player that's relevant here or is this a bilateral question that they need to work out themselves. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5283.24s)]
*  The ultimate decisions I think Delhi these are two sovereign nations that proud nations and they'll make decisions that they see in their own national interests. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5290.76s)]
*  The interesting question is how much Islamabad may listen to Beijing given the proximity of Pakistan and China. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5299.08s)]
*  And China has played a discreet and quiet role in crises past. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5306.92s)]
*  But what you're seeing is a chorus of different states engaged encouraging de-escalation. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5311.28s)]
*  We've got a 1k Donov anonymous 1k Donov hell yeah. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5317.4s)]
*  Not necessarily condemning India's choice to take military action. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5320.32s)]
*  And what would China's position likely be because China is also in dispute with India over. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5323.799999999999s)]
*  I'm realizing how deep nationalism for India is ingrained in me before my eyes in the wake of this escalation. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5329.96s)]
*  Every point you're making is so logical but there's an internal resistance within me that's getting sad slash mad and I haven't actively worked to shut that part off and listen to the merits of the arguments just saying everyone is in perfect. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5334.2s)]
*  Chad is OK to be on a journey. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5343.44s)]
*  Hell yeah. Chatter. I mean that's that's what's incredibly important to do in a situation like this. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5345.12s)]
*  And it's one that I have also had to go through when thinking about like Kurdish resistance in Turkey or even unlearning the way I was taught about the Armenian. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5351.48s)]
*  Genocide in in Turkish education. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5364.04s)]
*  This is a this is a very important moment of reflection and it's at the heart of my commentary to try to get people to develop a different understanding of the world. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5367.4s)]
*  And it's the same thing that I do for Americans who also look at the situation and and develop resentment and and lean into their their biases from the jump. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5379.76s)]
*  Lean into their biases from the jump and just try to comfort themselves by by by refusing to entertain an alternative perspective. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5393.96s)]
*  Is the Israel parallel that hard to see. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5405.64s)]
*  It's not necessarily an Israel parallel because this is state versus state nuclear to nuclear armed states. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5407.6s)]
*  I was in a similar situation growing up. I had to unlearn all the Indian nationals when the Pakistani hate and Islamophobia that I was inundated with is a long process. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5414.4800000000005s)]
*  But I hope they can. But I hope I can help my fellow Indians get there someday. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5420.16s)]

*  I think it can be argued that India and Pakistan's populations and governments don't want to go to war. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5443.76s)]
*  But this crisis is anchored on a terrorist incident and a policy by India that has been in place for some time. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyubzVfx64&t=5449.679999999999s)]
