# NBC Interviews HasanAbi
**HasanAbi:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc)
*  I had seen a TikToker talk about her own personal experience a week prior. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=0.0s)]
*  She also had global entry. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=6.08s)]
*  And basically, I knew what was up. I knew what was coming. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=8.64s)]
*  I suspected this would most likely happen. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=13.36s)]
*  And given that I have immense privilege being a public personality [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=15.84s)]
*  and also having enough financial security to potentially go through a long and arduous legal process, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=21.36s)]
*  I wanted to see where this line of questioning would go. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=26.96s)]
*  All right. Hello? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=36.4s)]
*  Hello, Hassan? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=37.44s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=38.56s)]
*  Hey, thanks a lot for being with us tonight, sir. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=40.32s)]
*  I'm going to have audio check in and we'll be with you momentarily. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=42.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=45.28s)]
*  Hey, Hassan, it's audio. Can you hear us okay? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=46.8s)]
*  Yeah, I can hear you guys. Can you hear me? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=49.28s)]
*  Thank you. Loud and clear. Thank you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=51.68s)]
*  All right. Perfect. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=53.68s)]
*  Hi, Hassan. This is Liz, the producer in the control room. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=54.64s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=56.48s)]
*  Hi, I'm good. I'm live right now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=57.36s)]
*  Oh, perfect. Hello. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=60.08s)]
*  Oh, thank you for having me. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  So we are in a short commercial break. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=66.08s)]
*  And after that, we will be the first thing out of the commercial break. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=67.84s)]
*  Okay, perfect. Look at this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=70.32s)]
*  Behind the scenes. Can they see your comments? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=80.72s)]
*  No, they can't see your comments. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=83.28s)]
*  Have you considered starting the interview off like you're Joe Biden? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=85.36s)]
*  Stand by, Hassan. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=88.56s)]
*  What's up? Sorry. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=89.28s)]
*  Hey, welcome back now to this developing story that you can stand by. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=91.2s)]
*  We're in the segment now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=94.08s)]
*  Popular left-wing Twitch streamer and YouTuber Hassan Piker says he was detained at a US airport [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=95.36s)]
*  for hours this weekend and questioned by US Customs and Border Protection about his political [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=100.88s)]
*  beliefs specifically on Gaza and President Trump. Now he posted about it on X saying, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=106.16s)]
*  it wasn't that bad, but very strange experience overall though. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=111.28s)]
*  And Piker's post seems to have caught the attention of the Department of Homeland Security, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  who replied by saying, and I quote, lying for likes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=118.96s)]
*  Now we reached out to the DHS for comment. They told us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=123.52s)]
*  And again, quote, this is nothing but lying for likes. Hassan Piker joins us right now live. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=126.8s)]
*  Hassan, let's start right there with the DHS's response. Lying for likes. Calling it routine. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=132.88s)]
*  What's your response to their response? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=138.8s)]
*  I find it really strange that they consider asking questions that are very specific about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=141.44s)]
*  my political commentary in general as it pertains to Israel, Palestine, but also specifically around [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=147.44s)]
*  my loyalty to the current administration and Donald Trump as to be a part of a routine [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  inspection. I don't know if this is the Department of Homeland Security admitting that this is now [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=160.64s)]
*  going to be a routine part of the process at the point of entry into the country for American [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  citizens, or I don't know what they're actually trying to say at all, because they did not, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=169.52s)]
*  they did not deny that they actually detained me. They openly stated that they did that and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=175.52s)]
*  also released me after questioning. And the thing that they actually omitted in that, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=179.36s)]
*  in that statement was the questions themselves, the questions that they had asked. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=186.24s)]
*  And I think that's the main point of contention here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=191.52s)]
*  And this whole, like, the thing, I hate to say this, but one of the things that caught [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=193.52s)]
*  my attention, like you have global entry, right? That's supposed to be the expedited line. Walk us [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=198.16s)]
*  through how all this happened and has something like this ever happened before? I mean, I've [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=203.44s)]
*  gotten the quadruple S on my boarding pass in the past, but the apprehension or the questioning [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  process never actually escalated to the position that it got to this time around. This was my first [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=217.2s)]
*  time using global entry, as a matter of fact, I was coming back from France. I had gone to France [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=223.76s)]
*  with my family for Mother's Day to come back early because I had a speaking engagement at the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=227.44s)]
*  University of Chicago. And I got my picture taken a global entry, I walked in and the Customs and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=231.52s)]
*  Border Patrol agent at the gate told me to step aside, and that another agent would be coming over [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=238.96s)]
*  to take me to a separate location. And I knew that this was most likely going to happen because I'd [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  seen news reports about immigration attorneys being apprehended at the border and detained [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=250.0s)]
*  in question in a similar fashion. I'd seen a TikToker talk about her own personal experience [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=254.8s)]
*  a week prior. She also had global entry. And basically, I knew what was up, I knew what was [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=261.44s)]
*  coming. I suspected this would most likely happen. And given that I have immense privilege, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  being a public personality, and also having enough financial security to potentially go through a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=275.76s)]
*  long and arduous legal process, I wanted to see where this line of questioning would go, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=281.52s)]
*  this line of inquiry would go instead of immediately exercising my Fifth Amendment rights. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=288.0s)]
*  And they took me to a detention area. I was surrounded by terrified families sitting on a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=293.12s)]
*  bunch of pews. And I asked around to see if any of them actually had American passports. People [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  around me said they did not. There was an old lady in a wheelchair. And agents coming in and out of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  this other room with passports in hand telling the people slowly but surely that they could leave, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=310.0s)]
*  that they were cleared to leave. And then another agent came out and said my name. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=316.72s)]
*  They walked me into this back room with these two metal stools. Everything was bolted down. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=321.92s)]
*  And I sat down on the chair that I assume is normally reserved for the lawyer on the corner. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=327.2s)]
*  And in the process, they started asking me a bunch of questions. It's obvious, it felt like they [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=334.08s)]
*  knew who I was, given the line of questioning was very specific. It started off with like, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=340.16s)]
*  you know, what are you doing in Chicago? Things of that nature, pretty basic, boring stuff. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=349.04s)]
*  And the more I revealed information, the more the agent kept repeating, well, since you said that, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=353.36s)]
*  and acted like it was in line in the process of discovery, that he was getting new information [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=359.44s)]
*  out of me. He would be like, oh, you're in Chicago for, you're delivering a speech. Well, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=366.56s)]
*  since you said that, what do you do? Oh, you're a lawyer. Since you said that, what kind of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  stuff do you do on Twitch? And I told him I play video games, sometimes I talk about drama. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=375.52s)]
*  And basically, we arrived at questions about opinions were on Donald Trump. And I thought [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=380.16s)]
*  that was strange. But I was honest. At first, I said, what does this have to do with anything? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=389.04s)]
*  But then I told him I don't like Donald Trump. And after that, he asked me about my opinion on [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=393.2s)]
*  Israel, and my opinion on what's going on in Gaza, and whether or not I found him to be a [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  resistance group and found the Houthis to be a resistance group. Did I like the Houthis that I [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  like Hamas that I like Hezbollah, very specific questions that you would only ask if you already [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=410.4s)]
*  were familiar with my commentary, which is in office in normal circumstances in a completely [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=417.2s)]
*  academic setting describing, you know, the historic reasons for why resistance exists and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=425.52s)]
*  things of that nature. But it almost felt like he was trying to get something out of it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=430.96s)]
*  So it seemed clear to you that they knew who you were. Real quick, last question here. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=433.2s)]
*  What do you think would have happened if you weren't a citizen? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=444.0s)]
*  Oh, I think if I wasn't a citizen, the process would not have gone down as smoothly as it did, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=445.76s)]
*  I probably would not be allowed to enter the country as we've seen reports on French [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=452.96s)]
*  researchers, for example, being stopped at the border, and having ICE agents look through their [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=458.0s)]
*  phone to see if they've said something negative about Donald Trump. Even within the context of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=463.52s)]
*  Donald Trump taking away grants for academic research, any kind of negativity can be met with [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=468.96s)]
*  a border agent claiming that you know, you're ineligible to enter the country. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=474.32s)]
*  Non-citizens have significantly less rights than citizens do in this process. And it seems like [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=479.28s)]
*  even citizens are losing some of those rights as well. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=483.04s)]
*  Hassan Piker, we really appreciate you sharing your experience with us. Thank you so much. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=485.52s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=488.8s)]
*  Thank you, Hassan. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=489.68s)]
*  All right, have a good one. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=491.84s)]
*  You too. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=494.0s)]
*  Bye. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY5eR1cYUMc&t=494.88s)]
