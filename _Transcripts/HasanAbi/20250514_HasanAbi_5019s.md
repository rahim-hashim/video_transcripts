# Talking To Jeremy Scahill About His Hamas Interview
**HasanAbi:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY)
*  But at the end of the day, I mean, they're searching people's phones. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=0.0s)]
*  They're trying to deny entry based on social media postings. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4.72s)]
*  They're using AI now to review everyone's history. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=7.76s)]
*  You know, as a journalist, and I know we're going to talk about interviews with Hamas and other, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  you know, other groups, but journalists shouldn't have to think like they're spies. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=16.64s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=26.32s)]
*  I bring to you Jeremy Scahill of Dropsite News. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=30.0s)]
*  Jeremy, can you hear me? I'm calling him right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=34.88s)]
*  Hey, I'm here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=37.28s)]
*  All right. Perfect. Jeremy Scahill, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=38.32s)]
*  very excited to have you on the broadcast. Always an honor. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=42.0s)]
*  You have had a quite the eventful past month, I would say, of the reporting that you've done. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  And I'm very excited to hear your takes on Donald Trump's Middle East tour [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  that he is conducting currently. But yes, Jeremy also wanted to offer us a gift. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=61.6s)]
*  For those of you who want to support his reporting and many other friends of the show that I routinely [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=68.96000000000001s)]

*  Jeremy, how are you doing? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=97.28s)]
*  I'm good. I'm better than you after your encounter with the customs officials. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=99.92s)]
*  Well, yeah, but you haven't entered the United States recently, have you? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=104.72s)]
*  No, no, I haven't. And I actually I mean, you and I full disclosure, you and I talked, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=108.56s)]
*  you know, soon after that happened to you. And, you know, I had my own experience with, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=113.92s)]
*  with with being on the watch list for several years, actually under the Obama administration, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=119.44s)]
*  when I was investigating Obama's drone program, and I was traveling to Somalia, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=125.6s)]
*  Yemen, Afghanistan, elsewhere. And for several years, I was on, you know, I was on the watch [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=131.6s)]
*  list, which meant that every time I flew into the United States, I would get pulled aside for, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=138.56s)]
*  you know, what they called secondary screening. And, you know, everything that you described, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=144.48s)]
*  I had similar experiences. And, you know, what one of the things and this was, you know, this was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=148.16s)]
*  under under Obama, Mr. constitutional law scholar, you know, but now the stakes are, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=153.2s)]
*  are, have changed so dramatically. Wait, what is this thing here? Don't switch switch. Not doing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=159.68s)]
*  that. You can hear me fine, right? Yeah, yeah, you're you know, I mean, what one of the things [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=168.72s)]
*  that we're witnessing under Trump is, you know, obviously, they're they're targeting people for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=173.76s)]
*  deportation. They're going after people that are vulnerable, they're going after people also who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=180.4s)]
*  are legal permanent residents, you know, who have green cards, and there's some people calling for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=187.84s)]
*  going after naturalized US citizens as well. But in the bigger picture, what we're witnessing is an [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=192.24s)]
*  attempt to is to shred constitutional protections that have existed under both Democrats and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=198.24s)]
*  Republicans for a very, very long time, and to try to implement a system of deeming people persona [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=204.72s)]
*  on grata by presidential fiat. And so you know, what what you and you look, you're a high profile [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=213.12s)]
*  guy, and increasingly so you know, you just you just had a profile, well, I think was in the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=219.6s)]
*  fashion section, though. So it sort of doesn't count. But in a way, it does that you just had [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=223.76s)]
*  a major profile done of you. But as you as you and I discussed, you know, a lot of times, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  when I would get pulled aside for questioning, you know, I would go into a room, you know, there [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=233.6s)]
*  would already be several people in that room. And I knew when I set foot in it, that I was going to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=239.04s)]
*  get questioned before them, and I was going to get released before them. And you know, there was one [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=244.56s)]
*  one episode when I was flying from Cairo back into the United States, and I had happened to sit next [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=249.44s)]
*  to an Egyptian couple on the plane, it was a man and woman and their three kids. And they got pulled [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=255.04s)]
*  into the same screening room that I did for interrogation. And I was sort of playing with [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=262.8s)]
*  their kids and talking to them when we were in there. And they were saying to me, you know, can [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=267.52s)]
*  you can you wait for us outside? And I said, Yeah, of course, I'm gonna wait for you. And, you know, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=272.24s)]
*  so I went up, I had my, you know, my questioning there. And you know, you really shouldn't answer [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=278.0s)]
*  any of their questions outside of really basic biographical facts. I know there was some [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=284.08s)]
*  controversy about how you handled your interrogation. And, and, you know, and I saw your explanation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=287.84s)]
*  for that. But, you know, so I had my session, and then I left and I waited and an hour went by and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=292.72s)]
*  two hours went by and three hours went by and those people never came out of the airport. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=301.6s)]
*  And so, you know, presumably they were they were deported. And again, this was under, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=305.6s)]
*  under Obama, but, you know, we're facing a really dangerous situation. And I think it's, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=310.24s)]
*  it's so important that everyone speak out about it. You know, already that system of putting people [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=317.36s)]
*  on the watch list was rife with constitutional and civil rights abuses. You know, years ago, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=323.68s)]
*  I obtained the top secret government rule book for putting people on that watch list. It was a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  more than 180 pages long. And people can be placed onto a watch list because their number happened to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  be in the phone of someone else who happens to be communicating with someone in Yemen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=341.28s)]
*  You know, the standards by which you can end up on that list where you are and it's and it is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  you're designated as being on the watch list, even if they don't suspect you of being at all involved. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, people may not know this, but what the position the US government has taken is that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  you don't have constitutional rights in the airport. You know, my friend Hiba Jamal, who's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=360.4s)]
*  a Palestinian American journalist, recently wrote about her she lives in Germany, she, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=364.96s)]
*  she recently wrote about her experience flying back into Newark where she, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=369.76s)]
*  an American citizen was told that she needed to unlock her phone for the authorities and that her [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=373.44s)]
*  husband who is not an American citizen needed to unlock his phone under threat of immediate [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=378.96s)]
*  detention and eventual deportation. You know, and it's these are very, very serious issues. And if [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=384.32s)]
*  you think it's it can't come for you, you're wrong. It can come for you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. So what, I mean, I have been listening to lawyers quite a bit on this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=394.4s)]
*  about like how to potentially tackle that issue. Specifically the, the, that was my red line in that, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=403.52s)]
*  in that interaction. Like I knew that as soon as they asked me to unlock my phone, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=414.88s)]
*  that was when I was going to refuse. And, and it luckily never got to that. But it is an illegal [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=419.68s)]
*  gray zone. Airports are technically an illegal gray zone, I guess, which is part of the problem. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=431.04s)]
*  And, and there's also the, the notion of material support and what constitutes for material support [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=436.8s)]
*  that they're very clearly trying to, to expand on and maybe even factor in, you know, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=443.92s)]
*  constitutionally protected speech as material support. We saw this with, we saw this with what [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  Marco Rubio stated in the apprehension and false detention of Mahmoud Khalil and numerous others. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=459.92s)]
*  And I don't really know how to combat it beyond the fact that you just, you know, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=466.0s)]
*  don't allow biometrics and say, I refuse, you can't compel me to do this, you know, and then, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=470.88s)]
*  and then demand legal representation, right? Yeah. I mean, look, there's, but there's different [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=476.96s)]
*  categories here. You know, if, if it was you or it was me, you know, we can be confrontational [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=481.36s)]
*  about asserting our rights. You know, we're, we're holders of American passports and that puts us in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=487.68s)]
*  a, in a different category, certainly in the eyes of the Trump administration. You know, I mean, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=493.44s)]
*  they're still pushing forward with attempting to deport Mahmoud Khalil. Some judges, to their [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=499.76s)]
*  credit, have recently ordered freedom for other people who are being detained in what I think is [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=506.4s)]
*  clearly an unconstitutional manner. But if you, you know, if you're from a vulnerable population [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=513.28s)]
*  and your immigration status is not that you hold an American passport and you then want to get [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=518.64s)]
*  confrontational with the authorities in the airport, you're, you're, you're going to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=525.52s)]
*  potentially be in a world of hurt. And that's why I think it's, you know, it's important for, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=529.28s)]
*  you know, those of us who have a more secure immigration status in the United States, if we [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  end up in this position to really assert our rights. But, you know, at the end of the day, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=538.64s)]
*  it's the old adage that activists are all taught. You don't talk to the cops. Yeah. You know, you, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=544.0s)]
*  you just, you don't, you don't talk to the cops and, you know, they're going to tell you that you [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=548.56s)]
*  have no right to remain silent. They're going to tell you that you, you, you don't, that you, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=553.36s)]
*  you misunderstand the rights that you have there. It's, it's, it's better to take the heat on them [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=557.76s)]
*  there and just keep asserting you want to speak to a lawyer. No, you're not going to unlock your [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=562.24s)]
*  device. No, you're not going to answer questions about your opinions. You know, I was always told [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=566.64s)]
*  by lawyers, you answer the most basic factual things. Where are you coming from? What is the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=571.44s)]
*  address that you're going to? Basic biographical information that exists on your passport. You, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=576.48s)]
*  what you think of Donald Trump. They don't have any business asking you who you talk to somewhere. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=581.6s)]
*  And I'm, and quite honestly, you know, I think it's unconstitutional that they believe that it's [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=586.72s)]
*  perfectly acceptable to tell people, I'm going to open your phone and start searching through it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=590.88s)]
*  But they've done that. And unfortunately courts have sided with this system for many years and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=594.48s)]
*  it's getting worse. Absolutely. I mean, this is the, in many ways, as you said with Obama, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  this is the logical conclusion of, of the, the surveillance state and the expansion of the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=606.4s)]
*  surveillance state, especially in the post 9 11 universe, like in the war on terror and with the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=614.48s)]
*  democratic party's inability or disinterest in actually scaling back these oftentimes unlawful [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  search and seizure methods and setting precedents over and over again to, to allow further [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=627.28s)]
*  violations of our civil liberties and our privacy. Yeah. I mean, there's another aspect to this too, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=636.4s)]
*  which is, you know, I mean, if I come back into the United States and I've never, you know, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=640.8s)]
*  I've never really contemplated this outside of a few specific periods when there was a lot of heat [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=645.92s)]
*  on us because of certain journalistic projects that we're doing, I'm not setting foot in a U S [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=651.6s)]
*  airport with data on my phone. And, you know, I may, I may not even, I mean, first of all, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=656.32s)]
*  at a minimum, you should be completely wiping your phone clean. When you get to where you're going, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  you can download the data that you need, but you should not be walking in, you know, with a phone [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=668.4000000000001s)]
*  full of all of your contacts and everything to that airport. And, you know, there's some people [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=674.24s)]
*  that say strategically, I mean, you get into the weeds of this, they say, well, if you pass them an [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=678.32s)]
*  empty phone, what does that mean? So some people say, well, I'm going to, I'll put some photographs [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=682.48s)]
*  on the phone, but I'm not going to have any of my social media stuff. I'm not going to have my [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=686.4s)]
*  contacts on there. But at the, at the end of the day, I mean, they're, they're, they're searching [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  people's phones. They're trying to deny entry based on social media postings. They're using AI [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=694.72s)]
*  now to review everyone's history, you know, as a, as a journalist. And it's, and I know we're going [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  to talk about interviews with Hamas and other, you know, other groups, but journalists shouldn't [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=704.4s)]
*  have to think like they're spies. It should be a basic constitutionally protected aspect [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=710.64s)]
*  of journalism. There's a reason why journalists are specifically mentioned, you know, that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=716.96s)]
*  the journalism and a free press is specifically mentioned in founding documents of the United [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=723.68s)]
*  States, because it's that essential to the existence of a democratic society. So, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=728.24s)]
*  you know, when, when you could be criminalized for interviewing, yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=734.16s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Well, one thing I wanted to mention here and stress is that there was the actionable [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=738.0s)]
*  side and there was the information gathering side that was like simply designed in my opinion to, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=743.76s)]
*  to threaten people like myself, the first half of the interviewers, the second half of the interview [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=748.8s)]
*  after he like left for, you know, 35 minutes or so. And in the second side, the actionable side was [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=754.56s)]
*  like basic questionnaire, basic questions that I've been asked by authorities in the past as well. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=760.72s)]
*  Things like, have you been in, have you offered material support to Hamas, Hezbollah or Houthis [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=768.32s)]
*  and things of that nature? And if obviously, if your answer is yes to any of those questions, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=775.52s)]
*  like that you will be detained, you will be jailed because that is illegal, right? But one of the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=779.68s)]
*  questions in that process that they asked that I thought was very strange was, have you been in [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=785.76s)]
*  contact with someone from Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis? And have you interviewed someone from [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=790.88s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis? And that right there, knowing full well that I am a member of [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=796.16s)]
*  the media, that question being asked of me in the actionable side of things means that they are, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  I think, trying to criminalize conducting interviews with members of like known [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=809.52s)]
*  state department assigned terror organizations. And I feel like that's insane because that would [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=816.7199999999999s)]
*  mean that every CNN journalist, Clarissa Ward could go to jail, you could go to jail potentially. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=821.5200000000001s)]
*  And I guess even Trump could go to jail because he just met with the HDS guy who changed his name to [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=828.8800000000001s)]
*  Ahmed Sharab, but before, I guess he was known as Jelani, who was a leader in Al-Qaeda in Syria and a [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=838.72s)]
*  leader in ISIS adjacent groups, a member of the US terror watch that's like specifically himself [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=848.4s)]
*  on the US air watches with a $10 million bounty on him. So who makes these rules up? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=857.12s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie Let's fly up to like 30,000 feet and remember something that Nelson Mandela [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=863.92s)]
*  remained on the terrorism watch list for years after he was freed from [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=872.72s)]
*  Robben Island prison and became the president of a new independent South Africa. And so these [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=881.04s)]
*  designations and the use of the term terrorism has been so overused and abused to deprive it of any [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=890.16s)]
*  actual meaning. If we want to actually talk about what is terrorism in the world today, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=897.6s)]
*  we can look no further than the Israeli actions in Gaza and in the West Bank. That is classic [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=903.28s)]
*  terrorism that Israel is engaged in. So when they say, oh, well, so-and-so is a designated terrorist, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=910.48s)]
*  it has no actual meaning anymore because terrorism is a term that is wielded by the powerful [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=918.32s)]
*  often to apply a label to people that are fighting for self-determination or for liberation. It is a [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=923.9200000000001s)]
*  total abuse of the English language to apply that term to many individuals and groups that the United [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=931.44s)]
*  States and Israel apply that label to. So that's the first thing we need to recognize and that [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  many people have been designated as terrorists by the US state who actually are freedom fighters. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  It's not that there aren't people on that list who have conducted acts that could be legally [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=951.6s)]
*  categorized as terrorism, but they've used it so much that it actually is meaningless. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=955.84s)]
*  And exhibit A of terrorism in the world today is the US client state of Israel and its war of mass [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=961.44s)]
*  extermination against the Palestinian people. Also, even Luigi Mangione, when you talk about [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  domestic figures like Luigi Mangione is currently being tried for being a domestic terrorist. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=974.88s)]
*  Does this mean that we are not allowed to conduct an interview if given the opportunity with Luigi [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=983.3599999999999s)]
*  Mangione? It just doesn't make sense. It's a complete vague. It's definitely vague and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=987.28s)]
*  it's deliberate that it's vague. It's just created to deny habeas corpus to people at a time when the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=994.16s)]
*  administration is actually trying to move the needle on removing habeas corpus in its entirety. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1001.44s)]
*  And it's something that even Steve Bannon has talked about. What they're doing in the UK. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  They're doing this in the UK now with Palestine Action activists, the people that have been [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1011.44s)]
*  targeting Elbit Systems, the Israeli manufacturer of drones and other technology. They're going [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1015.36s)]
*  after people and they're applying this label terrorist. And we're going to talk about my [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  conversations with officials from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. I've interviewed [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1027.84s)]
*  people from all of the H's that you mentioned before because I think that's the responsible [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1034.08s)]
*  thing to do journalistically. It's journalistic malpractice that major publications are not [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  regularly interviewing officials from these organizations and trying to understand their [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1045.6799999999998s)]
*  perspective and the context there. Simply talking to officials from Hamas or Islamic Jihad or Hezbollah [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1052.8s)]
*  is not an endorsement of those individuals. It's called basic journalism. So that's really the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1061.76s)]
*  first principle that we need to put on the table. It's not that CNN doesn't interview Hamas officials [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1067.2s)]
*  or the New York Times doesn't interview Hamas officials, but generally it falls into a basic [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1073.68s)]
*  pattern, which is that no matter what is happening in Gaza, no matter what's happening in the ceasefire [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1078.96s)]
*  negotiation process, you have a Hamas official interviewed by a Western journalist and all they [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1084.4s)]
*  want to do is re-litigate the events of October 7th. And often the questioning includes outright [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1089.44s)]
*  lies or falsehoods about the events of October 7th. So that's what you typically see these [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1096.48s)]
*  officials subjected to when they do agree to go on, whether it's BBC or it's CNN or [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1102.0s)]
*  other news outlets, or in the case of the New York Times, they'll conduct a lengthy [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1107.76s)]
*  interview with someone from Hamas and then they'll just use like two sentences of it. And usually [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1113.2s)]
*  those two sentences are meant to kind of bolster the case that they're making by talking to all of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1118.0s)]
*  their Israeli sources. So that's basically the thrust of what we get in the media. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
*  But what the US learned and what Adam Bowler, who was one of Jared Kushner's college roommates, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1128.08s)]
*  was Donald Trump's special envoy on hostages, he goes over and he meets with Hamas officials. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1134.24s)]
*  And I actually then met with the two main Hamas officials that met with Adam Bowler. And I talked [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1141.68s)]
*  to them at length about what it was like speaking with Adam Bowler. And they said that Bowler kept [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1147.36s)]
*  telling them, you guys are so different than I imagined that I had been led to believe. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1152.08s)]
*  You know, that Bowler is not a swamp creature. He's not from the consultancy class. He's not [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1156.96s)]
*  Antony Blinken, who is paid by the makers of tanks to think when he's not officially in government. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1162.64s)]
*  He's still Jared Kushner's friend. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1168.8000000000002s)]
*  But sometimes that works. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1171.68s)]
*  Right. I mean, he's like Jared Kushner's beer bong buddy. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1172.72s)]
*  Yeah. But that's- [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1174.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's- [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1175.6000000000001s)]
*  It's the same thing with Witkoff. Like, he's not like a brilliant tactician. He's not a guy who's [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1176.3200000000002s)]
*  been inundated with like American foreign policy attitudes like Blinken was, but he has forced [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1184.56s)]
*  Israel to make concessions that Israel seemingly never took with the previous administration [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1192.56s)]
*  due to his lack of interest in abiding by U.S. standards up until that moment. Like sometimes [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1199.6s)]
*  that is what takes. Sometimes it is what it takes to actually come to a managed resolution. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1207.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, also just on a factual level, from the beginning of Netanyahu's declaration [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1214.8s)]
*  of his war of annihilation against the Palestinians of Gaza, he sought to portray Hamas as akin to [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  ISIS or al-Qaeda. And the fact that Hamas has never engaged in any operations outside of the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1228.32s)]
*  territory of historic Palestine is an inconvenient fact that no one ever wants to talk about. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1236.56s)]
*  Whatever you think of the historical methods that have been used by the Palestinian resistance [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1241.84s)]
*  since the first Palestinian Intifada around the time when Hamas was formed, the fact is that this [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1247.9199999999998s)]
*  is a national liberation struggle that is using means of violence to try to achieve a political [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1256.32s)]
*  objective. And so if you want to talk about Hamas and its tactics or its methods, at least have [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1264.3999999999999s)]
*  your starting point be based on accuracy. Have your starting point be based on facts. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1270.96s)]
*  And so Netanyahu went to great lengths to say that Israel is fighting for the very existence [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1276.56s)]
*  of Western civilization itself. It is complete nonsense, complete propaganda, but clearly [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1282.72s)]
*  it is believed by so many people in power in Washington. And so when that is the setup, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1288.24s)]
*  and that's what you're told constantly, and the U.S. has this slavish devotion to the Israeli [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1294.56s)]
*  narrative, and then a kind of normie like Adam Bowler ends up in the room, he immediately starts [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1299.12s)]
*  to feel this discomfort inside of him because he's saying, well, wait a minute, why aren't they [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1305.36s)]
*  trying to put a hood on me and film a beheading video with me? Or why aren't they talking about [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1309.4399999999998s)]
*  death to Jews? Why is it that they're pointing to a 2017 charter that says that Hamas is a two-state [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1314.3999999999999s)]
*  resolution if it's the will of the Palestinian people? The whole mythology gets dismantled. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1320.8s)]
*  And so Bowler with, I'll tell you one funny thing, I spent a lot of time speaking on background with [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1327.12s)]
*  Hamas officials, and then I did some, you know, I recorded on-the-record interviews, but a lot of [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1334.3999999999999s)]
*  it was just sort of talking to them on background, trying to understand their perspective on the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1337.92s)]
*  current negotiations, on what's happening with Trump, on Netanyahu's threats to conquer and seize [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1341.6s)]
*  all of Gaza. But it comes up at one point where they were saying the Israelis really tried to [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1346.56s)]
*  destroy Bowler after he met with us, and they did. You know, Ron Nürmer and these guys lost [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1352.96s)]
*  their minds and they were smearing him. And, you know, the first question that he's asked by Jake [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1357.3600000000001s)]
*  Tapper on CNN is basically, what was it like to sit with unrepentant anti-Semitic people who just [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1361.6000000000001s)]
*  want to murder Jews? That was basically the opening question from Jake Tapper, who is a major [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1368.16s)]
*  facilitator of the genocidal narrative on behalf of the Israelis. That's his main role that he's [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1372.32s)]
*  served over the past 19 months. So that's the opening question to Adam Bowler. And then he's [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1378.6399999999999s)]
*  just getting attacked and then these Republican senators start going after him and they want him [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1383.2s)]
*  removed. But Trump doesn't remove him. It seemed like maybe he was going to be gone. But then I'm [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1386.8799999999999s)]
*  talking to Hamas people and they're like, you know, how come Bowler got put back into play? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1391.84s)]
*  And I was like, well, he's one of Jared Kushner's college roommates and he's a close friend of the [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1396.0s)]
*  Trump family. And they were like, what? They didn't know. They didn't know that Bowler had that family [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1400.24s)]
*  connection to Trump. I'm telling that story as just a vignette because it's sort of a surreal [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1405.12s)]
*  thing that played out there. And then Bowler goes not only on US TV, but on Israeli television. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1410.56s)]
*  And he pretty accurately describes what Hamas's answer is to the question of what is your [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1417.6s)]
*  resolution to all of this. And he says Hamas is proposing a multi-year, all for all deal with [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1423.6s)]
*  Israel, where they would have what's called an Arabica hoodna, a long-term truce that they would [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1429.92s)]
*  release every single Israeli captive. They would want huge numbers of Palestinian hostages released [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1435.2s)]
*  from Israeli custody. There are upwards of 10,000 Palestinians and, you know, among them women and [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1441.76s)]
*  children and a couple of thousand people from Gaza who were kidnapped and held hostage explicitly [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1448.5600000000002s)]
*  for the purpose of exchanging them in these exchange deals. So Bowler goes on Israeli [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1454.88s)]
*  television and US television and he's pretty accurately describing what Hamas's position is. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1460.72s)]
*  He even said they're not beasts to Jake Tapper, I believe, as well, which is the worst person. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1466.16s)]
*  Yeah, the whole thing. Oh, they're going to have horns growing out of their head. But, you know, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1470.3200000000002s)]
*  so then the most recent thing, you know, that happens is, so the Israelis, what I was told by [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1474.48s)]
*  Hamas was that the next step in this was going to be that they were going to have a direct meeting [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1478.96s)]
*  with Steve Witkoff, who is the envoy for Donald Trump, Donald Trump's golf buddy, who's now in [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1484.08s)]
*  charge of ending the Ukraine War and dealing with the Gaza ceasefire negotiations. And so, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1489.52s)]
*  you know, the Hamas assessment was that the Israelis, by smearing Bowler and making this [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1495.12s)]
*  big deal about it, and they were the ones that made public the fact that the US had done these [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1499.1999999999998s)]
*  negotiations, that they sabotaged then this direct meeting with Witkoff. And so then what happens is [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1502.96s)]
*  March 18th comes and Israel resumes its scorched earth bombing of Gaza. And to this moment, they've [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1509.92s)]
*  killed almost 3000 Palestinians since Israel unilaterally broke the ceasefire and resumed [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1516.72s)]
*  the terror bombings of Gaza. Today alone, more than 80 Palestinians have been killed since [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1523.6000000000001s)]
*  dawn this morning. There was a horrifying attack on yet another hospital, supposedly in the name [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1531.52s)]
*  of trying to kill Mohammed Sinwar, the most senior commander now of Al Qassam Brigades, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1537.84s)]
*  the armed wing of Hamas. And the Israelis will use, we're trying to kill this commander, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1544.0s)]
*  and in the process, it's okay if we mass kill dozens of other people and burn women and children [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1551.1999999999998s)]
*  alive in tents. So Israel then goes full scorched earth. But then last weekend, out of nowhere, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1556.24s)]
*  the sort of diplomacy intensifies, and we hear that a deal has been reached to [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1564.16s)]
*  release Edon Alexander, who is an American citizen who was in the Israeli military. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1571.2s)]
*  You know, much of the coverage of Edon Alexander, this 20-something from New Jersey, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1577.92s)]
*  has portrayed it as though he was at the Nova Music Festival and was just like at a rave or [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1582.88s)]
*  something and then got kidnapped by terrorists. Let's put facts on the table here. Edon Alexander, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1588.4s)]
*  an American citizen from New Jersey, enlisted in the Israeli military. He was in the Israeli army, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1596.3200000000002s)]
*  active duty on October 7, 2023, when he was taken captive by Palestinian fighters at a military [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1603.2800000000002s)]
*  base that is used to constantly mow the lawn, as they say in Gaza. And he was brought back as a [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1611.44s)]
*  Hamas and the Qassam Brigades considered him not a hostage, not a civilian, but a prisoner of war. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1618.3999999999999s)]
*  Edon Alexander was the first male soldier released since October of 2023 by the Palestinian [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1625.9199999999998s)]
*  resistance, and it came about as a result of direct negotiations by the Trump administration [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1634.48s)]
*  through mediators, Egypt and Qatar, with Hamas. This is an extraordinary... Whatever anyone thinks [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1640.0s)]
*  about Trump, there are extraordinary things happening right now and happening in the Gulf, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1646.48s)]
*  things that never in a million years would the George Bushes or the Joe Biden's or even the [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1650.56s)]
*  Barack Obamas of the world have done. Trump not only authorizes direct negotiations with Hamas, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1656.08s)]
*  and not only on the issue, but a comprehensive discussion with his envoys. He also makes a deal [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1663.52s)]
*  with Ansar Allah, commonly known as the Houthis in Yemen. And what was that deal that Trump made, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1669.6s)]
*  and this was brokered by the Sultanate of Oman, Trump makes a deal that says, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1675.76s)]
*  if the Houthis agree to stop firing at American ships, we're going to agree to stop bombing Yemen. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1682.64s)]
*  And my colleague Shoaib Al-Mosawa and I did a story that we understand played a role in this. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1689.92s)]
*  We interviewed Mohammed Al-Bukhati, who was a senior figure within Ansar Allah many weeks ago, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  and he told us on the record this very thing, if the Americans agree to stop bombing us, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1704.24s)]
*  we'll agree to stop attacking American ships. And by the way, they hadn't attacked a civilian [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1709.1200000000001s)]
*  cargo ship under Donald Trump at all. That was also part of the big lie. But putting that aside [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1714.16s)]
*  for a moment, the significance of this is that the US made a deal that didn't include Israel. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1718.72s)]
*  Why does that matter? Because Ansar Allah's entire reason for the maritime blockade and for [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1725.36s)]
*  launching attacks against Israel, and just a few days ago, they did a devastating attack on Ben [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1731.84s)]
*  Gurion Airport. They are regularly penetrating the much-vaunted Israeli air defense systems. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1736.9599999999998s)]
*  And Ansar Allah cannot be stopped right now. They have weapons production facilities deeply [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1744.24s)]
*  embedded in the mountains. This is a tiny group of people that control part of Yemen. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1750.9599999999998s)]
*  And it has almost no water to speak of, one of the poorest countries in the world, and it's not even [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1757.84s)]
*  an official government in the eyes of the United States. So what Ansar Allah has been able to do [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1770.24s)]
*  puts to shame so many Arab countries that have done nothing more than issue sort of strongly [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1775.92s)]
*  worded statements condemning what Israel is doing in Gaza. So Trump makes a deal that doesn't include [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1782.64s)]
*  Israel that says, okay, we're going to act in the US now. We don't attack us. We don't attack you. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1788.24s)]
*  But what they didn't do is say, you can't attack Israeli-linked ships anymore. What they didn't [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1793.68s)]
*  say is you need to stop striking Tel Aviv until the siege is lifted and the genocide is halted. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1797.92s)]
*  That's extraordinary. Trump makes this deal with them. As we speak, they're negotiating with Iran. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1804.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, there has been a sea change in the posture of Trump from his first administration [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1810.24s)]
*  to this one, where the whole point of the first administration was let's build a coalition that [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1816.16s)]
*  hates Iran and try to normalize all of these agreements between Israel and Arab nations. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1821.12s)]
*  And now Trump goes and he denounces neocons. He denounces the interventionists. He makes [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1828.16s)]
*  statements that are almost unheard of in the context of post-war on terror, post-911 American [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1834.96s)]
*  posture in the world. And, you know, I don't mean to be heaping praise on Trump. I'm just factually [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1843.04s)]
*  recognizing that there are events happening that are extraordinary right now. And at the heart of [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1847.92s)]
*  it is Trump's willingness to sort of talk to anybody. And actually that's what journalists [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1853.8400000000001s)]
*  should be doing too. Yeah. So going back to, there's a couple of things that I want to address here [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1859.68s)]
*  and I want to get your opinion on, or at least stress the importance of. Given the fact that [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1864.72s)]
*  the Trump administration cutting Israel out of the ceasefire negotiations that were conducted in Oman [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1872.64s)]
*  with the Ansar Allah movement, given the outline of that ceasefire negotiation was so similar to [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1878.96s)]
*  the initial reporting that you conducted. Do you feel like that played a role in the Trump [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1889.12s)]
*  administration seeing whatever demands that the Ansar Allah movement might've had considering that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1896.2399999999998s)]
*  they seemingly did not have any other back channel communications with them at the time? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1903.1999999999998s)]
*  And I mean, in fairness, the reason why I ask this question is because I want to stress the [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1907.9199999999998s)]
*  importance once again of conducting these sorts of interviews with members that are designated as [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1912.08s)]
*  enemies of the state or terror groups and how that can, that journalism can lead to positive results [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1920.72s)]
*  overall or results that even the American State Department might inevitably consider to be [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1927.12s)]
*  beneficial. First of all, if you pay attention to the communications of Ansar Allah and sort of their [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1931.36s)]
*  political western news outlets do, or probably even western governments to a large extent, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1939.12s)]
*  this has more or less been their position for a while. They haven't said, oh, we want to be in [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1945.4399999999998s)]
*  a war against the United States. As happens with Hamas, as happens with Hezbollah, there's a [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1950.08s)]
*  cartoonish portrayal of what is Ansar Allah's political agenda here. What they need to do, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1956.1599999999999s)]
*  what powerful western entities need to do in order to justify their bombings, their sanctions, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1961.68s)]
*  et cetera, is to pretend or portray their adversaries as having no actual political [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1968.8s)]
*  objectives. Ansar Allah has a very clear political objective with what it's doing in the Red Sea [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1975.84s)]
*  and what it's doing toward Israel. They opened a solidarity front because of the Israeli genocide, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1981.36s)]
*  and they have said that they're taking their lead from the Palestinian resistance on the ground in [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1988.4s)]
*  Gaza, and they have kept their word. When the Palestinians have engaged in a ceasefire or a [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=1993.2800000000002s)]
*  truce with Israel, Ansar Allah lifts its blockade and respects the ceasefire. When Israel imposed [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2000.3200000000002s)]
*  a full-spectrum blockade on March 2nd, the Houthis gave Israel a four or five-day warning and said, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2008.0800000000002s)]
*  if you don't lift this, we're going to resume our blockade. Then the day came, and the head of the [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2014.72s)]
*  Ansar Allah movement gave a speech and said, it's back on again. Let's not pretend they're irrational [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2020.5600000000002s)]
*  or that they don't have a political agenda or that they don't have a basis that much of the [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2026.96s)]
*  world understands for the actions that they're doing. They're doing the only thing that a tiny, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2031.92s)]
*  disempowered country like Yemen could do, and it's remarkably effective. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2037.68s)]
*  We were aware that this was being said by Ansar Allah and felt that this needs to be known by a [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2045.44s)]
*  wider audience of people. So, Shoaib was able to get in contact with Mohammed Al-Bukhaiti, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2053.36s)]
*  did an extensive interview, and people can read the interview, in which he says quite bluntly, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2059.92s)]
*  I do have a message for Donald Trump, and the message is we don't want to be in a war with you. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2066.16s)]
*  Our objective has to do with Israel and its genocidal war against the Palestinians of Gaza. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2071.6s)]
*  So, we did hear through the grapevine that once we did it, once we published this story, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2076.7999999999997s)]
*  that it made the way in national security circles within the Trump administration, because [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2082.3999999999996s)]
*  this was the most prominent depiction of a position that Ansar Allah had held for quite some time. So, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2088.4s)]
*  I definitely don't want to say, oh, we were behind this, but I think that it shows that even a [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2097.04s)]
*  relatively small independent news outlet, if you're willing to do serious journalism and you're not [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2102.8s)]
*  afraid of the labels that get thrown on you for daring to speak to the unmentionables of the world, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2108.88s)]
*  that actually it's a public service. It's what we should be doing. And I would encourage people, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2114.8s)]
*  I spoke to Osama Hamdan, one of the most senior officials within Hamas, who's a very interesting [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2121.84s)]
*  guy. He's been in the Hamas movement since 1992. He's a chemist by training. He speaks excellent [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2127.84s)]
*  English. He's been one of the most prominent spokespeople for Hamas since October 7th, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2135.6800000000003s)]
*  because he happened to be based in Lebanon at the time the attacks took place, and he was holding [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2141.36s)]
*  regular press conferences. So, he's basically a household name in much of the Arabic language [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2146.7200000000003s)]
*  media, but largely not known or understood in the US media. And when you listen to actually his [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2151.92s)]
*  take on things and the historical context that he brings to it, you start to really understand [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2159.92s)]
*  the political evolution of Hamas, how they see Israel, what they believe are reasonable [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2166.08s)]
*  solutions to put forward, and the language of diplomacy toward Trump I found quite interesting [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2172.32s)]
*  from Osama Hamdan. It's not that they're not critical of Trump. They're very clear. They [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2178.16s)]
*  understand this is an administration stacked with Zionists. They know who Mike Huckabee is and what [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2182.0s)]
*  it represents, that a Christian Zionist fanatic lunatic has been placed as the US ambassador to [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2186.88s)]
*  Israel. They know Mariam Adelson was the top donor to Trump's campaign, and she believes the [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2192.88s)]
*  annexation of the West Bank. And they understand that Donald Trump, for various reasons, is going [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2197.12s)]
*  to always support Israel's agenda. But they also see opportunity in the fact that Trump is different. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2202.1600000000003s)]
*  Trump is a transactional person. Trump fancies himself untangling the mess that Joe Biden made. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2209.36s)]
*  Trump also, it's not just about Trump's business in the Middle East. It's the Trump family business [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2216.7200000000003s)]
*  in the Middle East as well, which is the context for everything we're seeing happening in Saudi [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2222.48s)]
*  Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates. There's the Qatar jet, which has taken all of the attention, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2227.28s)]
*  and it's a fascinating side story to all of this. But Trump is not just doing these record-shattering [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2234.64s)]
*  weapons deals where it's going to be 1.2 trillion from the Saudis, 1.2 trillion from the Qataris, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2241.76s)]
*  1.2 trillion from the United Arab Emirates, the largest deal ever signed with Boeing [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2248.08s)]
*  happened today between Qatar airways and Boeing. It's also that Trump is setting up his family [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2252.96s)]
*  business. They're already deeply immersed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They already have that [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2260.3199999999997s)]
*  business. So what is the opportunity for the Palestinians here? It's kind of sick that this [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2266.08s)]
*  is the possibility, Hassan, but the possibility here is that Netanyahu's war, his [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2270.72s)]
*  genocidal, bloodthirsty war of annihilation is messing with Trump's business in the broader [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2278.0s)]
*  Middle East. They almost didn't talk about Gaza at all in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed bin Salman made [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2284.48s)]
*  one comment about how we should apply the Arab peace initiative and we need to bring an end to [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2290.4s)]
*  the war in Gaza. Trump basically said almost nothing about Gaza when he was there. They didn't [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2295.28s)]
*  really want it to be the issue. But Trump knows- Or the only thing that he brought up was that they [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2300.4s)]
*  were like, they were being backed by, I mean, it was mostly anti-Iran. Their angle on Gaza is [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2303.84s)]
*  mostly still like anti-Iran. They talk about Hamas as being like an Iranian backed form of militancy. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2310.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he, and he said that, you know, they were child killer, rapists or something. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2316.08s)]
*  When, when talking about like how the, this fundamentalist country is like backing them and, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2325.36s)]
*  and that was pretty much it. And there is the depravity of Gulf nation leadership, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2330.24s)]
*  if we're being real and we're being honest, in terms of refusing to apply more pressure points [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2335.12s)]
*  to the Trump administration, or even like offering bribes to the Trump administration in the exact [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2343.12s)]
*  same way that Israel does in an effort to continue the flow of weapons into Israel that end up being [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2347.8399999999997s)]
*  used against children in the Gaza strip. I mean, you, you, you look at the glitz and the glamour [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2353.8399999999997s)]
*  and the fetting of Trump and, and you know, you have Elon Musk and all of these tech executives [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2359.2s)]
*  coming in there and Trump is marveling at the marble and talking about how phenomenal the [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2363.7599999999998s)]
*  materials are. And they, and, and, and the actual backdrop for this is children being burned alive [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2369.4399999999996s)]
*  in tents, children being burned alive in tents with American weapons, children being burned alive [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2375.4399999999996s)]
*  in tents with American weapons and total silence from the Mohammed bin Salman's of the world, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2380.7999999999997s)]
*  who himself is a total butcher for what he did to the people of Yemen. This is a, this was a [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2386.08s)]
*  cacophony, a conference of butchers and, and, and enablers of genocide, either through the [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2391.52s)]
*  facilitation Trump does by giving the weapons and the political support to Netanyahu or by the [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2397.7599999999998s)]
*  shameful silence of all of these Arab rulers who, you know, they, they, they spend all day [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2403.2799999999997s)]
*  celebrating Trump, Trump, worshiping him at his feet. Oh, people are going to name their kids [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2410.64s)]
*  after Trump now in these Gulf nations. Have they no shame when they then look at the screens, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2416.72s)]
*  when they go back to their offices or their palaces and watch what's happening in Gaza? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2423.9199999999996s)]
*  The backdrop to this is burning, incinerating children and women and targeting tents with so [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2430.16s)]
*  called suicide drones and bombing hospitals and killing Hassan Slaya, one of the best journalists [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2437.2s)]
*  in Gaza, as he was receiving treatment in a burn unit where he had multiple fingers amputated [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2442.72s)]
*  because Israel tried by bombing a tent on April 7th. That's the backdrop to everything that we're [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2449.04s)]
*  seeing. So I can talk about what is extraordinary about what Trump's doing, but let's never forget [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2455.7599999999998s)]
*  the moral question here. And that is that the charade we are watching where the wealthy and [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2460.4s)]
*  powerful of the world gather together to fluff each other, pat each other on the back, sign their [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2465.76s)]
*  big weapons deals, talk about a new vision for the Middle East while simultaneously facilitating [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2471.44s)]
*  the incineration of Palestinian children. That should be the headline on all of this. That's [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2476.7200000000003s)]
*  the thing that actually matters the most. Absolutely. So because of this, this is actually [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2481.92s)]
*  what I wanted to talk about. I wanted to maybe speculate a little bit about where this deal may [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2489.2s)]
*  head. Now you have gotten great insight from Hamas leadership on this matter with your interviews. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2497.2s)]
*  I read the Osama Hamdan one on stream. It was fantastic. I've seen pieces. I've read parts of [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2503.2s)]
*  the Palestinian Islamic Jihad interview that you conducted as well, where they said, look, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2509.3599999999997s)]
*  like decapitating Hamas leadership or decapitating, like, or trying to actively demilitarize [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2514.24s)]
*  the Palestinian resistance or Palestinian militancy is not going to yield the results that Israel wants [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2522.3199999999997s)]
*  out of this because there's always going to be resistance as long as the apartheid exists, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2527.2799999999997s)]
*  which is of course a perfectly reasonable and perfectly understandable position to take. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2530.7999999999997s)]
*  But having said that, Israel is a belligerent actor. It's a belligerent occupier in the legal [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2536.56s)]
*  sense and illegally engaging in this act of genocide, this ethnic cleansing campaign. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2543.36s)]
*  But outside of that, Israel is a very entitled actor in the global stage as well. And it seems [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2549.2000000000003s)]
*  like even whenever Israel feels betrayed or whenever Israel feels unsafe or angry, I feel [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2554.88s)]
*  like the Palestinian population is punished the most. They are significantly more restrained when [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2562.96s)]
*  it comes to their retaliation to Iran, for example, as opposed to their retaliation or even [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2567.52s)]
*  as opposed to their retaliation in Southern Lebanon, which was obviously not as restrained [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2575.84s)]
*  as Iran, but significantly more restrained in comparison to Gaza. And it's obvious that [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2579.92s)]
*  incurring penalties for their actions is what is the only lesson Israel responds to, is the only [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2587.68s)]
*  language Israel responds to. Having said all of that, their actions that amounted to a hundred [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2593.84s)]
*  people being killed, including bombing multiple hospitals at this point, and they're open and [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2603.1200000000003s)]
*  deliberate targeting of Hassan, the journalist that you were talking about, and assassinating him, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2608.48s)]
*  and even assassinating a 12-year-old survivor, the 12-year-old survivor of the medical [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2614.88s)]
*  worker assassination that Israel had conducted. All of this happening in the last 48 hours, I think, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2624.0800000000004s)]
*  is because Israel is angry and frustrated that by the conclusion of this Trump trip into the Middle [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2631.28s)]
*  East that Trump may end up forcing them to stop this genocide, or at least have a more [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2638.8s)]
*  reasonable conclusion than what Israel's demands are, which is complete ethnic cleansing, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2650.1600000000003s)]
*  hostages being secondary, not even the extraction of hostages not even being a main focus now [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2655.44s)]
*  admitted by Benjamin Netanyahu. For all of these reasons, do you believe that the Trump [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2662.48s)]
*  administration, especially considering what Israel did after the Edan Alexander release, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2668.32s)]
*  the prisoner of war release for only a demonstration of good faith by Hamas and [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2674.08s)]
*  Israel's retaliation in the process, do you believe that the Trump administration is actually going to [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2680.32s)]
*  push for a long-term reasonable conclusion here, or do you think that it's going to turn into the [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2685.84s)]
*  previous ceasefire negotiation where eventually with enough pressure from Israeli envoys, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2691.68s)]
*  Steve Witkoff will mold the existing ceasefire structure to one that suits the Israeli narrative, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2697.12s)]
*  and we just put Gaza on the back burner once again as Israel continues its ethnic cleansing campaign? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2704.48s)]
*  I mean, this is a... you raised a lot of one central thing you're asking me, which is to sort of [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2710.72s)]
*  speculate or give an educated guess, which I'm not in the business of doing, but I will share with [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2716.88s)]
*  you some thoughts based on all the things you put on the table there. I think the most likely [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2722.7200000000003s)]
*  scenario in the short term... first of all, there always is the possibility that Trump decides, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2729.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to let it keep burning for another period. I created enough momentum around this [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2737.44s)]
*  and discussion, and I had Bowler and Witkoff in Qatar, and Hamas is being obstructionist, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2743.52s)]
*  and they're not agreeing, and that may even be the most likely thing, that Israel just continues [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  forward with its scorched earth bombing, and then they try to pull off this so-called humanitarian [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2753.92s)]
*  aid program that Trump and Netanyahu have been kicking around that involves American mercenaries [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2761.44s)]
*  and a fake sort of foundation that's being created, and Netanyahu is saying that they're [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2766.64s)]
*  already issuing more forced displacement orders, including in the area around El Shifa Hospital [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2773.76s)]
*  tonight, which anytime Israel does this, it's followed by horrifying bombings. So what may [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2778.5600000000004s)]
*  be the most likely scenario is not much happens, that Netanyahu then intensifies the attacks further. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2786.4s)]
*  They try to push hundreds of thousands of Palestinians once again, cram them into an [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2792.5600000000004s)]
*  ever-shrinking killing cage in the South, put this dystopic aid distribution plan in place [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2796.88s)]
*  that has no tie whatsoever to a ceasefire, and you just have a continuation of the war of [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2803.92s)]
*  annihilation for another several weeks, several months, until there's some momentum or some reason [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2809.44s)]
*  why Trump gets interested in this again. That could happen. What I think is also possible [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2814.7200000000003s)]
*  is that we're not going to have a comprehensive deal emerge out of the discussions happening [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2820.32s)]
*  right now in Qatar, but you might have Israel having to concede to create a longer period of [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2826.88s)]
*  a short-term truce, and also there's going to be, Hamas will not agree to a short-term truce. They [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2834.32s)]
*  were very clear with me about this, unless it has a path to a framework that has clearly defined [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2839.92s)]
*  terms for ending the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas actually has shown [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2846.88s)]
*  quite a bit of flexibility on a number of issues, but they've said that they have a couple of red [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2855.76s)]
*  lines. One is no more short-term truces, no more captives being exchanged, unless there is a [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2860.1600000000003s)]
*  guarantee by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt that this leads back to a framework like the [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2868.4s)]
*  original January deal that says at a certain point, Israeli forces are all out of Gaza and [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2874.08s)]
*  the war comes to an end, and then Gaza can go through reconstruction with Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2879.84s)]
*  not with Palestinians shipped to Somaliland or whatever fantasies Netanyahu is thinking about. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2885.7599999999998s)]
*  It's possible that we're going to see something that is not great, but does pause the genocide, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2890.56s)]
*  and maybe instead of it being 40 days, it's going to be 70 days or 90 days. Then the scramble will [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2897.84s)]
*  become, how do you now prevent Netanyahu from just doing what he said he's going to do, which is even [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2904.48s)]
*  if we sign an agreement, I'm going to go back in when that agreement is done and burn Gaza back to [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2909.6s)]
*  the ground again and again and again, and keep pummeling an already dead body. Look what they're [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2914.2400000000002s)]
*  bombing. They're bombing places they've bombed. They're bombing people in tents. Israeli reporting [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2919.92s)]
*  today indicated that of the almost 3,000 people that are confirmed to have been killed since March [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2926.24s)]
*  18th, these are civilians, uninvolved combatants. It's even by Israeli media standards that the IDF [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2930.72s)]
*  is indicating this. We're witnessing something so unspeakable, Hassan, so unspeakable in the [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2936.7999999999997s)]
*  world right now that we all should be ashamed that this isn't what we're consumed with every waking [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2943.6s)]
*  moment. Maybe there is going to be some deal. Maybe Trump's pressure is going to be [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2949.3599999999997s)]
*  saying to Netanyahu, you are going to concede on these two issues and we're going to kick this [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2955.6000000000004s)]
*  issue of Hamas disarmament down the road that you keep insisting on. Because the other point that [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2961.44s)]
*  Hamas makes is they're not just trying to take Hamas' weapons. They know that there's been a [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2966.32s)]
*  massive degradation of the weapons in the hands of the resistance. And let me remind people, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2971.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you have a smart audience, but let me remind people, most of the weapons used by the [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2975.76s)]
*  Palestinian resistance are manufactured, they're making their own bullets. They're making their [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2980.0s)]
*  own sniper rifles. They're making their own grenades. They're making their own rockets. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2984.0s)]
*  The October 7th attacks were spectacular. Under a complete embargo, mind you. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2989.28s)]
*  Right, under a complete embargo. And one of the spectacular, and I mean this in a kind of historical [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2993.92s)]
*  context, aspects of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood was that it was done with technology that was domestic [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=2998.96s)]
*  within Gaza. Overwhelmingly, the weapons that were used in the single most devastating attack [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3007.36s)]
*  against Israel since the 1948 Nakba, which by the way, we're now recognizing Nakba Day, the [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3013.76s)]
*  creation of the State of Israel and the beginning of the campaign of mass expulsion and extermination [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3021.5200000000004s)]
*  of the Palestinians. So, you know, when we talk about Hamas disarmament, Israel knows [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3026.32s)]
*  that this is an outrageous issue to raise, that they're putting Hamas in a position of then [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3032.32s)]
*  pretending that they're saying, well, we're not going to put down our guns. Hamas is in fact [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3037.92s)]
*  saying we're not going to put down our guns, but they're not saying it as like the Hamas militia. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3041.36s)]
*  But Hamas' point is every point in history when the Palestinians have agreed to any form of [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3045.6800000000003s)]
*  disarmament, it's followed by them getting slaughtered by the Israelis. And by the way, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3050.6400000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu is not just saying Qassam Brigades and Saraya al-Quds, the armed wing of Islamic Jihad, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3054.96s)]
*  that they have to put down their weapons. Netanyahu is insisting on a demilitarization [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3060.32s)]
*  of the entire Gaza Strip. That is the end of the Palestinian liberation struggle if there is [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3064.1600000000003s)]
*  demilitarization of the Palestinian resistance. You know, whatever anyone thinks about Hamas [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3069.44s)]
*  or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the issue of the right to armed resistance against Israel remains [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3074.4s)]
*  one of the most popular issues in all public opinion polls across the Palestinian spectrum. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3081.04s)]
*  So he says you must disarm and Hamas must leave Gaza. Okay, Hamas says, look, we don't need to be [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3087.36s)]
*  the government in Gaza. In fact, I've had multiple Hamas officials say to me, it is an albatross [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3093.04s)]
*  around our neck that we're the government. These guys were elected in 2006. And then there haven't [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3098.08s)]
*  been elections since then. And you've got crooked old Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3104.08s)]
*  Authority, who has single digit popularity ratings, who's widely viewed as a collaborator [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3109.68s)]
*  with Israel. Yeah, firmly a part of the security apparatus. And also the deputy. Yeah. And the [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3115.12s)]
*  second least popular entity in the region, according to Palestinians after Israel, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3122.72s)]
*  like very close in its unpopularity to Israel. And remember, as Gaza is burning, the war against [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3127.04s)]
*  the Palestinians of the West Bank has been escalating, not just from armed settlers backed [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3134.8799999999997s)]
*  and facilitated by the Israeli state, but also the Palestinian Authority security forces cleared the [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3139.3599999999997s)]
*  way attacking Palestinian resistance forces for then an Israeli invasion, the most significant [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3145.8399999999997s)]
*  forced displacement campaign since 1967 has been underway in the occupied West Bank. And it was [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3152.32s)]
*  aided and abetted by Mahmoud Abbas. So what is happening in Gaza is that Hamas has been the [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3158.2400000000002s)]
*  government for two decades and people were fed up with basic governance in Gaza even before October [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3167.44s)]
*  7th. One Hamas official said to me lately, can you imagine what happens in our society when we [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3174.7200000000003s)]
*  don't meet payroll, when we don't pay people on time, when the trash is piling up? It's the same, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3180.4s)]
*  Palestinians are the same as everybody in the world. Most people are not generally [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3186.32s)]
*  too happy with their government. So from their perspective, they're saying we don't need to be [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3190.1600000000003s)]
*  the government. But what's going to happen is that Israel has painted Hamas with such a broad brush [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3194.0s)]
*  and the US has bought this line, hook line and sinker. And so as much of the Western press, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3200.1600000000003s)]
*  that at the end of the day, when you say we're getting rid of Hamas, it's the same level of [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3204.48s)]
*  brilliance that existed when George W. Bush and Dick Cheney invaded Iraq and did their [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3208.72s)]
*  debathification program. When you fire all of the civil servants because they happen to have been [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3214.0s)]
*  affiliated with the former government's political party or the single party system that existed in [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3220.16s)]
*  Iraq, that means you're firing the teachers, you're firing the postal workers, you're firing [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3225.8399999999997s)]
*  the doctors in many cases, you're firing the people that are the paper pushers that nobody [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3230.8799999999997s)]
*  ever thanks or sees what they do. That's what we're talking about here. So Hamas is saying, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3235.36s)]
*  okay, who you think is going to be competent. But at the end of the day, you're going to come [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3239.44s)]
*  and ask us because we've been the only government there since 2006. So that issue also is a red [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3244.1600000000003s)]
*  herring. Speaking of George W. Bush, ironically enough, that election was conducted against [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3250.7200000000003s)]
*  the wishes of the Palestinian Authority in 2006, which understood how unpopular they had become [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3257.44s)]
*  due to their consistent collaboration with the Israeli state and due to the failures of the [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3262.88s)]
*  ceasefire, the so-called peace talks with Israel and what that had yielded for the Palestinians in [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3266.56s)]
*  the West Bank, which was bantustans forming due to settlements propping up all over the West Bank. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3273.84s)]
*  And that was a Bush gift as well to force an election in all of historic occupied Palestine, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3283.52s)]
*  which of course, Hamas was seen as a anti-corruption party, which led them to win [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3293.84s)]
*  over the Palestinian Authority and Fatah. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3301.84s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up because remember that Ismail Haniya, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3306.0s)]
*  who was assassinated last summer in Tehran, Iran, who was the political [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3313.6s)]
*  leader of Hamas for a very, very long time, was supposed to be the Prime Minister of Palestine. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3319.36s)]
*  And there was a civil war between Hamas and Fatah and Hamas consolidated its control of Gaza, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3327.76s)]
*  had international sanctions imposed. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3336.2400000000002s)]
*  American-facilitated coup d'etat. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3337.44s)]
*  Yeah, and the United States and other Western countries decided very swiftly that an election [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3338.88s)]
*  that actually Jimmy Carter had observers on the ground for, that the wrong people won the free [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3348.0s)]
*  and fair election. And so we're going to punish them. We're going to collectively punish them. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3353.92s)]
*  That's when they implement this sweeping blockade around Gaza. They start the [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3358.48s)]
*  policy of intense collective punishment. And Hamas had been criticized by some other [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3362.0s)]
*  resistance factions for standing in those elections. For instance, Palestinian Islamic [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3369.04s)]
*  Jihad has taken a position, and I've twice interviewed the number two figure in Palestinian [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3374.0s)]
*  Islamic Jihad, who's actually a pediatrician by training Dr. Muhammad al-Hindi. And Palestinian [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3379.68s)]
*  Islamic Jihad will not participate in elections organized by what it considers to be an illegitimate [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3386.16s)]
*  entity, which is the Palestinian Authority. But they are very much a part of the body politic, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3391.36s)]
*  the fabric of Palestinian society. And another more basic point, Hassan, that seldom goes unmentioned, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3396.48s)]
*  Hamas is not some foreign entity that descended on Gaza. These are people of the community. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3405.2000000000003s)]
*  These are the men who are in the Qassam Brigades, or in Saraya al-Quds, are fathers and sons and [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3413.4399999999996s)]
*  daughters and brothers of Palestinian families. And Osama Hamdan shared with me, he's a senior [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3422.48s)]
*  official in Hamas, he was telling me just about his relatives. Some are in Fatah, some are in [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3431.6s)]
*  PFLP, some are not in any political affiliation. And he was just talking about how there's such a [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3437.36s)]
*  cartoonish way in which Palestinians are talked about. And he's like, ask me, do you have relatives [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3444.2400000000002s)]
*  that voted for Trump? And I said, yeah. And he said, but why aren't Palestinians allowed to have [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3448.88s)]
*  that complexity in our family lives either? It's a good question, it's a fair question that he asked [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3453.6s)]
*  me. So when we talk about this, there is an internal Palestinian, what Hamas is, whether [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3459.6800000000003s)]
*  people want them to be the government, and that's for Palestinians to decide. But what we're [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3466.32s)]
*  watching is a lie-filled narrative that distorts facts, that necessitates a portrayal of Hamas [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3472.6400000000003s)]
*  as being so beyond the pale, akin to Al-Qaeda and ISIS, that the only solution then is to mass [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3480.56s)]
*  murder everyone. So when Israel says Hamas must leave Gaza, what does that mean? You're talking [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3487.92s)]
*  about potentially then the families of everybody has to go? What does it mean to expel? These are [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3495.2s)]
*  not serious ideas that Netanyahu is putting up. These are ideas intended to justify the forced [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3501.7599999999998s)]
*  mass expulsion or murder of every Palestinian in Gaza. If Hamas was to say, we will agree to [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3508.3999999999996s)]
*  demilitarize the Gaza Strip, they would essentially be surrendering on behalf of 76 years of Palestinian [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3515.04s)]
*  history and people. And it's why the most recent public opinion polling of Palestinians in both [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3522.32s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank has shown that most Palestinians support Hamas's position in the [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3527.6000000000004s)]
*  negotiations on issues such as disarmament and issues such as surrendering to the Israelis or [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3533.04s)]
*  making a deal to release the captives without a firm deal to end the genocide. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3541.04s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned this already, but Hamas or the Al-Qassam Brigades are almost entirely [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3547.6800000000003s)]
*  comprised of orphaned soldiers. The reality of the matter is as long as Israel keeps killing the [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3555.2000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian population, there will always be an understandable moral obligation and a legal one [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3561.36s)]
*  to resist against such actions from the indigenous population. This is a reality that Israeli military [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3566.56s)]
*  officials have recognized. This is a reality that former Israeli prime ministers have recognized. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3574.08s)]
*  This is a reality that Shembet officials have recognized as well. They have a legal right to [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3579.36s)]
*  resist against this unjustifiable occupation that is conducting a genocide right now. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3584.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think going back to the importance of your journalism, the importance of journalism in general [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3592.16s)]
*  that seeks out the truth by talking to the groups that are considered terrorists by the state. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3599.04s)]
*  I wanted to juxtapose your work with the way that the current mainstream press and legacy media [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3607.44s)]
*  operates, where I think they play a very, I think they play a formative role in trying to get Americans [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3614.96s)]
*  to consistently refuse their better judgment when they see dead children on their timeline, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3622.16s)]
*  on their social media feeds or all of the pain that Palestinians are subjected to by trying to [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3630.48s)]
*  create this unworkable position where some Americans will recognize that there is a genocide going on [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3638.16s)]
*  and it's heinous, but also simultaneously say, well, any kind of group resisting against said [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3644.56s)]
*  genocide is actually wrong still and that you shouldn't even talk to them and that the discussion [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3651.12s)]
*  should never revolve around them behaving as rational actors, let alone rational actors [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3656.96s)]
*  with a, regardless of tactics, rational actors with an overarching, desirable goal to end [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3663.3599999999997s)]
*  this occupation and to end this genocide. And that is something in the beginning when you talked [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3672.88s)]
*  about how Western press will often immediately demand Hamas condemn its own campaigns or its [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3679.2s)]
*  own operations or itself. And I feel like this is thought terminating and it's somewhat successful. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3687.68s)]
*  That's why you arrive at people that on the one hand will say, yeah, what Israel's doing is really [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3695.6s)]
*  messed up, but you know who's really also messed up? Hamas. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3700.08s)]
*  This is the whole history of armed resistance against established power or against colonialism [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3702.56s)]
*  or against apartheid that you must portray anyone who uses armed force to try to overthrow your [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3714.56s)]
*  system of oppression is a terrorist. I mean, this is also the way that black Americans who rebelled [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3725.84s)]
*  by force of arms against slavery were characterized at the time. It's how indigenous [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3733.6000000000004s)]
*  people in the United States were characterized by European settler colonialists who began to [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3739.28s)]
*  expand their occupation of native lands in the United States. It's a story as old as war itself. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3744.96s)]
*  And so, you know, when I look at the history of Palestinian resistance, you look at the [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3752.08s)]
*  evolution of thinking, the evolution of tactics. You know, Hamas and Islamic Jihad are relatively [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3760.4s)]
*  new to the Palestinian resistance scene because this has been going on for so long, for so many [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3766.56s)]
*  decades. And, you know, large chunks of the story of Palestinian resistance involves secular-oriented [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3774.1600000000003s)]
*  Palestinian nationalists or liberation fighters. And part of what happened is that, you know, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3782.8s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad started to rise up out of a period where Israel had expelled and exiled [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3789.6s)]
*  all of these Palestinian resistance figures, including people like Dr. Muhammad al-Hindi, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3796.4s)]
*  who I've interviewed from Palestinian Islamic Jihad. And they kind of put them all in the same [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3801.2s)]
*  place in the camps in Lebanon and in the heady times in the Islamic world. And well, then there's [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3805.7599999999998s)]
*  also that component, which is that they're constantly assassinating any Palestinian that [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3813.04s)]
*  rises up and has an ability to be a uniter of the Palestinian cause. It's why Marwan Barghouti [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3817.3599999999997s)]
*  continues to rot in a prison cell because the Israelis fear that that figure who is not from [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3824.08s)]
*  Hamas, he's actually from Fatah, but he's number one on Hamas's list of prisoners that they want [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3830.0s)]
*  freed in these exchanges and has been from the very beginning. That terrifies Israel. And that's [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3835.76s)]
*  why Israel assassinates and imprisons Palestinians that it believes pose a threat to its colonial [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3840.72s)]
*  apartheid occupation regime. But the story of Palestinian resistance [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3846.88s)]
*  is not one of terrorism. It's one of justifiable armed insurrection against a settler colonial state. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3852.64s)]
*  And there are chapters in that story that you can talk about and say, well, what about [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3861.7599999999998s)]
*  blowing yourself up on a bus full of civilians? You could have debates about those tactics. And [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3868.48s)]
*  right now is not the time to do that, but certainly those are relevant discussions to have. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3874.24s)]
*  But I'm sorry. That's one tree in the forest. The forest is a story of a people who were punished [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3878.48s)]
*  because of Germany's mass murder of Jews and other minorities in Europe. And Western [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3888.16s)]
*  powers decided that they were going to steal the land from the Palestinians and impose a European [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3896.8s)]
*  colonial settler state on that territory. And then they were going to say, we're going to demonize [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3905.12s)]
*  anyone who was indigenous to the land that dares to challenge what we've just done to them. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3913.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what the British did to the Irish. That's what the settlers did to the indigenous Native [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3919.52s)]
*  American population. That is the story of colonialism and the story of armed resistance. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3925.68s)]
*  So don't believe this is an epic lie. In these past 19 months and these past 77 years, an epic [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3930.64s)]
*  lie has been told about the motivations and political objectives of the Palestinian resistance. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3937.2s)]
*  Their objective is self-determination. Their objective is to expel occupiers. Their objective [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3942.96s)]
*  is to achieve the same rights of any people on this planet. That's their objective. You can debate [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3948.48s)]
*  tactics. That's fine. That's legitimate. But let's not pretend that that is the story. The story is [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3953.68s)]
*  the genocidal regime that is mass murdering Palestinians right now because they've had the [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3959.04s)]
*  audacity to commit an act of resistance, which as a Palestinian means you've taken a breath on planet [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3962.72s)]
*  earth. You've dared to live. Yeah. Also, one important part of this conversation, actually, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3967.6s)]
*  because we talked about the vague definitions of terrorism, is the historic usage of terrorism [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3974.08s)]
*  most commonly is talked about with respect to the war on terror, the anti-Muslim thrust of war on [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3979.84s)]
*  terror policies. But that was built on top of a pre-existing foundation. And its inception point [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3987.76s)]
*  is the Palestinian liberation struggle. As a matter of fact, the earliest mention of terrorism [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=3994.7200000000003s)]
*  in a federal statute was in 1969. And it dealt specifically with restricting humanitarian aid [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4000.7200000000003s)]
*  to Palestinians and inaugurated a pattern of rendering Palestinians synonymous with terrorism. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4006.1600000000003s)]
*  So as early as 1969 was the first mention of this term in American, in the American legal setting, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4012.4s)]
*  and it was directed towards Palestinian liberation organizations. So it has been going on for quite a [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4022.32s)]
*  long time. And it's important to recognize that because now a lot of people that are [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4030.0s)]
*  learning about Palestinian liberation and its history will look back at the PLO and its efforts, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4036.0800000000004s)]
*  will look back at the Palestinian Liberation Front, or look back at PFLP, DFLP, and its leadership [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4041.28s)]
*  that was Western aligned, or even aligned during the Cold War with the USSR at certain points, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4047.44s)]
*  and say, oh, why can't they have guys like this? Why do they have scary fundamentalist Muslims, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4053.6800000000003s)]
*  which Hamas is always often portrayed as? And so is Hezbollah, and so are the Houthis. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4059.0400000000004s)]
*  And regardless of their religious perspective, obviously, they still are comprised of very [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4065.84s)]
*  well-read individuals who are rational actors in this process. They're not operating off of like [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4073.2000000000003s)]
*  this unrestrained anti-Semitism. That is just a lie that the United States has told, the State [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4080.48s)]
*  Department has told over and over again. And that is a lie that is trafficked through [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4088.48s)]
*  all forms of media, through the permissible ways of talking about Palestinian liberation. That's [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4093.8399999999997s)]
*  just a way to tarnish a justifiable demand for emancipation from Palestinians. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4099.2s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's also in, if you study or research the history of some of the key figures [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4109.68s)]
*  that were responsible for October 7th, or that have emerged over the course of these past 19 [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4119.84s)]
*  months as figures that the world knows about, you look at Yahya Sanwar, who was born in a refugee [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4125.2s)]
*  camp, and his entire life, you can draw an arc of the escalation of Israel's terror attacks [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4131.68s)]
*  against the Palestinians of Gaza and his political development, his intellectual development, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4138.32s)]
*  how he came to see what Israel is in the world, why he conceived of the, you know, that he spent [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4143.6s)]
*  22 years in prison, he became fluent in Hebrew, he studied the enemy in prison, he translated by hand [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4150.08s)]
*  the memoirs of former heads of Shin Bet from Hebrew into Arabic and distributed it, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4157.52s)]
*  and distributed these texts to other Palestinian prisoners, telling them we need to study this. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4164.0s)]
*  Mohammed Daif, who was widely credited with being the most central figure in the modernization of [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4171.2s)]
*  al-Qassam brigades as a fighting force capable of doing an operation like October 7th, all of [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4178.96s)]
*  these guys, or when you speak to Hamas officials and you ask them about their family history, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4184.96s)]
*  all of them have a story that begins as a child witnessing the humiliation or the killing of close [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4190.08s)]
*  family members, and when you start to, these people that are demonized in the media, and you actually [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4198.08s)]
*  are about the business of being intellectually honest, and you say where does a Yahya Sinwar come [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4204.64s)]
*  from? Where does a Mohammed Daif come from? Who is Abu Obeda, the spokesperson for the al-Qassam [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4210.24s)]
*  brigades, who's one of the most recognizable voices now in the Arab world when it comes to the [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4216.08s)]
*  situation in Gaza? When you start to understand their history, you're really studying the history [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4220.72s)]
*  of Palestinian resistance, and you're studying the history of a gratuitous, violent enemy that [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4226.56s)]
*  believes in the extermination of those people, and then you start to say, well, let's look at this [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4232.0s)]
*  from a different angle. Let's look at this in a very big sense. What is right and what is wrong [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4236.72s)]
*  here? Are the Palestinians terrorists? Is it terrorism to have grown up in a concentration [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4241.52s)]
*  camp where your family members are systematically killed and humiliated? Is that terrorism, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4247.68s)]
*  or is there a deeper discourse that we should be engaged in? And that's how Palestinians have [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4253.28s)]
*  always been portrayed, and the United States and Western journalism has been a major player in [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4260.08s)]
*  promoting lethal myths about the Palestinian people. Again, there's all kinds of debates that [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4267.599999999999s)]
*  can be had about Hamas, about tactics, about what happened on October 7th. And that's all [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4273.679999999999s)]
*  they have had these discussions. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4280.08s)]
*  But that's all they want to talk about. But that's all they want to talk about. No one wants to talk [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4280.96s)]
*  about, do the Palestinians have a right to use force to get rid of a Western-backed, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4284.96s)]
*  genocidal, colonial apartheid regime? If your answer to that question is no, they don't have [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4290.0s)]
*  that right, you're not a serious person. You're not a student of history, and you're just a [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4294.4s)]
*  propagandist for one of the most heinous crimes we've witnessed in our lifetime. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4298.88s)]
*  Yeah. Two things I want to mention here, giving more historical context to this as well, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4303.36s)]
*  other friend of the show and also Palestine historian Zachary Foster, who, HD in Princeton, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4309.679999999999s)]
*  has written extensively on the Palestinian militancy, specifically lasering in on Hamas [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4318.0s)]
*  and its tactics, and how its tactics have evolved, where he says the violence committed by the [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4325.5199999999995s)]
*  Israeli military in Gaza during the first year of the Intifada, where 142 Palestinians were killed [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4333.04s)]
*  and zero Israelis were killed, was the same time that Hamas officially transitioned from a [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4337.52s)]
*  charity organization because it was an Islamic charity, a Muslim Brotherhood cut out that simply [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4341.76s)]
*  worked in charitable works, and it turned into a militant group. And even then, its tactics were not [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4347.84s)]
*  the ones that Israel recognizes and associates Hamas with. The militant violence was almost [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4354.72s)]
*  entirely still directed towards the members of the military and police forces within Israel. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4364.08s)]
*  And then, after the second Intifada, or before the second Intifada rather, given the very famous [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4372.24s)]
*  act of terror conducted by a kahanist terrorist, Baruch Goldstein, that was when the Palestinian [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4380.48s)]
*  resistance, or at least some militant factions within the Palestinian resistance, including Hamas, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4388.8s)]
*  started changing their tactics to also target civilians. And it's the same standard that exists [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4393.52s)]
*  always in any kind of liberation movement, where the standard of violence is always maintained by [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4401.360000000001s)]
*  the oppressive force here. The colonial entity is what dictates what kind of violence exists [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4410.400000000001s)]
*  as retaliation for the endless amount of violence that it subjects its colonial subjects to. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4418.08s)]
*  And that is the reason why that standard has evolved over 76, 77 years at this point, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4425.52s)]
*  and has turned into the final culmination of October 7. But having this conversation, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4432.56s)]
*  or trying to have an academic conversation around like militant resistance, especially in a setting [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4439.36s)]
*  such as this one, is completely not allowed. Like this conversation that I'm having, many people [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4445.12s)]
*  do not want me to have. They want to simply say, what you are saying is insane, you are crazy, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4452.88s)]
*  you're a terrorist, you're offering material support to terror groups, and you should be banned, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4458.48s)]
*  or maybe even criminally punished for this. You know, it should be... The idiocy of the line that [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4463.76s)]
*  this is material support is almost not even worth a response. But what I would say is, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4473.84s)]
*  if you actually believe in a free press, and you want journalists to serve a function of providing [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4480.56s)]
*  the public with information that they can use to make informed decisions, then you want journalists [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4487.84s)]
*  to talk to every possible player in every story that you can. And so, you know, I reject fundamentally [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4493.2s)]
*  the notion that by interviewing people that are designated as enemies, that we're committing some [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4503.12s)]
*  crime. The crime that we're committing is called journalism. And if that's a crime, then let a [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4508.32s)]
*  thousand million journalists bloom. I mean, we should be speaking to everybody. You know, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4514.24s)]
*  it's one aspect of Trump that I really do respect, that he is willing to authorize his administration [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4520.72s)]
*  to speak, apparently, with almost anyone. He directly meets with Abu Muhammad al-Jalani, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4528.32s)]
*  Ahmad al-Shada, who, you know, State Department designated terrorist, was ISIS, was al-Qaeda, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4534.639999999999s)]
*  you know. He's talking to Ansarullah, he's talking to Hamas. That's what a sane, rational country [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4540.719999999999s)]
*  should be doing. We should be favoring diplomacy. We should be trying to not have wars. Now, there's [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4549.5199999999995s)]
*  a whole other aspect to Trump where he'll do things like, you know, off-bombings of countries [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4555.2s)]
*  and drone strikes, et cetera. So, like, let's not pretend that he's, you know, some perfect character [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4559.5199999999995s)]
*  here. But the basic instinct of let's talk to people, let's go with that, because I actually [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4564.48s)]
*  think that that is one of the paths to peace in our world. But this accusation of material support [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4570.16s)]
*  because you're talking to people or you're explaining context or you're trying to correct [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4578.64s)]
*  the record is very dangerous, particularly because of what's happening in the United States [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4583.04s)]
*  right now, where there is this attempt to criminalize criticism of Israel and to conflate [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4587.12s)]
*  criticism of Israel or Zionism with anti-Semitism and to try to make that, by fiat, the law of the [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4595.28s)]
*  land in the United States or by law, you know, there's enough Democrats that are down with this [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4603.12s)]
*  program that it becomes very, very dangerous. But at the end of the day, what you try to do with your [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4607.5199999999995s)]
*  show, what we try to do with our journalism is to not bend the knee ever to the powerful on any of [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4615.44s)]
*  these questions. And, you know, we respect our readers enough, as I know you respect your [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4621.919999999999s)]
*  audience enough, to let them make their own decisions. You know, our job is to talk to [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4628.4s)]
*  anyone that we believe has a story to tell that's relevant to the public interest. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4635.6s)]
*  And I'm going to continue doing that, because I think that that's basic journalism. And I wish [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4640.88s)]
*  that the New York Times was doing it. And I've had friends who work at the New York Times say to me, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4645.84s)]
*  this just isn't really allowed at the New York Times. We can talk to Hamas, but we're not allowed [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4651.92s)]
*  to really get into, you know, their perspective in that way. And there's a reason people don't [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4657.12s)]
*  want to do that. You know who targets civilians nonstop? Israel. You know who justifies the [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4662.56s)]
*  killing of civilians in the name of killing some former bureaucrat for Hamas? That's what they're [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4669.360000000001s)]
*  down to now. They're killing, they're whacking people that were in the civil government of Hamas [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4675.360000000001s)]
*  and then putting out press releases saying they've killed some important commander. And they're [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4679.68s)]
*  willing to kill as many women and children as happen to be in the area. And they specifically [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4683.6s)]
*  are targeting and murdering our colleagues, journalists, and their families, you know, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4688.32s)]
*  nonstop. So, you know, we want to talk about October 7th. 1300 people were killed that day. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4693.04s)]
*  And, you know, you had several hundred of them that were in the military or in security forces. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4700.48s)]
*  You had multiple Israeli military vases attacked. You had scored soldiers taking captive by the [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4708.4s)]
*  Palestinian resistance. And yet to this day, it's still portrayed as Hamas and Islamic Jihad [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4716.16s)]
*  went into Israel and kidnapped a bunch of innocent civilians and murdered 1300, although sometimes [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4722.5599999999995s)]
*  they exaggerate the number, murdered 1300 innocent civilians. Well, we should be fact checking that. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4731.36s)]
*  It's not that there weren't a substantial number of civilians killed out of that number. That's true. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4739.12s)]
*  Yes, I've watched the video. I'm very well aware of the scope of events, but let's not pretend [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4744.48s)]
*  that that that that operation was not at its inception, targeting Israeli military bases that [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4750.96s)]
*  are responsible for the siege, the blockade, the surveillance, the mowing of the lawn, the bombing [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4758.24s)]
*  of Gaza. Let's have an honest debate about that. Let's not shy away from it and just [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4763.68s)]
*  defer to the narrative because we're afraid of being called pro this or pro that. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4769.04s)]
*  We have to have an honest discussion about it. And yes, it includes a video of the clear, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4773.36s)]
*  intentional killing of civilians. That is absolutely part of the story. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4779.679999999999s)]
*  And if we had a real international criminal court that was willing to actually go after [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4785.839999999999s)]
*  war criminals, regardless of their status or power or nationality, then we could have an actual [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4793.92s)]
*  discussion not just about the events of October 7th and about the role of armed resistance and [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4799.36s)]
*  what happens when civilians are killed in those kinds of operations, but also let's talk about [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4804.4s)]
*  the genocide. Let's talk about what Israel did. Let's talk about the minimum 60,000 people, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4808.96s)]
*  probably far greater than that that have been killed. And let's talk about a country that [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4813.759999999999s)]
*  openly, gleefully dehumanizes Palestinians, starves them and portrays Palestinian children [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4817.44s)]
*  as terrorists ready to grow up. Or 77 years of an apartheid structure. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4824.0s)]
*  Sorry to cut you off. 77 years of an apartheid, which is also illegal. I mean, that is, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4830.24s)]
*  and it's taken many different violent forms because the maintenance of an apartheid is already [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4836.799999999999s)]
*  an inherently violent endeavor. The, we, especially liberals in the West, like have no way of defining [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4841.36s)]
*  violence as anything outside of non-state entities where the permanent violence that people are [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4851.2s)]
*  subjected to by supposedly legal entities is always seen as something entirely different. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4856.8s)]
*  And the resistance against said violence is actually seen as criminal, as seen as inappropriate, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4863.76s)]
*  as seen as completely unjustifiable because the state de facto has a monopoly of violence. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4868.64s)]
*  And in this circumstance, Israel gets to use its own legal structure to continue, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4874.320000000001s)]
*  to continue enforcing this cruel regime upon the indigenous population of Palestinians. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4881.6s)]
*  Yeah. It's, it's, I don't know how much more time you have. I know it's late over there, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4887.68s)]
*  but this was a, I have to roll. I love being with you, man, but I got, I gotta roll. I know this was [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4891.92s)]
*  a, this was an incredibly enlightening conversation. Thank you so much, Jeremy, for coming on as always. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4896.64s)]

*  respect for a person whose journalism and a person whose work has guided my worldview and have been [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE_ixAK_XtY&t=4972.88s)]
