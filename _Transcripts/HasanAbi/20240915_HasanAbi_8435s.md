*  And now you want to damn now you want control. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=0.0s)]
*  How are you going to turn around and be like, oh, an assault style, an assault [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  style, a high powered assault style with a long barrel was near the vicinity [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=7.2s)]
*  of our president or a big, beautiful president, Donald Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=10.48s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=12.48s)]
*  We need to do something about this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  How is this happening? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=14.6s)]
*  Damn Hannity. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=16.28s)]
*  I thought we were, I thought we were on board. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=17.2s)]
*  I thought we were up dog. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=19.28s)]
*  I thought you were a real one. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=20.28s)]
*  One. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=22.6s)]
*  We're definitely doing that because he just openly admits that he just lies for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=23.0s)]
*  fun. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=26.6s)]
*  He lies for attention, which is crazy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=26.8s)]
*  He's just like, yeah, I'm that I'm that I lie for attention. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=30.800000000000004s)]
*  Don't forget. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  Laura Loomer is younger than a son. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  Laura Loomer is younger than me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=37.2s)]
*  Many people are asking. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=38.8s)]
*  Many people are thinking about not voting for Trump anymore because of the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=39.8s)]
*  inappropriate, inappropriate, inappropriate, inappropriate, inappropriate [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  age gap between Laura Loomer, Laura Loomer, baby Gronk and Donald Trump are in an [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=48.8s)]
*  inappropriate age gap relationship. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=54.8s)]
*  But to all the critics that have said Laura Loomer is rizzing up Donnie J. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=56.8s)]
*  Donnie J has said Laura is a fiery woman and also that Laura kind of looks a lot [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=62.0s)]
*  older than she actually is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=69.6s)]
*  I get why you have haters now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=71.8s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=73.4s)]
*  I get why you have haters now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=75.0s)]
*  I don't know why this is what too much take talk those two people that guy always [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  looks so sad like the I think I'm nailing the cadence. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=81.0s)]
*  But like every time every time he talks about it literally feels like he is being [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=85.4s)]
*  punished by God for that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=91.9s)]
*  He committed in a past life. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't know his face is so sad all the time where he's like, what have I become [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=95.2s)]
*  like I spend I spend the finite amount of time I have on this planet covering baby [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=101.2s)]
*  Gronk like that's what's going on in the back of his dome when he's talking about [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=108.0s)]
*  that do more brain rot news coverage. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  It might actually work. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=113.4s)]
*  Who are you talking about the pain in your eyes isn't quite there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=115.2s)]
*  All right, let's see what the CNN is saying the alleged but that's not what we have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=118.4s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=122.0s)]
*  And again, as chief Ramsey pointed out and chief Ramsey's been around a long time [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=122.7s)]
*  and he's lived this experience. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  The first story is never right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=129.89999999999998s)]
*  But what we believe that the information we're getting from our sources, which is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=131.7s)]
*  the flash reporting coming from law enforcement on the scene is going to be a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  pretty close composite to how this unfolded then will have to be processed for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  DNA for fingerprints. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  So what what the practice that I've always used at the scene that my colleagues [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  always use that the scene is if they fell with the with the serial number facing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=152.5s)]
*  up, you know to take a picture of it and then not to handle that at all because [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  you don't want to add any biological material or disturb it before the lab [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  people get to it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  You want to give it to them as pristinely as possible. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you so much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=171.5s)]
*  I want to bring in senior justice correspondent Evan Perez, who's with us now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=172.5s)]
*  You have more information on someone detained. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=176.2s)]
*  That's right Fred. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  The the authorities there to get service on the scene were able to detain the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  person now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=185.1s)]
*  You know, obviously as John just read just, you know, making reference, you know, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  a lot of this is very early information from law enforcement law. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=190.9s)]
*  At times it's you know, it's just a heat of the moment and they're trying to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=193.5s)]
*  report what they have at the scene. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=197.5s)]
*  But at this point what they're what they're saying is that they've detained a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=199.0s)]
*  person now it they believe this is a person who was connected to this to the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  scene and you know, the reason why they were shot. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  Oh, I don't get it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=210.4s)]
*  Like Americans Americans love their it seems like everyone's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=211.3s)]
*  got a okay. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=215.8s)]
*  It seems like every goddamn American has a and they're just so ass at shooting. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=217.4s)]
*  Okay, how is that possible? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=222.5s)]
*  We got our cleaned out by Koreans an old 52 year old Turkish man, like they [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=224.8s)]
*  don't even have in their country and they were much better shots than us. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=232.8s)]
*  Okay at the Olympics and it's like we don't even have there's no zero good [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=237.10000000000002s)]
*  at the Olympics zero good in terms of political assassin attempts like look [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=244.9s)]
*  at Japan dog. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=250.0s)]
*  Those mom don't even have look at Japan. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=251.3s)]
*  They don't even have in that guy pulled one off. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=254.1s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=256.9s)]
*  Like this is not a political statement about like Donald Trump or anything [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=258.3s)]
*  like that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=262.6s)]
*  Okay, it's just kind of shocking how bad Americans are at shooting because [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=263.6s)]
*  like at the end of the day like the goal of shooting is supposed to be [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=269.2s)]
*  like hitting a target and it's wild that like just bad Americans are just [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=273.9s)]
*  bad at shooting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=279.2s)]
*  It seems objectively like marksmanship is barely considered in the military. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, like what the I think we got far too invested in our like military [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  superiority. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=290.7s)]
*  Okay, like back in the day during World War two you had like female Red [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=291.7s)]
*  Army snipers, you know what I mean? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  told about like, you know, Russian snipers that just like sat in a clock [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=300.5s)]
*  tower and just like popped off and like and stayed in a position and like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=304.5s)]
*  stopped the forces from advancing for weeks on end, you know what I mean? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=310.2s)]
*  And like I feel like with America nowadays for us, basically we just you [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=315.0s)]
*  know, we get shot at we're in Afghanistan. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=322.0s)]
*  We're like holding up. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=324.4s)]
*  I don't know hash field or something. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=325.3s)]
*  We get shot at one of the dudes gets like they're shot off and then immediately [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=327.7s)]
*  they call in air support and they just spray an entire the they spray the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=332.4s)]
*  entire countryside and then they off with it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=338.5s)]
*  Like there's no there's no art to it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=340.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  There is no art to it at all. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=343.79999999999995s)]
*  Like we've gotten too invested in the fact that we have like air superiority [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=345.7s)]
*  over all of our enemies who are in sandals for the most part using the we [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  gave them like 20 30 40 years ago that like we're just not we don't even care. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=355.7s)]
*  We don't even care about shooting good active duty Navy here are calls. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=361.9s)]
*  They have a minimum, but if you don't get that they mark your score. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=366.3s)]
*  So you do pass and qualify you in the regardless even if you're good at [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  shooting or not. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=372.9s)]

*  I think but the guy just straight up walked up there. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=379.7s)]
*  No gear whatsoever. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=382.3s)]
*  He's like a 52 year old man and just popped one and moved away and it is crazy to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=383.4s)]
*  me that like it is crazy. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=388.2s)]
*  We're lazy as dude. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  There's no art in it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=391.2s)]
*  Like there's no art in like actually hitting your target. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=392.2s)]
*  Like nobody cares about this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=395.4s)]
*  Nobody cares about it unless it's a school. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=397.0s)]
*  That's it city who's being investigated to determine whether he was the person [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  involved in this the tracing of the might be come less critical if that suspect [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=404.4s)]
*  turns out to be a good suspect in this case if that suspect turns out to be not [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  the person involved then the tracing of the course and all of this will happen [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=416.6s)]
*  simultaneously become more critical Steve Moore. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=420.6s)]

*  correct. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=880.4s)]
*  It's completely what you're just said is just completely [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=881.3s)]

*  the background check. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=897.7s)]

*  the laws are in place. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=900.4000000000001s)]
*  I guess you have no issue with closing the loopholes on [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=902.0s)]
*  and advocating for Universal background checks for which [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=905.3000000000001s)]

*  The Trump breaking news pushed the misinformation back. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=922.4000000000001s)]
*  I knew it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=926.0s)]
*  I knew I knew this was going to happen. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=927.1s)]
*  I literally said I hope it doesn't push that back. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=929.7s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=932.3s)]

*  I guess I got to finish Wukong now. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=937.7s)]
*  No, you do need a background check for illegal transfer [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=939.3s)]
*  a personal transfer doesn't require a background check [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=941.7s)]
*  but acquiring one from an FL does conspiracy to push your [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=943.7s)]
*  segment back. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=947.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=948.2s)]
*  Can we still watch the talk to a podcast? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=949.4s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=950.9s)]
*  It premieres in six hours because CNN is just going to [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=951.7s)]
*  farm the Trump shooting all day White House both [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=954.3s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris and current President Biden [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=956.8s)]
*  are here in Washington DC. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=961.5999999999999s)]
*  They are not on the campaign trail. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=963.5999999999999s)]
*  They have no events on their public schedule. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=965.1999999999999s)]
*  We received a statement from a White House official early [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=968.4s)]
*  on in this incident just in the last hour expressing similar [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=971.9s)]
*  that they both had been brief and they both are relieved [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=976.3s)]
*  that he is safe notably that statement did not express [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=978.8s)]
*  what Vice President Harris did in her. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=982.4s)]
*  She added at the end has no place in America. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=985.1s)]
*  So certainly signifies as we learn more about this incident [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=987.6s)]
*  potentially what happened potentially what the motive is [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=991.3000000000001s)]
*  notable that the vice president here reiterating that should [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  not be in politics in America at this time Fred. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=998.4000000000001s)]
*  All right, so it's so funny what politicians are like. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1002.6s)]
*  I can't believe this like should not should have no place [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1004.9000000000001s)]
*  should have no place in in America is such a funny take [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1007.7s)]
*  because like it's literally everywhere. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1011.1s)]
*  The only place where it doesn't happen is like at the tippy [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1013.6999999999999s)]
*  top. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1016.8s)]
*  So I guess like maybe it's personalizing the fit like everyday [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1017.8s)]
*  Americans experience on a regular goddamn basis. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1021.5s)]
*  So for the first time it's like actually politicians that [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1024.7s)]
*  are experiencing it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1027.3999999999999s)]
*  That's the only difference here. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1028.8999999999999s)]
*  I love when politicians say like there's no place in politics [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1030.6s)]
*  is like what do you mean it happens everywhere all the time. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1032.8999999999999s)]
*  There's like a mass shooting every day in the United States [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1036.0s)]
*  of America. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1038.8999999999999s)]
*  You're basically just saying you guys are fine if you each [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1039.7s)]
*  other but if you try to shoot at us then all of a sudden [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1042.6s)]
*  whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on everybody calm down. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1045.1999999999998s)]
*  It's like no, that's the most American dude. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1048.6999999999998s)]
*  Okay, it's the most American, you know, maybe they're democratizing [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1051.5s)]
*  that for once like hey do something about it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1055.0s)]
*  Okay, here's a good idea. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1059.1s)]
*  If you're fearful do something about it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1061.5s)]
*  Maybe they'll be asked to actually do something about it [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1063.8s)]
*  now that it's like actually happening to them too. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1066.3999999999999s)]
*  You know all of a sudden they're not a school child going to [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1069.6000000000001s)]
*  school or a teacher or a random person at the grocery store [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1073.2s)]
*  or a mall. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1079.4s)]
*  So now they're like whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not supposed [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1081.0s)]
*  to happen to us. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1084.7s)]
*  That's all that is for me for me. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  That's all when I hear that when I hear a Democrat or a [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1089.4s)]
*  Republican when I hear politicians say there's no place [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1093.5s)]
*  in politics like they have to say that obviously but also but [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1096.8s)]
*  also for me, I think they're simply saying like it's not supposed [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1102.3s)]
*  to happen to us you peasants you can each other all day. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1106.0s)]
*  We won't do a goddamn thing about it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1108.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1110.8s)]
*  Now I'm not going to shun the Democrats too much because [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1111.3999999999999s)]
*  like this is one issue where they are on the correct side [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1113.3s)]
*  like objectively, you know, they are objectively on the right [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1116.8s)]
*  side on this issue. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1120.6s)]
*  It's like Republicans, especially that are so completely on [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1121.5s)]
*  the wrong side of this issue that it's just like like it's [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1126.9s)]
*  one of those culture war issues where like the Democrats have [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1130.6000000000001s)]
*  firmly held their ground on on their position and their commitment. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1133.8000000000002s)]
*  But you know start pointing to others that may be involved [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1142.8000000000002s)]
*  again, the Secret Service local law enforcement and the FBI [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1146.3000000000002s)]
*  who will now be taking over the lead role in the investigation [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1151.0s)]
*  of you again another attempted potentially of the former [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1155.1s)]
*  president. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1159.3s)]
*  What are all of those entities doing? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1160.9s)]
*  What is their role and responsibility again, if you think [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1162.9s)]
*  about you know, what the reporting has been to date. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1166.4s)]
*  We also understand that Secret Service agent returned fire [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1169.3s)]
*  they'll in potentially pursued the suspect again. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1174.0s)]
*  Now we have another complexity which is an agent involved [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1179.5s)]
*  shooting. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1182.9s)]
*  That's another investigation by the local prosecutors in the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1183.5s)]
*  US Attorney's Office that will also open up. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1187.0s)]
*  So again very complicated landscape not too different than [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1189.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, the the early hours around the Trump should drop [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1193.4s)]
*  out for his own safety. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1199.2s)]

*  You had snipers with tripods. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1530.6s)]
*  They knew the direction where where this had been fired and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1532.8s)]
*  they had eyes on the location where this had been fired. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1536.5s)]
*  And long story short, they were eight. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1540.8s)]
*  I have I have confirmed with both the president and with [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1544.8999999999999s)]
*  Mr. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1547.8s)]

*  drone video coverage. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1555.5s)]
*  They were able to identify the end of one individual involved [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1557.6s)]
*  in this shooting getting into a car after dropping the AK-47 [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1561.6s)]
*  and my understanding according to both of them is that that [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1567.3s)]
*  car has been identified and I believe it's been surrounded [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1571.5s)]
*  whether or not that that person has been apprehended or not. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1575.5s)]

*  This happened in a matter of seconds a little more color a [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1579.6s)]
*  little bit more details on this is that when they got on top [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1582.5s)]
*  of the president immediately what is called a fast cart that [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1586.7s)]
*  I believe has steel reinforcement and and and protection [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1590.6s)]
*  was able to whisk the president away and then the Secret Service [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1596.0s)]
*  immediately sprung into action. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1600.3999999999999s)]
*  They pounced on him. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1602.5s)]
*  But where was Laura Loomer? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1604.3s)]
*  This is what happens when you when you push aside the throat [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1606.1s)]
*  goat. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1610.5s)]
*  Okay, they had eyes on where the shooting had occurred. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1611.2s)]
*  I saw the New York Post report that these were two people [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1614.6s)]
*  shooting at each other outside the course. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1617.6s)]
*  I do know and they did confirm that the war outside of the [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1619.8s)]
*  course, but certainly seemingly within range of the former [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1623.2s)]
*  president. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1626.5s)]

*  They don't know that part. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1630.4s)]
*  I only know the part of what they experienced while they [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1631.7s)]
*  were playing golf at Trump International in West Palm. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1634.3s)]

*  that they had found first of all what happened with the [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1666.3s)]

*  that their drone footage was able to give them enough [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1672.6999999999998s)]
*  surveillance to identify the the exact car. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1675.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to lie low-key this chatter that I kind of [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1681.3s)]
*  originally said had like a unique take, but I don't know [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1685.8s)]
*  if I fully agree with I kind of I kind of with the vision [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1688.8999999999999s)]
*  chatter. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1693.1999999999998s)]
*  So that's the lot P originally was the one who suggested [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1694.1999999999998s)]
*  that most of the mass shootings like school shootings [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1698.8999999999999s)]
*  overwhelmingly have a overwhelmingly occur at public [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1703.1999999999998s)]
*  schools, right? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1706.1999999999998s)]
*  And he was like if they were happening at the same frequency [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1707.8s)]
*  in private schools, like I think rich people have a very [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1710.3s)]
*  different attitude about mass shootings in general and [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1713.2s)]
*  school shootings in general and I at the time I was like, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1715.7s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1718.7s)]
*  I feel like school shootings are like pretty commonplace, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1719.6s)]
*  but this does democratize the the likelihood of a shooting [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1722.3s)]
*  happening to people in positions of power. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1726.3999999999999s)]
*  So like, you know, they do they do change their attitude [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  pretty quickly like pretty interestingly. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1732.7s)]
*  I'm telling you if there were not private schools for rich [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1735.3s)]
*  folks to send their kids to and they had to share a school [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1737.3s)]
*  with the rest of us will be banned. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1739.4s)]
*  Like I see what you're I see where you're going with this [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1741.0s)]
*  because like Trump released a statement. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1743.7s)]

*  Dude, you have to did you get in the head like is there [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1772.4s)]
*  a bullet lodged in the back of your dome that you arrived [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1776.5s)]
*  at this conclusion? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1779.4s)]
*  Please chatter Jesus Christ. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1780.6000000000001s)]
*  One thing I do know is that copycats exist right like once [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1782.7s)]
*  there was one guy that did it other people will try to do [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1787.0s)]
*  it as well in order to either make a name for themselves [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1790.4s)]
*  Whatever if they find this to be like a mechanism where [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1794.1s)]
*  they can get like fame instead of going to schools or malls [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1799.2s)]
*  or whatever they might like actually start opening fire [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1803.6s)]
*  on Donald Trump over and over again at which case we might [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1806.5s)]
*  actually get some control which is crazy, you know, I guess [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1809.9s)]
*  that's the silver lining of the situation overall. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1813.6s)]
*  Megaphone X stop that the individual involved in the shooting [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1816.7s)]
*  Got into and further detail that they gave me was that that [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1821.1s)]
*  they were updated and told that confirmed by CNN the shooter [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1826.1s)]
*  didn't actually shoot. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1830.4s)]
*  Evan press said on CNN's live coverage. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1832.2s)]
*  The reason why they were fired was from the secret service [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1833.9s)]
*  side is they believe this person was poised to fire perhaps [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1836.5s)]
*  in direction of the former president. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1839.1s)]
*  They were trying to prevent this from happening. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1840.6s)]
*  They also ironically missed because the shooter was I [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1842.5s)]
*  believe arrested. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1846.3s)]
*  So either they like yeah, they didn't even they didn't even [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1847.8s)]
*  hurt him. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1852.3s)]
*  So like as it stands for those of you who are just tuning [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1853.2s)]

*  Okay, Donald Trump apparently like this morning as soon as [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1891.5s)]
*  I went live. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1895.1999999999998s)]

*  Okay, we didn't know what the details were but details are [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1911.1999999999998s)]

*  The man was pointing the rival the golf course where the [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1931.6s)]
*  former president was located at the time in the US Secret [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1933.5s)]

*  I believe they found him with drone footage or something. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1951.0s)]
*  They were like scouring the area with drones. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1952.9s)]
*  So the only that were fired in Trump's vicinity were actually [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=1955.1000000000001s)]

*  so it is my understanding from listening to the investigators. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2348.4s)]
*  There was a very serious incident down there and then [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2351.9s)]
*  there I'm sure they'll do some of these here in the near [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2355.4s)]
*  future. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2358.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2358.7s)]
*  We had heard about a separate accident that occurred some [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2359.2s)]
*  point on Highway during this incident. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2362.0s)]
*  Was there another accident involving pedestrians or not [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2365.2s)]
*  pedestrians but civilians? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2367.6s)]
*  Yeah, there was a serious accident just South of where [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2368.7s)]
*  the we had to stop all traffic. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2372.1s)]
*  We had a clear that vehicle using our bomb disposed bomb [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2374.1s)]
*  detection dog. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2377.6s)]
*  We actually asked the state and the county sheriff's office [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2378.7999999999997s)]
*  that came down here for Highway Patrol under the direction [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2381.0s)]
*  of Governor DeSantis moved in took over traffic. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2384.7999999999997s)]
*  But unfortunately before we could get everything stabilized [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2388.5s)]
*  there was a very serious action and they're working at now. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2391.3999999999996s)]
*  Do you know the condition of those people involved? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2394.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't I'm sorry. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2396.2999999999997s)]
*  We had also heard from a couple of bystanders that they saw [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2397.6s)]
*  woman and a child whisked away by deputy. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2400.8s)]
*  No, no, we wish nobody away. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2405.0s)]
*  There was a lone driver in the vehicle that driver is now [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2407.5s)]
*  in custody in the hands of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2411.7000000000003s)]
*  What was his demeanor sheriff when you approached the car? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2414.6s)]
*  The suspects demeanor I would describe as having a relatively [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2417.3s)]
*  calm flat a fact was not displaying a lot of emotion. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2420.6s)]
*  Never asked what what is this about? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2424.5s)]
*  Obviously law enforcement with long rifle blue lights lock [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2426.4s)]
*  on never questioned it. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2430.0s)]
*  What's he are at the time or he or she? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2432.4s)]
*  Okay, here's not all I have a hot take. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2434.6s)]
*  I have a hot take. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2437.3s)]
*  Here's it. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2438.4s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2438.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2439.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean this audio is so bad. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2440.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2442.5s)]
*  I'm going to pause it a little bit is like hard to listen to [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2443.4s)]
*  because Republicans in the eyes of like the broader electorate [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2446.4s)]
*  in the eyes of the American public kind of own political [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2451.7000000000003s)]
*  and so much that when this keeps happening to them, there [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2455.5s)]
*  is not a lot of sympathy. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2459.6s)]
*  Okay, there's not a lot of sympathy from a lot of people [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2461.2s)]
*  especially because the counter to it is like, oh you keep [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2464.7s)]
*  doing political sentiments like so most people just go [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2468.1s)]
*  what do you mean? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2471.8s)]
*  Okay, thoughts and prayers shut up, right? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2472.2s)]
*  And I think I think that like this is almost akin like it [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2474.4s)]
*  almost brings a brings attention to the problem in the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2481.1s)]
*  country automatically. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2485.0s)]
*  It's like Trump getting COVID in the midst of the election [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2487.4s)]
*  like when the election is dead close. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2491.1s)]
*  It's like coming up in November and he gets COVID and it's [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2494.2999999999997s)]
*  like a reminder to everyone that like they kind of did that, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2497.4s)]
*  you know, and now he has it and it's like another reminder [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2502.2s)]
*  that like this is an ongoing issue. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2505.6s)]
*  It would basically be like if a undocumented migrant like [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2507.5s)]
*  tried to attack Kamala Harris or something not to say that [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2512.3s)]
*  like these are similar systemic problems because there is [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2516.0s)]
*  no there is no like systemic migrant crime occurring but [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2519.8s)]
*  like in the way that Americans analyze the situation in the [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2525.8s)]
*  way that Americans analyze the situation. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2529.6s)]
*  They literally would like they they without thinking too [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2531.3s)]
*  deeply into it would most likely look at it and be like, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2535.4s)]
*  well, you deserve it. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2538.4s)]
*  You did this right? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2539.2000000000003s)]
*  So it's kind of like that for the Republicans getting, you [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2540.2000000000003s)]
*  know, getting that like this or having like an attempt. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2545.4s)]
*  I don't think I think that that's the reason why Americans [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2549.4s)]
*  don't have like a lot of sympathy because it's such a constant [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2552.2000000000003s)]
*  thing to such a constant thing that is occurring in everyday [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2555.2000000000003s)]
*  Americans lives that like we have become desensitized and [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2559.7000000000003s)]
*  it is like kind of a thing that Republicans own, you know, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2564.1s)]
*  so for that reason, it's just like whenever they try to [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2567.9s)]
*  develop a narrative around like Trump getting that or Trump [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2571.1s)]
*  having like an attempt like both both politically sentiment [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2574.1s)]
*  and also just like in general are two things that like I [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2578.2s)]
*  think most Americans intrinsically understand as the [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2582.9s)]
*  as the is the problem that the Republican Party is caused [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2588.9s)]
*  so they can't really message their way out of it, you know, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2592.6000000000004s)]
*  like it doesn't really matter and that that vehicle that [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2595.6000000000004s)]
*  you saw that is apparently related to this is now in the [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2598.6000000000004s)]
*  hands of the FBI. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2602.1000000000004s)]
*  He says that they will help with transporting it for the FBI [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2603.9s)]
*  back to Palm Beach County. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2607.3s)]
*  It's unclear obviously what else is going to happen, but he [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2608.7000000000003s)]
*  did say a male driver is in the custody and in the hands of [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2611.9s)]
*  the FBI at this time Wolf. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2616.8s)]
*  So that's an incredibly notable confirmation there from the [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2618.5s)]
*  sheriff about where they are in this investigation. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2621.7s)]
*  Obviously, there's still a lot of questions about, you know, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2624.8999999999996s)]
*  the license plate on that car. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2627.3999999999996s)]
*  Who was that car registered to? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2628.8999999999996s)]
*  What are the details of that and also where it was in relation [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2630.2999999999997s)]
*  to the golf course when you look at this and where Trump was [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2634.6s)]
*  I will say Wolf the golf course is obviously an incredibly [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2638.2999999999997s)]
*  difficult area for the Secret Service to be able to secure [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2641.0s)]
*  it is what it's an open area. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2644.7999999999997s)]
*  It's shrouded with trees. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2646.3999999999996s)]
*  It's not often easy to get a glimpse of Donald Trump. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2647.7s)]
*  He's on that golf course. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2650.6s)]
*  He can't golf anymore. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2651.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2652.8s)]
*  Does that mean Donald Trump can't golf anymore because he's [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2653.4s)]
*  oh he might actually drop out bro. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2656.1s)]
*  I'm not even joking. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2658.3s)]
*  He might literally drop out because of this like if he can't [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2659.6s)]
*  golf no more safely. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2662.9s)]
*  He's dropping he's dropping out that would piss him off so [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2664.4s)]
*  much that would ruin his life. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2667.5s)]
*  There of what exactly they do know about what happened here. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2668.5s)]
*  You can see Wolf that the area is closed off in that area. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2672.0s)]
*  He was telling people not to get on I-95 as we're waiting [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2675.3s)]
*  to get a more fulsome update. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2678.6s)]
*  Hopefully Wolf from officials. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2680.0s)]
*  Yeah, we expect that briefing and you can see live pictures [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2682.1s)]
*  coming in right now to come from the Secret Service the FBI [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2684.4s)]
*  and local law enforcement Jonathan Wackrow, you know a lot [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2687.5s)]
*  about the Secret Service. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2690.9s)]
*  Give us your sense. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2692.5s)]
*  How much more information do you think we will get during [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2693.6s)]
*  this upcoming briefing? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2696.1s)]
*  Well, you know, listen, I hope that we'll receive a lot more [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2697.4s)]
*  but Wolf, you know when you think about the the elements of [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2700.9s)]
*  this attack, right? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2704.2s)]
*  Unlike Butler where the shooter really was in plain sight for [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2705.3s)]
*  an awful long time the shooter in this incident in in this [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2709.3s)]
*  incident, you know had cover in concealment or at least some [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2713.5s)]
*  level of cover and concealment along that along the wood line [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2717.5s)]
*  you know in because of that, you know, you can you can really [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2722.4s)]
*  start to believe that the attacker actually had some level [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2726.4s)]
*  of a line of sight to where the former president was now were [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2729.8s)]
*  they in the actual range to launch an attack or were they [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2734.7000000000003s)]
*  discovered by some of these counter surveillance or other [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2738.5s)]
*  agents that you know, you know really constitute the enhanced [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2742.3s)]
*  security measures around the former president but the key [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2746.1s)]

*  sheriff Martin County is right north of Palm Beach right [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2942.6s)]
*  right north of West Palm Beach, which is where of course [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2946.1s)]
*  Donald Trump's course was and he was talking about where they [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2948.5s)]

*  in the custody of the FBI. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2954.1s)]
*  He was describing this person as having a calm demeanor when [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2955.7s)]
*  they apprehended him obviously still a lot of questions for [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2959.2999999999997s)]
*  this person. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2962.1s)]
*  I imagine that's what officials are doing right now wolf, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2962.7s)]
*  but that is where Martin County is. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2965.5s)]
*  It is just north of West Palm Beach. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2967.0s)]
*  If that gives us any indication of the direction this person [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2969.1s)]
*  was going in or what their intentions were there wolf. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2972.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's significant information. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2975.1s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2976.8s)]
*  Caitlin John Miller our law enforcement analyst is standing [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2977.9s)]
*  by as well. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2981.4s)]
*  He's working his sources. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2982.3s)]

*  What else are you learning John? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2984.6s)]
*  Well, as we said in the beginning of this reporting, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2985.9s)]
*  you know, this information is preliminary. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2988.0s)]
*  It was expected to shift and change what we've developed is [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2990.0s)]
*  a little bit of a richer picture law enforcement originally [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2993.7s)]
*  said were fired. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2996.9s)]
*  They believed at President Trump that Secret Service [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=2999.1s)]
*  returned fire as they're interviewing the agents involved [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3002.6s)]
*  and getting this richer picture. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3006.4s)]
*  It appears now that as President Trump was golfing at whichever [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3008.5s)]
*  holes he was golfing at the Secret Service team that was [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3013.2000000000003s)]
*  with him is advancing forward of that location so they can [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3017.7000000000003s)]
*  clear those areas and double-check them and at some point [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3022.8s)]
*  see this individual with a rifle pointing out from behind [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3026.7s)]
*  a tree line or a wooded area that they go confront this individual [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3031.7999999999997s)]
*  and that the shooter with the AK-47 or this semi-automatic [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3036.8999999999996s)]
*  rifle does not fire but is confronted by the Secret Service [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3041.5s)]
*  who fires at him. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3045.7s)]
*  He drops the weapon and flees witnesses see him get into [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3048.2s)]
*  that car and the sheriff Snyder told us and that's the Martin [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3052.3999999999996s)]
*  County Sheriff not the Palm Beach County Sheriff that be on [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3056.6s)]
*  the lookout for that vehicle went out. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3060.1s)]
*  They flooded the highway if you could go if you can still bring [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3062.0s)]
*  it up to the picture of that car stopped at that site, you know [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3066.4s)]
*  what you see there is a classic vehicle containment technique [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3071.1s)]
*  or a VCT where one car gets in front of him backs into him. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3076.4s)]
*  The other car gets behind him and the third car blocks him [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3081.6s)]
*  in and they come out with those long rifles pointed at him [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3084.7s)]
*  and start to give him commands which he complied with and of [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3089.1s)]
*  course then the search of that car the FBI will be taking [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3093.6s)]
*  over the investigation into the shooter and into this individual's [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3097.2999999999997s)]
*  background and and into what he was doing allegedly in that [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3101.8999999999996s)]
*  area with that rifle as the former president was playing [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3108.5s)]
*  golf just a short distance away and that is probably some of [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3112.0s)]
*  the details that we hope to get more on at this upcoming briefing [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3117.8s)]
*  from local and federal authorities. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3122.3s)]
*  I'm sure we'll get a lot more information and John Miller. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3125.0s)]
*  What does it say to you that they found near the scene of all [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3128.3s)]
*  of this at the at this golf course and AK 47 style rifle. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3131.1s)]
*  So that speaks to and you know, we've heard reporting the [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3136.3s)]
*  problem is when people who aren't familiar with guns eyewitnesses [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3141.0s)]
*  and others describe it, you know goes from AR 15 style to AK [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3144.7s)]
*  47 but we've been told AK 47 which is a foreign-made rifle. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3149.1s)]
*  You know, the AR 15 is the all-American gun that you know Americans [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3155.0s)]
*  knew from what our soldiers carried and you know, the last three [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3159.8s)]
*  wars the AK 47 is a Russian-made gun. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3163.2s)]
*  There are many Chinese made copies. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3167.7s)]
*  The AK 47 if it's correct makes this actually more likely that [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3170.8s)]
*  it's probably a gun tuber gun guy for the record or maybe even [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3177.2000000000003s)]
*  God forbid a leftist who's like really into guns but like if [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3182.9s)]
*  it actually is an AK 47 like think about who has AK 47's [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3188.0s)]
*  right and it's probably not an AK 47 but like who has a case [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3193.6s)]
*  in general gun enthusiasts. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3197.7s)]
*  Okay, we don't know anything yet. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3200.3999999999996s)]
*  We don't even know we don't even know if it is a dude who's [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3202.5s)]

*  no number one funniest outcome is registered former Trump [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3267.2999999999997s)]

*  mad that would probably be the funniest outcome not saying [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3292.8999999999996s)]
*  that these are what happened. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3297.2999999999997s)]

*  Okay, number two funniest situation would basically be like [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3302.7999999999997s)]
*  if it was a random Florida man who just had a gun on him. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3306.0s)]
*  And they just tried to shoot him immediately and they were [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3309.5s)]
*  like they were like oops, nevermind. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3313.0s)]
*  He wasn't even like intending to the president or anything. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3315.2999999999997s)]
*  He was just a gun guy. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3317.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay, and then obviously you go you go past that point and [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3319.6s)]
*  it becomes like not funny but actually scary in terms of [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3324.6s)]
*  societal consequence. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3327.7s)]
*  If the guy is a Democrat if the guy is a if the guy is a [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3329.3999999999996s)]
*  Democrat or if they're if they're a Swifty that would be [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3335.2s)]
*  kind of funny as well because like Swifties are so powerful [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3338.1s)]
*  especially as like a like a voting block and also in terms [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3341.4s)]
*  of like purchasing power that they won't like and many of [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3346.0s)]
*  them are white so they won't get like the same level of [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3349.2s)]
*  scrutiny. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3351.2s)]
*  But if it's like a you know Democrat or a leftist or some [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3352.2999999999997s)]
*  like that or if it's a migrant, oh my lord or a trans person, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3356.4s)]
*  you know, these are less likely outcomes statistically [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3361.7s)]
*  speaking. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3365.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay, and I do like that. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3366.0s)]
*  We have now become so genuinely unserious about this sort of [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3368.1s)]
*  that like we hurt we are just like we're doing like we're [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3374.0s)]
*  doing crazy speculations for funsies at this point because [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3378.7999999999997s)]
*  of how normalized this is at Trump immediately tried to [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3382.7s)]
*  fundraise off of this like even he's not taking it seriously. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3385.5s)]
*  Okay, even he ain't taking it seriously dog. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3388.7s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3391.7s)]
*  What about an apolitical Swiftie? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3392.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3394.0s)]
*  It is wild stuff though. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3395.8s)]
*  God damn it is crazy. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3397.5s)]
*  Let's see what the Fox News is saying though in situations [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3399.1s)]
*  like this something that is and this is a little bit of a leap [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3401.8s)]
*  about something that's politically motivated. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3404.4s)]
*  It's almost like terrorism which is motivated by an ideal [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3406.6s)]
*  right in ideology. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3410.6s)]
*  This is how the perpetrators talk to the world and so very [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3412.2s)]
*  often, you know, it's been my experience that terrorism [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3416.7s)]
*  suspects that the problem is not getting them to talk the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3419.3s)]
*  problem is getting them to shut up and to keep them on topic [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3422.2s)]
*  because you know, they tend to ramble and they're all over [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3426.1s)]
*  the place. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3428.2s)]
*  So we don't know and there are no hard and fixed rules on [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3428.7s)]
*  this kind of thing and it always depends on the person's, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3431.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, personal demeanor and where they're coming from. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3435.1s)]
*  But in a situation like this if it is in fact politically [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3438.7999999999997s)]
*  motivated. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3442.7s)]
*  Yeah, I would I would go out on a limb a little bit and say [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3443.7999999999997s)]
*  there is a chance that he'll talk and he very well may be [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3446.5s)]
*  proud of it. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3449.6s)]
*  If in fact he was motivated and we don't know this, you know, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3450.2s)]
*  it's really funny. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3453.0s)]
*  What's really crazy about it is that like the last political [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3453.8s)]
*  seemingly wasn't politically motivated like it was as close [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3456.9s)]
*  to like non-political as you can get as a registered Republican [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3461.6s)]
*  shooting at the former Republican president like the last [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3467.8s)]
*  attempt and it's kind of wild like because usually it's like [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3471.0s)]
*  the one thing because shootings happen all the time in the [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3474.8s)]
*  United States of America and in many circumstances is a guy [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3478.3s)]
*  who's like, you know, insane. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3482.1000000000004s)]
*  It's a guy who's usually insane wants to make a name for [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3484.3s)]
*  himself wants to die all the stuff, right? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3486.4s)]
*  The last political was the closest you can get to it being [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3489.7000000000003s)]
*  non-political like while still being inherently political [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3495.3s)]
*  because it was a political attempt at it, which is crazy. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3499.0s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3502.3s)]
*  I mean, I guess Ronald Reagan was similar to God history. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3503.2000000000003s)]
*  History just history is out of options, dude. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3506.6s)]
*  There is nothing new that ever happens. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3509.6s)]
*  It's always the same. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3511.6s)]
*  They just keep repeating it over and over again. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3513.2999999999997s)]
*  I swear to God earlier in the broadcast, you know, there was [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3515.7s)]
*  the one car which began to suggest maybe this was a targeted [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3518.7s)]
*  event. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3522.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, then you have to say to yourself, how did he know has [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3523.2999999999997s)]
*  this person been surveilling that golf course on Sundays regularly? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3526.1s)]
*  Has he been trailing Donald Trump as he can was that not picked [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3530.5s)]
*  up? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3534.0s)]
*  You know, you have to start to ask some of these deeper [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3534.7000000000003s)]
*  questions and I think that that will go into the investigation. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3537.1s)]
*  But one thing we should notice is that he's now been identified [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3540.9s)]
*  as and what that means now is that the FBI has the case because [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3544.4s)]
*  there is a direct statute on point that says that if you tried [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3548.1s)]
*  it a president you violate that statute and that puts the FBI [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3552.6s)]
*  in the lead. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3557.0s)]
*  Oh, thank God. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3558.2000000000003s)]
*  We do have a statement from the FBI's office, the National [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3558.8s)]
*  Press Operations unit. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3562.8s)]
*  I didn't realize there was a statute against like political [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3564.4s)]
*  as that. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3567.7999999999997s)]
*  I didn't know it was illegal. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3568.1s)]
*  Mr. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3569.2s)]

*  He an attempted a former president Trump. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3571.2s)]
*  Yeah, so that tracks, you know, once it's declared an attempt [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3574.7999999999997s)]
*  on a president or former president, the FBI has the ticket [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3577.4s)]
*  under that statute. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3580.5s)]
*  That's well established. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3581.5s)]
*  That's why even in Butler the FBI is not investigating any [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3582.9s)]
*  of the failures that might have occurred with the Secret Service [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3587.2999999999997s)]
*  which certainly looked to have broken down. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3590.4s)]
*  That's not their job. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3592.4s)]
*  They're investigating the attempted of Donald Trump. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3593.8s)]
*  They don't even have the lead on the civilian that was or the [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3596.2000000000003s)]
*  two civilians that were wounded. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3599.9s)]
*  So these things are very proscribed the right now to Bureau [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3601.6000000000004s)]
*  has the ticket and in a case like this that that's important [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3603.9s)]
*  and it's good because this person may not even be from the [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3608.4s)]
*  area. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3612.2000000000003s)]
*  There's something at this level. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3613.0s)]
*  He may have traveled and my understanding is I can say I [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3614.1000000000004s)]
*  believe he's a male usually is and there's some social media [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3617.7000000000003s)]
*  out there that he's a male. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3621.2000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, he may have traveled from outside the area, which [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3622.3s)]
*  means he would have done surveillance, etc. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3626.6000000000004s)]
*  But then you're going to need the Bureau's reach to look back [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3628.4s)]
*  and reach into where he's from and we don't know where he's [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3631.2000000000003s)]
*  from could be very far away. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3634.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, the FBI is reaching they are investigating it. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3635.6000000000004s)]
*  They're on top of it. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3639.1000000000004s)]
*  Standby for me. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3640.3s)]

*  right there and whether or not that did happen. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3667.0s)]
*  We do know that a Secret Service agent were told in [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3668.9s)]
*  advance on tuber reviewed cooks and on it was pretty funny [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3672.1s)]
*  and shows how not serious people are taking all this. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3675.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that comes from just like how normalized is [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3677.6s)]
*  in this country. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3681.7s)]
*  It's just like so commonplace. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3682.9s)]
*  The unique aspect of this is that it's happening to a person [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3685.5s)]
*  in of note like a person of notoriety in a position of power [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3689.0s)]

*  the former president follows a certain pattern of life. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3723.1s)]
*  Everyone knows he likes to play golf if this man was staking [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3725.9s)]
*  out the former president. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3729.0s)]
*  He wouldn't have to go far just four and a half miles from [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3730.1s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago to Trump International to play golf. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3733.0s)]
*  It is notable that it was the secret service that dude [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3736.3s)]
*  that's pretty funny. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3739.4s)]
*  He's not going to be able to golf anymore. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3740.8s)]
*  Like I'm not kidding you like all the trials and stuff like [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3742.7000000000003s)]
*  that sucks for him, right? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3746.0s)]
*  But that's that you can make go away with money and he's [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3748.0s)]
*  already farming his Sims to get as much money as possible to [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3751.7000000000003s)]

*  But this like if he is bro, if he cannot golf any longer [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3759.2000000000003s)]
*  because of the like the high-profile nature of this attempted [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3763.9s)]
*  that he might himself like I feel like that's the one thing [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3770.2000000000003s)]
*  he enjoys, you know in life like that's the one thing he [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3773.9s)]
*  does all the time. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3776.8s)]
*  Prior to this incident source it privately expressed concerns [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3779.2000000000003s)]
*  about Trump's safety while he's golfing his clubs are surveilled [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3781.5s)]

*  However, areas around his course including Trump International [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3786.0s)]
*  and are visible from the outside. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3789.2000000000003s)]
*  That's what I'm saying dog. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  That's got to be the saddest thing on that weapon to be able [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3792.5s)]
*  to fire around that could have effect. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3795.6s)]
*  So it obviously is a very dangerous weapon is a high-powered [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3797.8s)]
*  weapon. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3802.1s)]
*  Once we see the the weapon to see whether or not this [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3803.4s)]
*  individual had a scope. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3807.7s)]

*  of weight on the other two and there's only so much diet coke [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3829.7999999999997s)]
*  you can drink throughout the day. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3833.8999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3835.7s)]

*  supposed to be doing protecting the former president of the [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3845.2s)]
*  United States while he's simply out on a Sunday afternoon [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3848.5s)]

*  We're right outside here at Trump International Golf Course [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3875.2s)]
*  Not too far from Mar-a-Lago, but I can tell you that the [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3878.9s)]
*  law enforcement presence is certainly real here. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3882.6s)]
*  Just getting here was a challenge. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3885.4s)]
*  Just speaking to that for a moment. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3887.3s)]
*  I came from where I was about 25 minutes away and it took me [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3889.1s)]
*  quite some time to get here even just getting down Highway [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3894.0s)]
*  95, which I know the Martin. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3896.2000000000003s)]
*  They said the shooter is a 60 year old white man chap. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3897.6s)]
*  I mean don't take a sigh of relief yet, but that kind of [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3900.5s)]
*  makes cars people on bicycles pedestrians quickly. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3904.4s)]
*  Put away into this other put to the side. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3908.4s)]
*  That was when the motorcade was just about to move. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3910.8s)]
*  They were finally had finally deemed it safe to move the [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3912.8s)]
*  former president from here at Trump International. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3915.7000000000003s)]
*  So we did get some video of that of the motorcade moving [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3918.5s)]
*  but wolf this has been on lockdown. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3922.0s)]
*  As you know, the golf course went into lockdown immediately [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3924.6s)]
*  when those were fired those Secret Service firing at that [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3927.4s)]
*  at that individual who was later apprehended but I can tell [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3930.9s)]
*  you that it's still very much an active scene here. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3934.1s)]
*  There's more security outside Trump International golf course [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3936.6s)]
*  here. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3940.5s)]
*  There's a kind of eliminate certain possibilities, you know [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3940.7s)]
*  what I mean, but as you can imagine a golf course on a [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3942.9s)]
*  Sunday, it could be busy. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3945.2999999999997s)]
*  There's certainly a lot of ground to cover and when you [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3947.4s)]
*  heard John Miller talking about Secret Service fighting that [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3950.6s)]
*  individual through the trees or seeing the rifle at least [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=3952.9s)]

*  Well, then it's a something burger. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4098.9s)]
*  Okay, you know again, I'm just wondering how this changes [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4101.0s)]
*  this investigation. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4105.0s)]
*  You've got the FBI involved. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4105.8s)]
*  And this guy is now, you know considered a potential. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4107.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4112.4s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of outstanding questions that are [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4113.1s)]
*  going to be asked first and that is is this individual [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4115.8s)]
*  acting alone part of a larger group. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4119.5s)]
*  Is there a greater threat to not only the former president [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4122.4s)]
*  or those associated with him including his running mate, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4126.4s)]
*  JD Vance or to the greater public and these fall under [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4129.4s)]
*  what are known as exemptions to Miranda. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4133.9s)]
*  That is you want the questions answered and you don't care [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4136.5s)]
*  if they become admissible down the line in a court of law. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4140.599999999999s)]
*  You want to make sure that you're asking the right questions [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4143.799999999999s)]
*  to identify the threat level that the former president [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4147.0s)]
*  continues to face. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4150.599999999999s)]
*  Is this a one-of-one incident or is it a one of many for [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4152.0s)]
*  today and that's what the FBI and Secret Service need to [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4157.099999999999s)]
*  determine right away regardless of where this goes in a court [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4160.299999999999s)]
*  of law and charges against a suspect down the line. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4164.8s)]
*  You want to make sure this the public is safe and that the [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4168.1s)]
*  former president and his colleagues remain safe as far [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4171.5s)]
*  as the investigation goes. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4174.8s)]
*  This will be a whole of government approach when you're [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4176.1s)]
*  dealing with something like this. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4178.3s)]
*  There will be no limit placed on the resources to get to [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4180.3s)]
*  the bottom of this. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4184.0s)]
*  We know that we're facing challenges in the bubble. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4184.900000000001s)]
*  If he was GOP, he would have gone after Vance. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4187.6s)]
*  No, Trump has a lot of parasocial stands and parasocial [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4190.2s)]
*  stands at least in my estimation from my own personal [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4194.5s)]
*  experience and sometimes become your most rabid haters. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4198.4s)]
*  Okay, that happens more frequently than you would think. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4202.6s)]
*  But Mirandizing him is what I understand you to say is not [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4207.8s)]
*  the most imperative point at that point. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4211.7s)]
*  They want to get as much information from this guy as [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4214.2s)]
*  quickly as they need to get it and while and so therefore [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4217.3s)]
*  If this information is not admissible in court later, it [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4222.0s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4224.599999999999s)]
*  They need to know if this is a widespread spread threat or [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4225.4s)]
*  if the threat has been limited to a more narrow scope. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4228.299999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4233.5s)]
*  And that's a risk approach based on the law enforcement [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4234.0s)]
*  professionals that are going to be in the room with this [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4236.599999999999s)]
*  individual from the FBI to local law enforcement and the [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4238.7s)]
*  Secret Service and there's two ways to accomplish that either [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4242.099999999999s)]
*  you ask the questions that you want answered without providing [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4245.2s)]
*  Miranda or you get the suspect the rights and agrees to talk [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4249.400000000001s)]
*  with you in that case. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4253.7s)]
*  The latter you keep all the information that the suspect [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4255.6s)]
*  gives you and that becomes admissible in a court of law. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4259.1s)]
*  If you take the former and you start asking me urgent [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4262.400000000001s)]
*  questions that you need answered and the suspect invokes Miranda [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4265.900000000001s)]
*  you still don't care in this type of situation you want. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4270.1s)]
*  Well, I'm telling you the funniest. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4273.900000000001s)]

*  So it's unsurprising that there are people inside of that office [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4375.900000000001s)]
*  that is in downtown downtown ish West Palm Beach. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4379.3s)]
*  So probably a roughly 12-minute drive from Mar-a-Lago and that [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4382.6s)]
*  there are a number as I said a number of senior aides and [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4387.3s)]
*  advisors as well as junior staffers who have all moved down [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4391.599999999999s)]
*  to the West Palm Beach area and just a reminder that in the [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4395.0s)]
*  days after the attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, there was [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4397.8s)]
*  a memo sent out by campaign manager Susie Wiles and Chris [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4401.099999999999s)]
*  LaSavita essentially telling staffers not to go into the [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4403.9s)]
*  office not just in West Palm Beach, but around the country [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4407.099999999999s)]
*  just to keep them safe. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4410.599999999999s)]
*  There was a heightened amount of insecurity and anxiety among [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4413.0s)]
*  people who are close to former president Donald Trump while [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4417.1s)]
*  they did not believe that any of these offices were intended [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4419.3s)]
*  targets. Law enforcement did secure all of these offices [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4422.6s)]
*  around the country particularly one outside of Washington DC [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4426.3s)]
*  and in West Palm Beach, Florida to make sure that those [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4429.700000000001s)]
*  staffers were safe. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4433.400000000001s)]
*  They were told to work from home at that time. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4434.3s)]
*  I will tell you that there's been a lot of sheriff said the [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4437.200000000001s)]
*  guy was compliant though funny as it would as it would be [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4439.700000000001s)]
*  this won't be an auditor type. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4443.6s)]
*  Yeah, if he's compliant, then he's probably not a Second [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4444.8s)]
*  Amendment auditor because a Second Amendment auditor ain't [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4447.8s)]
*  being compliant when being arrested. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4450.5s)]
*  Okay, they probably would have domed him though the honestly [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4452.1s)]
*  that'd be the sickest Second Amendment audit dude. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4455.1s)]
*  That'd be the coolest Second Amendment audit because like [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4457.2s)]
*  technically it's not illegal. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4460.2s)]
*  It's one of those situations where it's like, yeah, you're [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4462.1s)]
*  just mad because you don't like the law rules of the road [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4464.1s)]

*  So when we get done think about your questions because we're [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4479.5s)]
*  not going to take a lot and keep them to the information that [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4482.2s)]

*  not going to go there. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4488.7s)]
*  All right, so keep that in mind and we'll be good. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4489.599999999999s)]
*  So here we go. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4494.0s)]
*  All right 1 30 this afternoon call came out fire that was [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4494.8s)]
*  called in by the Secret Service because we're in constant [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4498.4s)]
*  contact with them all the time. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4501.5s)]
*  We were notified of that and we had you this here that [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4504.4s)]
*  immediately sealed off the area. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4508.099999999999s)]
*  Fortunately, we were able to locate a witness that came to [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4510.8s)]
*  us and said, hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4514.099999999999s)]
*  He jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4518.2s)]
*  vehicle and the tag which was great. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4522.099999999999s)]
*  So we had that information our real-time Center put it out to [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4525.4s)]
*  the license plate readers and we were able to get a hit on [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4531.5s)]
*  that vehicle on I-95 as it was headed into Martin County. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4535.5s)]
*  We got a hold of Martin County Sheriff's Office alerted them [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4540.4s)]
*  and they spotted the vehicle and pulled it over and detained [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4544.0s)]
*  the guy after that we took the victim. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4547.3s)]
*  I'm sorry the witness that witnessed the incident took [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4550.6s)]
*  through him up there and he identified as the person that [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4554.3s)]
*  he saw running out of the bushes and jumped into the car. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4557.7s)]
*  Now in the bushes where this guy was is a 8k 47 style rifle [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4560.8s)]
*  with a scope two backpacks which were hung on the fence that [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4566.099999999999s)]

*  take pictures of so those are being processed right now. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4573.4s)]
*  The Secret Service agent that was on the course did a [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4577.3s)]
*  fantastic job. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4580.599999999999s)]
*  What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4582.2s)]
*  of time to where the president was at. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4586.3s)]
*  Why are you explaining how they do this? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4588.400000000001s)]

*  prepared dog at which time the individual took off. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4594.1s)]

*  We have somebody in custody right now. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4600.1s)]

*  but as we usually do as soon as we decide that we're going [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4606.2s)]
*  to book him into the County Jail and the charges that he's [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4609.400000000001s)]

*  It's going to take a little bit of training and practice to [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4799.200000000001s)]
*  get somebody to deliver around like that accurately at that [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4801.5s)]
*  distance, but certainly within the realm of possibility. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4804.6s)]
*  We don't know if this individual had any law enforcement [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4807.700000000001s)]
*  or military background or if he's got any shooting or marksmanship [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4810.3s)]
*  in his background, but those are all things that the that the [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4813.400000000001s)]
*  FBI will be looking into because we have a live shooter [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4816.8s)]
*  unlike Butler. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4821.0s)]
*  This is a case that's going to be an investigation that's [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4822.3s)]
*  going to be driving towards prosecuting this individual [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4825.2s)]
*  successfully and putting him to jail for a long time. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4828.2s)]
*  So you can bet that search will see search warrants executed [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4830.9s)]
*  later on this evening. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4834.0s)]
*  We'll see a lot of FBI folks at his residence maybe at his [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4835.3s)]
*  work. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4838.7s)]
*  You'll see that vehicle impounded and searched and they [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4839.3s)]
*  are going to be looking for all of the pieces of evidence that [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4842.099999999999s)]
*  might indicate planning motive and whether or not any other [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4844.7s)]
*  individuals knew about what he was doing and may have helped [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4849.5s)]
*  him or helped him plan or anything like that. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4852.599999999999s)]
*  In addition to the scope on that AK-47 rifle, which was intended [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4855.3s)]
*  according to the FBI for of the former president the fact that [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4860.2s)]
*  they found this GoPro equipment in one of the backpacks as [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4863.099999999999s)]
*  well suggests to me and I wonder Andrew if it suggests to you [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4867.099999999999s)]
*  that this suspect had some political motive wanted publicity [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4870.599999999999s)]
*  wanted to get a lot of exposure for what was going on. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4874.8s)]
*  It certainly indicates to me that he was looking for that's [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4877.8s)]
*  not a why are they saying that's a AK-47? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4881.0s)]
*  I don't think that's a AK-47 dog and episodes of political [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4884.2s)]
*  sometimes it can be very hard to identify a specific political [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4889.2s)]
*  motive for this case in point is the butler shooter at this [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4893.7s)]
*  point. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4897.0s)]
*  We still have not unearthed a very clear. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4897.3s)]
*  What do you want clearly? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4900.2s)]
*  He was trying to Donald Trump but a strong ideological reason [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4901.3s)]
*  like a SKS. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4906.0s)]
*  I haven't been able to identify that yet. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4906.7s)]
*  So we'll see if we find out here but no question. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4908.3s)]
*  Well, if you're absolutely right the presence of the GoPro is [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4911.1s)]
*  an effort to preserve the images of this attack so that the [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4913.900000000001s)]
*  shooter could use that for some purpose in the future either [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4918.1s)]
*  to pump up his own image and and glorification online things [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4922.2s)]
*  of that nature. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4927.400000000001s)]
*  We know that mass shooters do that a lot. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4927.900000000001s)]
*  It's very important to them to communicate their their success [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4930.3s)]
*  there their attack online may have just been that or it may [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4935.0s)]
*  have been some ideologically motivated politically motivated [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4939.8s)]
*  act right now. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4944.5s)]
*  It's super early in the investigation, but those are definitely [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4945.5s)]
*  the things we're going to be looking to hear from the FBI [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4948.6s)]
*  as they learn more and is the FBI Andrew and your former [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4951.5s)]
*  Deputy Director of the FBI is the FBI now in charge of this [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4954.3s)]
*  investigation not the Secret Service not Palm Beach County [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4958.1s)]
*  Sheriff's Office. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4961.5s)]
*  It's the FBI which is in charge. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4962.3s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4964.3s)]
*  They absolutely are Wolf as as you know under presidential [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4965.1s)]
*  directive 12 Triple 3 the FBI has primary responsibility for [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4969.2s)]
*  investigating any acts of terrorism here in the United [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4973.0s)]
*  States. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4975.8s)]
*  This would certainly be considered an act of terrorism possibly [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4976.2s)]
*  domestic terrorism. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4979.6s)]
*  Although again, wait and see was we get more details about [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4980.6s)]
*  this shooter but absolutely that the FBI would be the late lead [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4983.3s)]
*  agency. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4986.9s)]
*  Now it doesn't mean they'll do it by themselves. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4987.4s)]
*  They clearly will work very closely with the Secret Service [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4989.599999999999s)]
*  and also with the Palm Beach County and Martin County [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4992.799999999999s)]
*  Sheriff's Offices, but you will see the Bureau kind of taking [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4995.4s)]
*  the kind of the lead role on the execution of search warrants [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=4999.0s)]
*  the collection of evidence preservation of evidence and [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5002.7s)]
*  then I would would expect pretty soon. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5005.9s)]
*  You're going to hear about Southern District of Florida [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5008.0s)]
*  prosecutors weighing in as to whether or not this person will [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5010.5s)]
*  also be charged at the federal level. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5014.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I suspect that will happen and we did hear Dave [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5017.2s)]
*  Ehrenberg the Palm Beach County attorney suggesting that there [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5019.7s)]
*  would be probably state charges local charges as well as [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5023.2s)]
*  eventually federal charges as well as suspect. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5026.5s)]
*  That's what's going on right now are Andrew McCabe everyone [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5029.5s)]
*  else stand by Caitlin. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5032.5s)]
*  We're getting a lot of information right now to digest [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5034.1s)]
*  and I presumably believe in the next few minutes and hours. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5037.0s)]
*  We're going to get a whole lot more. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5040.5s)]
*  Yeah, well that was a remarkable update that we got from [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5041.8s)]
*  officials and the that detail that a Secret Service agent [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5044.4s)]

*  it auto clocks out every single person. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5067.7s)]

*  We went from 40,000 to 7,000 active viewers. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5073.0s)]

*  I am truly shocked and so appreciative of the agent that [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5192.2s)]
*  spotted that rifle because if you look at it, it is very [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5197.0s)]
*  difficult. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5199.6s)]
*  There's leaves. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5199.9s)]
*  There's a fence. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5200.7s)]
*  There's shrubs. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5201.7s)]
*  There's all kinds of different things. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5202.6s)]
*  The fact that they spotted that and then acted without hesitation [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5203.8s)]
*  to me is amazing. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5207.3s)]
*  And so, you know, like you said though, but why why does it [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5209.9s)]
*  have to get to there and that's a question. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5212.3s)]
*  I think that they have to answer. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5213.9s)]
*  No Ron Roe being the US director US Secret Service director. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5215.0s)]
*  I was going to have to answer that like what happened and why [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5218.1s)]
*  and I'm sure he will there may be more circumstances were [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5220.3s)]
*  unaware of but the fact that they did spot that and a very [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5222.900000000001s)]
*  very difficult surroundings we go through train with these me [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5226.0s)]
*  as a with the counter-assault team with your trains like this [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5229.200000000001s)]
*  on a daily routine, but have it real life not not be panicked [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5231.900000000001s)]
*  and make an engagement like that is amazing. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5236.700000000001s)]
*  So I don't know what the answer is to that. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5239.8s)]
*  I think we're going to find out here for sure. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5241.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if he if he was the sitting president that street [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5243.3s)]
*  would have been closed if he was the sitting president they [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5246.5s)]
*  would have had a covers in areas like what type of precaution [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5249.7s)]
*  did you take when former President Obama was on the golf [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5252.7s)]
*  course talking about to make what are you talking about is [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5256.6s)]
*  the same level of precautions and security levels were enacted [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5259.7s)]
*  especially the golf course. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5265.7s)]
*  You're you're a moving perimeter just like a motorcade. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5266.6s)]
*  You know, you can only control what you control within your [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5269.5s)]
*  environment can't and I don't know the mapping. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5271.7s)]
*  I'm not sure of the street that they went on but you know, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5274.1s)]
*  are there different surveillance units of course there are but [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5276.8s)]
*  you're talking a large large area should this have happened [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5279.900000000001s)]
*  63 days after a prior attempt. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5283.0s)]
*  Absolutely not right. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5285.200000000001s)]
*  I think there there is something that needs to be looked at. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5286.3s)]
*  Okay, where did where was the gap again and I hate to even [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5288.400000000001s)]
*  say that again, but I believe the secret service will investigate [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5291.200000000001s)]
*  this and as prior guests had said, you know address it and [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5294.6s)]
*  probably closed down the streets now, but again, how are those [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5297.700000000001s)]
*  are you able to close down the streets? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5301.6s)]
*  How much is that impeding other things because you have to [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5303.1s)]
*  think of other things to right routing traffic infrastructure. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5305.5s)]
*  There's more than just an unfortunate. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5308.900000000001s)]
*  There's more than that's from Piers Morgan. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5310.700000000001s)]
*  I don't know how valid this is, but he does kind of look like [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5312.6s)]
*  a lip-tart a little bit from the vibes alone, but it's Piers [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5315.1s)]
*  Morgan. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5318.6s)]
*  So who knows now thankfully a witness saw the car at the [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5318.900000000001s)]
*  vehicle the black Nissan SUV and the license plate. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5324.700000000001s)]
*  So they able to pull him over and get him. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5327.8s)]
*  What does it tell you when he is able to secrete himself inside [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5329.8s)]
*  bushes hang those knapsacks on a fence and have a GoPro which [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5333.0s)]
*  you potentially could put on social media to record what he [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5337.7s)]
*  perhaps allegedly thought was the of a former president. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5343.0s)]
*  I'll tell you first of all, you said the best thing ever had [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5346.3s)]
*  golfing at Andrews. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5348.6s)]
*  It was always it was always a great thing not that security [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5349.6s)]
*  lacks, but you also have the US military there which made [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5351.7s)]
*  things a lot less stress-free but there's still stress transferring [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5354.3s)]
*  that to open golf course of public public private in an open [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5358.1s)]
*  military establishment is difficult right what I'd like to [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5361.5s)]
*  see come out of this is what's on that growth go-kokes. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5364.8s)]
*  I believe what you had said earlier is right that social [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5367.7s)]
*  media may be a play in this and maybe very big are they going [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5370.3s)]
*  to display it how was this terrorist terrorist related was [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5373.2s)]
*  this just a soul in the soul incident. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5376.1s)]
*  This is Jack. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5378.3s)]
*  He's a white dude. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5379.3s)]
*  Of course, he's trans like immediately if it's a white man [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5380.2s)]
*  just like every other white man that has done a shooting every [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5385.8s)]
*  single day for like the last 10 years, they will immediately [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5389.5s)]
*  say, oh, it's a white man. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5393.4s)]
*  So it's got to be a trans trans person. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5394.4s)]
*  Okay, if it's a siset white man, they hit the trans line every [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5397.1s)]
*  time it don't matter. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5401.6s)]
*  It don't matter immediately. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5404.1s)]
*  They're like, oh, that's a trans woman actually. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5405.4s)]
*  Okay, that's just literally the only method they have at this [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5408.0s)]
*  point. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5412.2s)]
*  Okay, and it's not like it doesn't matter. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5412.7s)]
*  It's not correct, but they just say it anyway, and that's [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5414.8s)]
*  probably what will happen. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5417.1s)]
*  I'm not of the know of the sweep itself when it comes to [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5418.2s)]
*  that they've changed our policies, but I'll tell you they [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5421.099999999999s)]
*  do sweeps. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5424.2s)]
*  They do understand the circumstances now again, 63 days [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5424.8s)]
*  apart that this needs to be active. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5427.8s)]
*  This is be quickly this is be identified quickly adapted [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5429.4s)]
*  quickly and mitigated quickly to make sure that this does not [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5431.8s)]
*  happen again. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5434.9s)]
*  Here's the we all know that you have any that drug. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5435.9s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5438.599999999999s)]
*  Here's the Pombi chair for a few moments ago at the news conference. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5439.4s)]
*  Let's listen if the golf course is surrounded by shrubbery. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5442.2s)]
*  So some when somebody gets into the shrubbery, they're pretty [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5444.7s)]
*  much out of sight. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5447.3s)]
*  All right, and at this level that he is at right now, he's [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5448.9s)]
*  not the sitting president. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5452.5s)]
*  If he was we would have had this higher golf course around [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5454.0s)]
*  it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5456.5s)]
*  Well, because he's not the security is limited to the areas [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5457.4s)]
*  that the Secret Service Deems possible. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5460.4s)]
*  So I would imagine that the next time he comes at a golf [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5464.0s)]
*  course, there'll probably be a little more people around the [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5467.099999999999s)]
*  perimeter. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5470.0s)]
*  What strikes me about that comment is he's not the sitting [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5470.7s)]
*  president and he's not former presidents do not receive of [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5473.3s)]
*  course, the same level of security as sitting presidents [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5477.6s)]
*  do but I'm going to end with the way I began this interview. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5480.8s)]
*  Don't you think it's time that he get near the level perhaps [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5485.0s)]
*  of a sitting president? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5489.200000000001s)]
*  It does take more risk. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5491.0s)]
*  No too many too many drain on our resources. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5491.900000000001s)]
*  No, they should not do that with local law enforcement. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5494.200000000001s)]
*  No, at least close the streets for God's sake. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5496.900000000001s)]
*  No, no, I don't think so. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5499.900000000001s)]
*  Can hide in some bushes and by the stroke and luck of God, a [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5502.900000000001s)]
*  Secret Service agent saw muzzle in bushes and was able to [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5507.0s)]
*  prevent a tragedy. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5511.1s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5512.9s)]
*  And it may have been an act of God. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5513.8s)]
*  Like you said in the like I said that the accolades to the [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5516.4s)]
*  Secret Service agent, which I'm assuming probably come a [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5519.2s)]
*  counter assault team guy up ahead of the time was trained [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5522.7s)]
*  very well to do that. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5525.4s)]
*  But I think you're right. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5526.3s)]
*  I think that they need to do an assessment of all, you know, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5527.5s)]
*  current or incumbent presidents of nominees. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5530.3s)]
*  How will you pay for it? [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5532.8s)]
*  How will you pay for it? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5533.7s)]
*  How will you pay for it? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5534.7s)]
*  We have to shut down the entire country every time Trump [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5535.700000000001s)]

*  We have very little information about this person. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5729.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's correct. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5733.3s)]
*  I mean in cases where there may be an immediate threat to the [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5734.3s)]
*  public or other individuals, is that exception can be made [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5737.4s)]
*  and as it would for instance, the terrorist instance to see [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5743.5s)]
*  whether or not there are other compatriots out there, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5747.0s)]
*  whether there's other plans and be able to kind of what those [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5750.0s)]
*  plans and make sure that other people are safe. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5752.599999999999s)]
*  So it's very possible that they decide to take that approach [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5754.9s)]
*  on it. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5758.9s)]
*  I think this whole issue of going to digital footprint, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5760.0s)]
*  we need to also kind of look and say, you know, my view when [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5763.7s)]
*  I'm hearing this, I'm hearing... [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5766.3s)]
*  I think the funniest problem here is that like because of the [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5767.7s)]
*  likelihood of repeat customers because of the way that like [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5770.7s)]
*  these sorts of attacks work, Trump is looking real school-like [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5773.7s)]
*  right now, if you know what I'm saying. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5776.3s)]
*  Like that is unironically the funniest outcome of all of this [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5777.8s)]
*  is that like people who want to like make a name for themselves [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5780.8s)]
*  are probably going to try and do this again now, which is [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5784.5s)]
*  you're saying brah-la-mow, but like this is the only way to [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5787.900000000001s)]

*  do this over and over again. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5796.799999999999s)]
*  They're most likely going to get like in the attempts, but [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5798.299999999999s)]
*  like because it's becoming like an actual problem, a problem [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5801.9s)]
*  that you, if you're an average American, if you go to public [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5805.299999999999s)]

*  they've blocked him in on three sides. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5880.400000000001s)]
*  So he can be nothing but calm and he was compliant with [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5883.1s)]
*  the commands they gave him and then he was taken into [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5887.7s)]
*  custody. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5890.900000000001s)]

*  Well, and Andrew McKay, when you when you look at this [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5896.400000000001s)]
*  and Wolf, I was just thinking about this when you look [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5899.7s)]
*  at what we're hearing from officials and you see those [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5901.5s)]
*  two pictures there of the backpacks that were that were [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5903.2s)]
*  left at the scene that they found inside these bushes [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5906.8s)]
*  to the on the right side of this of your screen and the [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5910.8s)]
*  left. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5913.7s)]
*  That's a that's a GoPro camera official said that was [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5914.1s)]
*  mounted on the fence and then two bags as well. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5917.3s)]
*  Andrew McKay when you're an investigator and you're [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5921.2s)]
*  looking into that. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5923.0s)]
*  I mean it clearly speaks to some kind of pre of what [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5923.8s)]
*  they're looking into when they're talking to this [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5927.3s)]
*  suspect who was who was in the book. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5929.0s)]
*  Dude, I'm telling you tuber is so funny like like this [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5931.1s)]
*  being potentially a tuber makes this peak that is done [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5935.0s)]
*  because this person whoever he is here clearly had the [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5939.9s)]
*  capacity to engage in that sort of structured and organized [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5943.7s)]
*  thought which is which is a big piece of this because that [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5948.6s)]
*  will undermine and that can undermine a lot of different [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5951.7s)]
*  defenses at trial. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5955.0s)]
*  So you have someone who had the wherewithal the financial [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5956.8s)]
*  oh my God. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5961.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5962.1s)]
*  Someone of the chest has something brilliant and really [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5962.8s)]
*  funny. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5965.099999999999s)]
*  Do you think these are time travelers that are trying to [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5966.2s)]
*  stop him from becoming president? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5968.8s)]
*  I do now. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5971.5s)]
*  I didn't before I do now. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5973.2s)]
*  Oh my God bullet. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5975.4s)]
*  So this is someone who went through a lot of effort to [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5976.9s)]
*  really plan this out. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5980.599999999999s)]
*  I think we also have to remember that they somehow knew [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5981.8s)]
*  where to go. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5985.8s)]
*  They had some indication maybe that Trump was playing [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5987.2s)]
*  golf on this day. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5991.099999999999s)]
*  We don't know that for a fact yet, but that's something [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5991.9s)]
*  that investigators going to be looking for obviously pick [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5994.5s)]
*  this location as one of tactical advantage likely because [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=5997.799999999999s)]
*  of the cover provided by the by the foliage and the bushes [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6001.5s)]
*  that he was hiding himself with probably had some advanced [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6005.4s)]
*  knowledge of how the golf course is laid out and where [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6009.5s)]
*  the former president would be proceeding from one hole to [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6012.4s)]
*  another. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6015.299999999999s)]
*  So this is all a very high degree of planning which is [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6015.599999999999s)]
*  great evidence for the prosecution and finally just [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6018.7s)]
*  recovering these backpacks with the stuff in them and the [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6021.7s)]
*  vehicle that he was driving in when he was arrested you [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6025.1s)]
*  having you have a goldmine of evidence here forensic evidence [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6028.1s)]
*  that will tie likely this person they arrested to that [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6032.0s)]
*  backpack in that place with the weapon at the same time. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6036.2s)]
*  So all those little pieces come together. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6040.1s)]
*  They all seem to be likely lining up in a very damning [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6043.6s)]
*  way for this person and that's what the investigators [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6047.7s)]
*  and the prosecutors to be looking at next and Andrew a [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6050.8s)]
*  very quick question before we let you go. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6053.400000000001s)]
*  They they said the suspect with his rightfully AK-47 with [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6055.8s)]
*  a scope was between 300 and 500 yards away from Trump but [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6059.6s)]
*  then they said that is not a far distance given the [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6064.900000000001s)]
*  capability of this AK-47 with a scope you agree with that [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6067.6s)]
*  that that's not a far distance. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6071.6s)]
*  It's not a far distance. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6073.2s)]
*  The rifle is definitely capable of it. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6074.5s)]
*  The scope makes it easier to do it's still going to require [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6076.5s)]
*  some degree of training and practice on the on the part [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6080.1s)]
*  of the shooter, but that's not hard to do in this country, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6083.200000000001s)]
*  right? [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6086.0s)]
*  A lot of people engage in that sort of stuff shooting sports [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6086.200000000001s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6090.200000000001s)]
*  So yeah, this is definitely a possible for a decently trained [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6090.700000000001s)]
*  marksman. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6098.400000000001s)]
*  So and it's also been done before let's not forget that in [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJZFzfEDP2k&t=6099.400000000001s)]
