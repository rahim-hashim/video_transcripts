*  I think I did it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=30.0s)]
*  I think I flipped it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=41.08s)]
*  Did you see me chat? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=42.6s)]
*  Did you hear me? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=43.84s)]
*  It's going to be quite difficult. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=44.84s)]
*  Oh, they're saying let's go jump scare. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=46.64s)]
*  What's up everybody? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=50.36s)]
*  I'm Sam Piker and this is the Osanabe Brackets going to you live from very windy Indio Coachella [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=51.36s)]
*  Valley. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=58.4s)]
*  All of those things here in California. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=59.96s)]
*  We are officially at Coachella alongside Will Neff and Archie Poo as always behind the camera. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=63.739999999999995s)]
*  We were going to slam some brews but unfortunately we can't because there's only non-alcoholic [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=71.56s)]
*  ones left. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=75.28s)]
*  But we're here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=76.28s)]
*  We did it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=77.72s)]
*  We brought in, we smuggled in our contraband and we got our passes to flick this up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=78.72s)]
*  We just met kneecap. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=87.0s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=88.8s)]
*  Great lads. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=90.24s)]
*  And we're going to be streaming their Coachella show. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=92.24s)]
*  Maybe roam around a little bit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=96.16s)]
*  And then I'm going to let March and Will go because they're aching. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=97.16s)]
*  Chat, I'm on a mission to find the yellow Yo Gabba Gabba robot and dance with him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=101.64s)]
*  Just absolutely break the wheels off. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=109.92s)]
*  Dance with him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=111.8s)]
*  He's been talking about. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=113.52s)]
*  He's not human. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=115.6s)]
*  He wants to give him a s**t job. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  He has been talking consistently about how hard he can s**t the yellow Gabba. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  I do not endorse this statement. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=127.64s)]
*  I just want to dance. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=129.32s)]

*  I just want a picture. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=134.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=135.0s)]
*  You can't s**t the Yo Gabba Gabba robot. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=136.0s)]
*  You're ruining so many people's childhood. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=141.0s)]
*  Will Neff found dead at Coachella. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=143.0s)]
*  His mouth is all tinted in yellow for no reason. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=146.4s)]
*  Will got tetanus. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=149.4s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=152.4s)]
*  No idea. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=154.4s)]
*  This seems hot, miserable and dusty. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=155.4s)]
*  Festivals do not interest me in the least, but I'm supporting because it's you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=157.4s)]
*  Blue heart, blue heart. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=160.4s)]
*  You don't have to be here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=161.4s)]
*  She can feel the dust. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=162.4s)]
*  Wait, why is the lo-fi still on? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=166.4s)]
*  Wait, the lo-fi is on still? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=168.4s)]
*  Are you guys f**king kidding me? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=173.4s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=175.8s)]
*  I think they just hear the music. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=178.8s)]
*  It's hot. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=181.8s)]
*  I think they just hear the music. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=182.8s)]
*  He's checking. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=185.8s)]
*  Are you talking about the live band behind us? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=186.8s)]

*  There is no way. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=191.8s)]
*  They just stopped. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=194.8s)]
*  I hear lo-fi and marina. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=198.8s)]
*  I don't know why lo-fi would be on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=202.8s)]
*  It's not supposed to be on in this scene. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, you don't understand the mission that I had to go through to get up here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm in the EV. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to make the distance. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  I drove through a dust bowl. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  The ship freaked me out. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  I drove up here alone this morning. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm making it seem like a treacherous trek. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  It actually was pretty chill. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  It made it with 90 to 100 extra miles left, which is pretty crazy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  I did have a couple close calls with pissing, though. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=233.6s)]
*  I feel like I've gotten old. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=236.6s)]
*  Bro, your aura is just... [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=239.6s)]
*  Man, this at a festival immediately is like, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=242.6s)]
*  I got great mileage on my EV, but I had to tinkle. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=245.6s)]
*  Bro, listen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=250.6s)]
*  I'll just say this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=252.6s)]
*  I'll just say this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=254.6s)]
*  When I was younger, I felt like I could hold my piss in for longer. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  And now that I'm older, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=261.0s)]
*  there's like, when I'm... [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=263.0s)]

*  10, 15 minutes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=271.0s)]
*  Once I feel a piss coming... [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=273.0s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=276.0s)]
*  Once I feel a piss coming, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=277.0s)]
*  I feel like... [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=280.0s)]
*  I got 15 minutes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=283.0s)]
*  Until I kind of let that shit rip. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=285.0s)]
*  You don't like my piss story? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=288.0s)]

*  So, Artists Against the Parts is a network of... [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=424.8s)]
*  Let me give you my mic. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=426.8s)]
*  Period. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=427.8s)]
*  Love it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=428.8s)]
*  We have a mini mic too so we want to do a little interview. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=429.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we can do that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=431.8s)]
*  Here. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=433.8s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=434.8s)]
*  Hey y'all, what's up? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=435.8s)]
*  Hand me a mic and we're all feeling it kind of ways. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=436.8s)]
*  Artists Against the Parts side, network of now over 15,000 artists, culture workers who [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=439.8s)]
*  stand in full solidarity with Palestine, trying to combat the misinformation, using every [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=444.8s)]
*  facet, every platform, every stage. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=450.8s)]
*  And all kinds of artists, you know, like musicians here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=454.8s)]
*  There are tons of musicians at Coachella who are speaking out about Palestine and hopefully [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=457.8s)]
*  more and more will all the time. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=460.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=462.8s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=463.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=464.8s)]
*  NECAP is a good program. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=465.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=466.8s)]
*  NECAP is like really clear with doing agitation on stage, which is like what we've been doing [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=467.8s)]
*  a lot over the last 18 months of like working with artists across the nation, honestly, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=471.8s)]
*  and like, hey, can you set up a few minutes for us to be on stage and speak with you? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=475.8s)]
*  And we've all been down. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=481.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=482.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=483.8s)]
*  So why did you come to Coachella? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=484.8s)]
*  I came here because... [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=485.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=486.8s)]
*  I came here because NECAP invited me. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=487.8s)]
*  Because last week when they were doing the agitation that you were talking about, when [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=492.8s)]
*  they were doing the demonstration, apparently their livestream got cut. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=496.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=500.8s)]
*  And I've been a fan of them for a while and I hit them up. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=501.8s)]
*  I said, listen, like, we'll make sure that that doesn't happen. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=503.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=506.8s)]
*  You know? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=507.8s)]
*  So we're here. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=508.8s)]
*  We're going to be livestreaming the performance and we're very excited. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=509.8s)]
*  They're great. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=513.8s)]
*  They're awesome. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=514.8s)]
*  They're really good. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=515.8s)]
*  It's such an important moment because, you know, like Mahoud Khalil and the work that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=516.8s)]
*  he's done, it can't be repressed in the way that it is right now. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=521.8s)]
*  And we have to, like, we can't have livestreams be cut because we have to speak out and show [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=524.8s)]
*  that everybody is standing with Mahoud and all of the students. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=528.8s)]
*  And we're going to keep saying free Palestine until it's free. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=532.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=535.8s)]
*  We're not going to give up. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=536.8s)]
*  Who are the artists that you guys are here with? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=537.8s)]
*  Here, let's maybe move somewhere where we're not in the entry way. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=540.8s)]
*  Like right here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=545.8s)]
*  Who are the artists that you guys came here with? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=548.8s)]
*  We're with Blonde Redhead right now, who have been super supportive of Palestine as well. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=554.8s)]
*  They're amazing and we're excited to see their performance tomorrow as well. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=561.8s)]
*  A lot of the other artists have been amazing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=565.8s)]
*  A lot of the other artists have been vocal and it's a shift that we've been seeing really [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=570.8s)]
*  consciously over the last 18 months that the whole world stands with Palestine, including [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=575.8s)]
*  the sector of arts and culture workers. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=580.8s)]
*  There's really no hiding from it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=582.8s)]
*  And so right now we were with the Secret Souls and they were really clear on stage. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=584.8s)]
*  They were like, ended, et cetera. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=588.8s)]
*  And Sean Puthi is also an amazing, he signed the Artists Against the B****d statement right [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=590.8s)]
*  away when we released it in October of 2023. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=595.8s)]
*  And he talks, you know, he has these amazing images of Malcolm X behind him while he's [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=599.8s)]
*  performing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=603.8s)]
*  It shows there's internationalism that's at its heart. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=604.8s)]
*  It's not just Palestine, it's liberation for everyone. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=608.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=610.8s)]
*  Do you have something to say? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=611.8s)]
*  Just thank you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=613.8s)]
*  Thank you for speaking up, for using your platform as we all should be doing right now [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=614.8s)]
*  in a moment where all people are being liberated. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=620.8s)]
*  I try. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=624.8s)]
*  It feels like it's not enough, but... [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=625.8s)]
*  As long as everybody's trying, you know, and all the artists, all the personalities that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=629.8s)]
*  have a platform, as long as everybody is speaking up, you know, like when we think 10, 20, 50 [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=634.8s)]
*  years from now, what did you say during a livestream, you know? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=640.8s)]
*  Like, I would want to say that I said and did something about it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=647.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=652.8s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=653.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=654.8s)]
*  You say you got some gifts for me? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=655.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=656.8s)]
*  Oh, but they're literally about to go off. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=657.8s)]
*  So I gotta head your way now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=658.8s)]
*  Yeah, later. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=659.8s)]
*  This is an artist against the antenna. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=660.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=662.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=663.8s)]
*  And I've got...I got a PYM t-shirt for you. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=664.8s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=671.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=672.8s)]
*  Enjoy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=673.8s)]
*  Oh, this is sick. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=674.8s)]
*  Do you know what this is? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=675.8s)]
*  The Palestinian Youth Movement? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=678.8s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=679.8s)]
*  The imagery, the statement. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=680.8s)]
*  The imagery is, I don't know where it's from. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=683.8s)]
*  I suspect maybe it's the second Intifada? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=685.8s)]
*  No. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=690.8s)]
*  So it's just a flint or combat tank. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=691.8s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I got that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=694.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=696.8s)]
*  Grown plans through it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=697.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=698.8s)]
*  Basically saying our people are gonna prevail and at the end of the day they will remain [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=699.8s)]
*  on their land. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=704.8s)]
*  Here's some other art I get. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=705.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=708.8s)]
*  This is the back of it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=710.8s)]
*  It explains what the network is now. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=711.8s)]
*  And so, you know, during the time of South African apartheid, there was a movement of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=713.8s)]
*  artists united against apartheid. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=719.8s)]
*  We get a lot of inspiration from that as well. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=720.8s)]
*  And we know that there's gonna be a long struggle ahead, but really like the battle is one of [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=723.8s)]
*  consciousness. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=728.8s)]
*  And now we're really winning. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=729.8s)]
*  I think we're winning. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=730.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=733.8s)]
*  I mean, there's definitely a tight shift, for sure. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=734.8s)]
*  I have my mic. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=737.8s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=738.8s)]
*  There's definitely a tight shift in comparison to where things were, I would say, 10 years [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=739.8s)]
*  ago. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=744.8s)]
*  I've been very outspoken about these issues for a past decade. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=745.8s)]
*  And post-October 7, there's definitely been a lot of attention. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=748.8s)]
*  Initially, at first, at least from what I saw, a lot of people were shocked at my reaction [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=753.8s)]
*  to the situation as opposed to like what the mainstream media's opinion was. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=761.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=766.8s)]
*  And it was almost like a whiplash that people felt. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=767.8s)]
*  Where they were like, what do you mean that you're still standing with the Palestinians? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=769.8s)]
*  Like they've done this heinous thing. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=773.8s)]
*  And I was like, there's a reason for this. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=775.8s)]
*  And I think it's important to recognize how this violence happens, that it does not materialize [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=778.8s)]
*  out of thin air, out of the blue, out of nowhere. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=785.8s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=789.8s)]
*  And now so many more people a year in are very familiar with all of the atrocities that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=792.8s)]
*  Israel has committed. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=800.8s)]
*  And it's the mainstream position to stand with Palestine. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=801.8s)]
*  It's like the position that everyone should have, but it's also the position that more [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=805.8s)]
*  and more people are having. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=809.8s)]
*  It's weird and it's wrong to not stand with Palestine at this moment. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=811.8s)]
*  I think we have to keep pushing that line because the mainstream media likes to tell [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=816.8s)]
*  a different story. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=819.8s)]
*  What we're seeing is a different reality. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=821.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=824.8s)]
*  And that's their function, the mainstream media. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=825.8s)]
*  Their function is to keep showing what the oppressor, the capitalist, the empire wants [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=827.8s)]
*  people to see. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=834.8s)]
*  But with social media and with the live stream genocide, it's really hard to keep that narrative. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=836.8s)]
*  And we know where people will stand. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=843.8s)]
*  And that's what they oppressed. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=846.8s)]
*  We had the action on April 5th and you were there. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=849.8s)]
*  What was that like for you? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=852.8s)]
*  It was a really key moment too with Mahmoud's arrest and Mesas Thurk and other students. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=854.8s)]
*  It's always great to go out to protests. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=860.8s)]
*  That's why I tell people to participate all the time because you feel emboldened, you [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=864.8s)]
*  feel galvanized, you see other people that are like-minded and you recognize that you're [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=868.8s)]
*  not alone. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=872.8s)]
*  You're not alone in your thoughts. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=873.8s)]
*  I know that we do a lot of community organizing online, but it's good to also do this in the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=875.8s)]
*  real world. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=884.8s)]
*  And to put bodies in space to show up and become an undeniable force. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=885.8s)]
*  And I think that's precisely what's happened. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=891.8s)]
*  Anyway, we're probably going to move soon because they're going to go on stage soon. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=893.8s)]
*  So I'm going to- [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=897.8s)]
*  Nice to meet you guys. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=899.8s)]
*  Thank you for everything. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=900.8s)]
*  We need to do a little interlude. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=901.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=904.8s)]
*  Right now, right after. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=905.8s)]
*  Yeah, maybe after. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=906.8s)]
*  It's like two minutes. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=907.8s)]
*  Alright, we can rip it right now I think. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=908.8s)]
*  Right now? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=911.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know when. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=912.8s)]
*  Wait, let me see where I can put this first. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=914.8s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=917.8s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=918.8s)]
*  Where did Will go? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=919.8s)]
*  Next point. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=923.8s)]
*  Oh, Will's there. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=924.8s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=925.8s)]
*  Okay, so we have a banner that's like for a million other students. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=926.8s)]
*  And I feel like we'll go to the front of the page and we'll have it out. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=929.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=930.8s)]
*  Because we're doing this every day. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=931.8s)]
*  Do you think they still stream it? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=932.8s)]
*  Yes, I'm still streaming. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=933.8s)]
*  On all times? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=934.8s)]
*  Yes, it's always on. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=935.8s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=936.8s)]
*  I feel like it's been a while since I've done this. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=937.8s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=938.8s)]
*  I've been on it for a while. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=939.8s)]
*  And I feel like it's been a while. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=940.8s)]
*  I feel like it's been a while. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=941.8s)]
*  I'm going to go to the front of the page and we'll have it out. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=942.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=949.8s)]
*  Because we're doing this every day. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=950.8s)]
*  Yes, I'm still streaming. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=951.8s)]
*  On all times? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=952.8s)]
*  Yes, it's always on. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=953.8s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=954.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm used to it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=955.8s)]
*  You're used to it now, aren't you? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=956.8s)]
*  It doesn't turn off until it's completely off. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=957.8s)]
*  But yeah, no, if you... [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=958.8s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=959.8s)]
*  We'll be there though. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=960.8s)]
*  All right, perfect. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=961.8s)]
*  I'm just telling you, get your camera on that side. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=962.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=963.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=965.8s)]
*  Chad, I'm pointing at the ground because we're in an artist area and I don't want to put [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=966.8s)]
*  a camera in people's faces that think they're in a private area. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=971.8s)]
*  That's why I'm pointing at the floor, just so you know. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=974.8s)]
*  What? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=977.8s)]
*  Why are you putting this? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=978.8s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=979.8s)]
*  I love you. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=980.8s)]
*  I'm putting that shit on. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=981.8s)]
*  It's no big deal. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=982.8s)]
*  It's no biggie. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=983.8s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=984.8s)]
*  What? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=985.8s)]
*  All right, let's do it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=987.8s)]
*  Go to the stands here. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=988.8s)]
*  No, it's all good. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=989.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=990.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=991.8s)]
*  Should we move to maybe a different... [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=992.8s)]
*  Yeah, let's move somewhere else. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=993.8s)]
*  ...the back. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=994.8s)]
*  You can get it in panel. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=995.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=996.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=997.8s)]
*  This will be good. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=998.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=999.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1000.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1001.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1002.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1003.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1004.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1005.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1006.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1007.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1008.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1009.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1010.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1011.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1012.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1013.8s)]
*  This will be good. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1015.8s)]
*  All right, amazing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1016.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1017.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1018.8s)]
*  Tasman Faker, you're at Coachella. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1019.8s)]
*  You're about to livestream NECAP's performance. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1022.8s)]
*  Why do you think it's important that you're here with artists and cultural workers who [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1024.8s)]
*  stand in solidarity with Palestine? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1028.8s)]
*  Well, the boys were kind enough to invite me out here, so I'm excited to show some support, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1031.8s)]
*  show some love. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1037.8s)]
*  They deserve it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1038.8s)]
*  They've been very outspoken on a lot of issues that are very near and dear to me, Palestine [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1039.8s)]
*  included. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1044.8s)]
*  So I'm excited to see what they are going to do. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1045.8s)]
*  What do you think is the role of artists in this moment to use their platforms at every [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1049.8s)]
*  turn and every place? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1054.8s)]
*  I think that there are unspeakable crimes against humanity happening right now that Israel [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1056.8s)]
*  is committing with our tax dollars, our U.S. tax dollars. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1061.8s)]
*  So anyone and everyone with a voice should be using it every moment. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1065.8s)]
*  I think about it a lot. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1070.8s)]
*  I can't get it out of my head. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1071.8s)]
*  I feel a deep sense of shame at all points. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1073.8s)]
*  And I think that this at least helps me feel, it helps my conscience be clean for as long [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1076.8s)]
*  as I can. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1086.8s)]
*  And right now we're seeing some increased repression from the administration on our [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1087.8s)]
*  movements. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1091.8s)]
*  We're seeing the attacks on the students, against immigrants, deportations. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1092.8s)]
*  What do you think about that and why is it more important than ever right now to be standing [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1097.8s)]
*  up for the people of Palestine? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1101.8s)]
*  You can try to silence people all day every day for as long as you want, but you can't [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1102.8s)]
*  change the truth. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1107.8s)]
*  So I think that this kind of suppression, this kind of oppression will beget resistance. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1109.8s)]
*  It will embolden people. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1116.8s)]
*  And I think everyone, especially on the pro-Palestinian side, know that their cause is just and they're [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1118.8s)]
*  going to keep on fighting, myself included. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1124.8s)]
*  Free Palestine. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1127.8s)]
*  Free Palestine. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1128.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=1129.8s)]

*  I looked. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5100.88s)]
*  That's a work of art. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5101.88s)]
*  It's like the beer in a cartoon. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5102.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5105.88s)]

*  Chad. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5126.88s)]
*  You'll probably see footage of me being very awkward on stage. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5129.88s)]
*  Don't make fun of me too much. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5133.88s)]
*  I didn't know what to do. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5135.88s)]

*  It was sick. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5143.88s)]
*  It's hard to match their energy because they're wild. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5144.88s)]
*  I was going to want to get in their way, but also I don't think they gave a shit. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5146.88s)]
*  That too. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5149.88s)]

*  I should have done that. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5156.88s)]
*  You might have killed people. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5159.88s)]
*  Yeah, they would have needed at least a few people to catch you. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5161.88s)]
*  Oh. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5166.88s)]
*  I did not go as blonde redhead, Chad. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5168.88s)]
*  I did something very nice for one of the dudes working for kneecap, working with kneecap. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5171.88s)]
*  Also, I... [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5186.88s)]
*  This is the other side of the... [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5189.88s)]
*  This is the other thing that also makes me very awkward. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5192.88s)]
*  Sometimes people are... [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5195.88s)]
*  Like, we're here. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5196.88s)]
*  Obviously, everyone here is an artist and shit. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5197.88s)]
*  Sure. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5199.88s)]
*  And the expectation is that you know their work and you can say something about it. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5200.88s)]
*  And it's just like, how do I tell people that I'm an autistic man who doesn't listen to music? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5206.88s)]
*  I think if you have any expectations... [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5211.88s)]
*  If you have enough of those, the expectations will disappear. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5214.88s)]
*  That's why I'm just slamming you. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5217.88s)]
*  I think you just be your normal human self. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5218.88s)]
*  Put your best foot forward. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5220.88s)]
*  And if you know it, you know it, and if you don't, well then I'm excited to hear it. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5222.88s)]
*  Because you can. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5226.88s)]
*  What did you say? [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5230.88s)]
*  What did you say? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5231.88s)]
*  At least we can. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5232.88s)]
*  Mark's just out of control. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5234.88s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5236.88s)]
*  Oh. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5237.88s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5238.88s)]
*  Yeah, Mark's just out of control. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5240.88s)]
*  Yeah, he's not mic'd up, so it's fine. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5242.88s)]
*  No one heard him. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5244.88s)]
*  It was some random person walking by that said that, that sounded a lot like Mark, but it wasn't him. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5245.88s)]
*  And you can never prove that, and I will always deny it. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5251.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5254.88s)]
*  So... [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5256.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting cold. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5259.88s)]
*  Bro, work. I'm trying to tell you work. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5260.88s)]
*  It says severe weather, windy. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5262.88s)]
*  We are so cold. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5265.88s)]
*  At least I'm glad I have the pants on still. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5268.88s)]
*  I'm gonna be out there. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5270.88s)]
*  It's cold. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5274.88s)]
*  Alright, so are we gonna go on in there, or are we gonna cut it? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5278.88s)]
*  Let's see, I don't know, I don't wanna fucking put a camera on their face while they're chilling. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5282.88s)]
*  Are they trying to grab her right now? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5291.88s)]
*  Oh, that's... [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5294.88s)]
*  Oh, I think they're linking up now to say what up to each other. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5296.88s)]
*  Yeah, let me show you. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5300.88s)]
*  Hmm? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5304.88s)]
*  That's also the other reason why I did that. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5305.88s)]
*  That was tight. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5309.88s)]
*  Don't you? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5310.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5311.88s)]
*  A lot of those songs, somebody denied me on. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5313.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5315.88s)]
*  Ooh, buddy. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5318.88s)]
*  Was that stream? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5319.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5321.88s)]
*  And now it's time. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5322.88s)]
*  Are you sure? Cause I saw some people check their live stream. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5323.88s)]
*  Wait, they cut their stream again? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5325.88s)]
*  No, I don't know. I don't wanna double check that. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5327.88s)]
*  Well, chat, did they actually put it on the live stream, or did they cut their live stream? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5329.88s)]
*  I mean, that's the reason why I literally drove out here. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5333.88s)]
*  I drove out here because I wanted to make sure that they got their whole fucking stream. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5336.88s)]
*  Even if it was not live. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5341.88s)]
*  Oh, they don't stream that stage? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5345.88s)]
*  It wasn't streamed at all, but they streamed it last week. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5349.88s)]
*  Tight. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5354.88s)]
*  That means that that stream didn't exist on your channel. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5355.88s)]
*  It's Facebook. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5358.88s)]
*  Oh, they switched it. They usually stream that stage. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5362.88s)]
*  They are streaming Yuma instead of Sonora in Weekend 2. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5368.88s)]
*  Dude. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5372.88s)]
*  I'm ready for the prodigy now. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5374.88s)]
*  In my heart, I can... [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5376.88s)]
*  I'm gonna be so real. I got like 10 minutes before I got 10 minutes. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5379.88s)]
*  Marsh, in my soul, I just hear... [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5380.88s)]
*  Yeah, um... [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5382.88s)]
*  Let's... [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5385.88s)]
*  Let's add the tour manager. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5387.88s)]
*  What? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5389.88s)]
*  Let's ask the tour manager. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5390.88s)]
*  I also don't know what to do with all this stuff. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5392.88s)]
*  Throw it in there. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5394.88s)]
*  Yeah, throw it in the chair. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5395.88s)]
*  He's gonna get back. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5396.88s)]
*  100%. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5397.88s)]
*  Will we be able to get back in here? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5398.88s)]
*  Yeah, more space. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5399.88s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5400.88s)]
*  But it's... [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5401.88s)]
*  It's just a... [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5402.88s)]
*  It's a... [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5403.88s)]
*  It's a... [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5404.88s)]
*  It's a... [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5405.88s)]
*  It's a... [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5406.88s)]
*  It's a... [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5407.88s)]
*  It's a... [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5408.88s)]
*  It's a... [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5409.88s)]
*  It's a... [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5410.88s)]
*  Should we... [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5412.88s)]
*  Should we just roam? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5413.88s)]
*  With the... [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5415.88s)]
*  I think you will get clapped. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5416.88s)]
*  Wait, why? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5418.88s)]
*  What? What do you mean? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5420.88s)]
*  I'm leaving it with 100%. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5421.88s)]
*  You can roam. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5425.88s)]
*  You just wanna go... [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5427.88s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5428.88s)]
*  If you wanna go, we can cut it. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5429.88s)]
*  Well, I have to. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5430.88s)]
*  No, I... [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5431.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5432.88s)]

*  That's true. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5435.88s)]
*  What do you wanna do? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5437.88s)]
*  I mean, you guys can stay where you want. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5438.88s)]
*  What do you want? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5439.88s)]
*  Ba-da-bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, ba-bam. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5440.88s)]
*  What do you wanna do? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5441.88s)]
*  Breathe with me? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5443.88s)]
*  No, but that's... [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5445.88s)]
*  That's a 10. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5446.88s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5447.88s)]
*  I'm just... [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5448.88s)]
*  It's prep work till then. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5449.88s)]
*  Okay, but what do you wanna do till then, is what I'm saying. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5450.88s)]
*  The Marias? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5452.88s)]
*  To the Marias. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5453.88s)]
*  To the Marias. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5454.88s)]
*  This is my Puerto Rican queen. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5455.88s)]
*  It's heritage. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5456.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5457.88s)]
*  Authentico. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5458.88s)]
*  Authentico. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5459.88s)]
*  Chad, DJ Mustard also asked me to participate. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5464.88s)]
*  I'm not even joking when I say this, and I have no fucking clue why. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5468.88s)]
*  And I don't... [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5472.88s)]
*  Turn the TV off. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5474.88s)]
*  Turn the TV off. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5475.88s)]
*  And I don't know what that would entail, and I'm scared. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5476.88s)]
*  And I'm not going to obviously stream that, because that would be... [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5480.88s)]
*  That's like 11. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5483.88s)]
*  You just do it. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5484.88s)]
*  No, no, it's all the way until 11, which is why I'm not going to do that. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5485.88s)]
*  But... [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5490.88s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5495.88s)]
*  We're at a festival, buddy. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5497.88s)]
*  Time to go do festival things. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5498.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5500.88s)]
*  We can come back for the bags. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5503.88s)]
*  We don't have to run it. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aghcgplu3I&t=5504.88s)]
