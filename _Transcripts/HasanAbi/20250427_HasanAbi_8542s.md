# The Truth About The West Bank Through Louis Theroux’s Eyes | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8)
*  chatter is going to encounter someone who also has the same exact opinions as me who thinks like Israel is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=0.0s)]
*  Say doing which is the truth right and be like, oh, well this person also must be funded by Qatar [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6.12s)]
*  Yeah, Arabs rule the media Arabs [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=11.82s)]
*  rule the media has [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=16.12s)]
*  rules the media and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=19.84s)]
*  Thank you for my lovers and haters setting off a massive sequence of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=23.36s)]
*  Hype trains every time [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=28.2s)]
*  All right, we have this because I think we're quite deep inside what I call the Palestinian territories [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  This is Louis Thoreau for those of you don't know he's an incredible incredible [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=40.92s)]
*  documentarian and apparently he did a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=46.44s)]
*  documentary on the settlers in the West Bank and I am very [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=50.2s)]
*  excited [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  To watch it. He's fantastic [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=57.72s)]
*  We've watched a bunch of his we watched a bunch of his other [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  doco's and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  You're in for a treat. I [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  Suspect if he goes actually pretty crazy [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  I suspect that if he goes after assume he will because Israel is fairly irredeemable [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  That they might even take this documentary down potentially I mean it is about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=79.52s)]
*  occupied [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=85.08s)]
*  Palestinian territories in the West Bank, so that is definitely more appropriate. That's more permissible in the Western world [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=87.28s)]
*  Your takes today have been questionable not gonna lie about what yeah BBC literally [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=95.24s)]
*  Banned the last doco on Palestine, but that to be fair that was in Gaza. That's what I mean [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=101.44s)]
*  I haven't even gotten the takes yet. I doubt it Luis Thoreau communicates very well with the freaks [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=105.36s)]
*  I feel like he'll just let them speak out and say some heinous shit unprovoked. Yeah [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=110.72s)]
*  Quite deep inside what I call the Palestinian territories [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=114.32s)]
*  What you call the Palestinian territories? I call it the heart of Judea [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  If you say the Palestinian territories, you're essentially already saying that this right here [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=122.08s)]
*  right here is going to be a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=128.04s)]
*  jihadist [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=131.0s)]
*  Palestinian state right in the heart of it, dude. I love I love hearing the the authentic I [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=132.24s)]
*  Love hearing the authentic Middle Eastern accent, okay, I love to hear it. It's beautiful [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=139.6s)]
*  you know the the authentic [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  accent of the Levant a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Man from Long Island Israel not only the heart of Israel. We're talking about like what you're looking at [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Why are you jihadist? Why not? Why couldn't it just be a Palestinian state? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay to understand the Arab way of thinking that they understand there's a war they win the war if they get [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=158.72s)]
*  Territory they lose the war if they lose territory you could flip that and say bro. That's literally he's he's describing why he's there [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=166.36s)]
*  You are an American settler in occupied Palestinian territory [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=174.92s)]
*  You're just projecting your own ambition to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=180.56s)]
*  everyday Palestinian [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=184.8s)]
*  Existence that's all he's doing. It's like yeah, you know, you know how them Arabs are always trying to take territories [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=186.72s)]
*  What do you mean why are you here right now you're not from here you're from long island [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=193.28s)]
*  Why that man's definitely for oyster Bay Long Island that like why they will that's what in a sense you're doing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  That's what I aspire to do. That's what I aspire to do [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=205.68s)]
*  Beyond the eastern edge of Israel is the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. Yeah. Yeah, he wants that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=215.36s)]
*  He wants to adopt the Arab mindset of taking over land [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=221.84s)]
*  Which is really interesting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=228.4s)]
*  Because I think it's it's more so that these guys just want to live on their ancestral homeland, you know [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=231.36s)]
*  It was occupied in war by Israel in 1967 [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  Since then hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers have moved here illegally under international law [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  Among them the group of religious nationalists who see it as their divine right to build a greater Israel [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  Drive out the Palestinians have been here for generations [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=261.32s)]
*  Made a film about them in 2011 [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  But now since the attack of October 7th, I'd heard that they were accelerating the settlement process [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=272.36s)]
*  Why are you filming me while being protected by the Israeli military [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=278.5s)]
*  I'd come to try to understand their mindset and to see the consequences of their ultra nationalist vision up close [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=285.46s)]
*  They don't see us as equal human being who deserve the same rights they do [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=296.18s)]
*  Why are you filming me no politic no politic here no politic Israel number one [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=300.94s)]
*  Am Israel high no politic here. I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=308.3s)]
*  Was close to Israel's southern border [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=313.98s)]
*  And a straight up straight up straight up straight up like obviously Zionism is is a fascist ideology [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=316.78s)]
*  It's a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=323.26s)]
*  Fascist ideology [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=325.26s)]
*  It's a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=327.26s)]
*  Sinist is built around [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=328.26s)]
*  Ethno-religious supremacy and I think that's part of the reason why like the more invested you get [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=330.5s)]
*  In this framework and the more invested like the more loyal of a soldier you become in this cause [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=335.85999999999996s)]
*  the more [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  unimaginably a new person [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=343.38s)]
*  like sure, I already have a lot of calcified resentment as a consequence of being [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=345.38s)]
*  Someone who is an advocate for Palestinian emancipation for the past decade [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  But I think like the average person that has not really thought about this stuff at all when they see something like this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=357.29999999999995s)]
*  They go. What are you saying and doing? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  You know what? I mean? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=370.02s)]
*  Because this is almost medieval like some of the some of the advocacy is like only stuff that you have seen [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=371.02s)]
*  in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  History books, you know [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=380.18s)]
*  Like I'm thinking about the average person and some of you can actually explain to me [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=382.7s)]
*  Because you are this person that I'm talking about right like or you were this person that I'm talking about like there is a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=388.54s)]
*  moment [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=396.62s)]
*  For many of you in this chat where it clicked where you went [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=397.66s)]
*  Oh my god, is this guy just saying what I think he's saying and I feel like [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  I [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=408.42s)]
*  Feel like there is that moment in the hearts and minds of a lot of people in the Western world where like they just [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=410.18s)]
*  They had a moment where they were just like oh, dude. This is [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=417.78s)]
*  completely untenable [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=421.5s)]
*  You know, this is this is so gross like even on the aesthetics side of things even not not necessarily just the output [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=423.58s)]
*  but [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=432.3s)]
*  But more so just like the the arrogance and the entitlement that is presented by a lot of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=433.74s)]
*  the people that defend this project [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=440.46s)]
*  where [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  For many I think it was Yakub [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=445.38s)]
*  Jacob that I think he was also from Long Island ironically enough that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=448.42s)]
*  straight up stole the backyard and the in the outhouse of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=454.26s)]
*  Al-Qurd family in occupied East Jerusalem is she chara and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=459.3s)]
*  That video I think played a major role in people's attitudes changing where they just saw this guy being like well [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=463.98s)]
*  If I don't steal it somebody else will like like that that like there are moments like that that I think are pivotal for a lot [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=470.5s)]
*  Of people when they see it [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=476.98s)]
*  So I guess the point that I'm making is you know, the greatest warrior for the anti-zionist cause [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=478.42s)]
*  Is Michael Rappaport? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=486.70000000000005s)]
*  The greatest warrior for the anti-zionist cause is Amy Schumer the greatest warrior for the anti-zionist cause is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=489.02000000000004s)]
*  Rabbi Schmooley, it's just people who are so [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  Insane [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  That have completely lost their minds and don't even try to present like a reasonable position [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=502.06s)]
*  Because I think when people see stuff like that when people see like Michael Rappaport spitting [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=508.78000000000003s)]
*  on a microphone crying about how [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=514.58s)]
*  He can't get a job in Hollywood anymore because he's too pro-israel [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=518.02s)]
*  That is to the average person first they go [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=522.9799999999999s)]
*  Dude, why should I give up about you're getting a job? Okay, you're a Hollywood actor [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=526.9s)]
*  I don't give a shit about that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=532.5s)]
*  The second question that those people also have is what do you mean you are are you are you saying? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  Hollywood is anti-jew is that am I hearing what you are putting out there correctly? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=541.02s)]
*  Like Hollywood is anti-israel. It's anti-semitic and anti-israel Hollywood [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=546.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like you're not gonna be able to convince a lot of people that aren't already [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=551.9399999999999s)]
*  Drinking the same in Kool-Aid with that kind of attitude. You know what I mean? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=556.9s)]
*  so I think videos like this do actually play an active role and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=562.2199999999999s)]
*  In causing people to just have that wake-up moment where they go. Oh my god. This is so ridiculous [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=566.2199999999999s)]
*  Tourists were surveying the ruins of Gaza [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=573.38s)]
*  The Palestinian toll at this point was more than forty three thousand and rising [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=577.54s)]
*  In a war that had commenced a year earlier after Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli communities [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  Killing more than a thousand and taking hundreds more hostage [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=589.66s)]

*  Therefore there's a lot of resentment there [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=1619.06s)]
*  But also because they're seen as like freeloaders a [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=1621.7s)]

*  What do you mean like this no, I call his aides [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2731.38s)]
*  So the idea is to force the government by putting people [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2736.9s)]
*  Starts with small settlements then they get bigger then they get recognized by the state of israel and basically creating a new demographic [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2741.62s)]

*  It's not realistic [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2774.5s)]
*  Good [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2777.54s)]
*  We will make it realistic [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2779.06s)]
*  It's not forcing the government. It's helping the government [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2781.46s)]
*  it's [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2786.34s)]
*  Step number one one in politics. You don't force the government you give the government the courage the ability [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2787.2200000000003s)]

*  There was something unsettling about hearing daniella's ethno-nationalist vision being laid out so plainly [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2810.7400000000002s)]
*  I hope you guys are aware, but she is 100% right. Obviously. She's a freak [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2817.7000000000003s)]

*  But she is when she says benjamin netanyahu agrees with me 100% but can't say it openly [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2827.22s)]
*  But don't worry. We are still loyal soldiers [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2834.58s)]
*  Of the government and we will enact this vision [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2838.5s)]
*  That part is absolutely correct [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2841.9399999999996s)]
*  She is [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2846.5s)]
*  That was 100% all facts no printer, I mean that's [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2847.94s)]
*  You saw it's not like it's hidden. There's a fucking there's a military [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2851.94s)]
*  Dormitory right next to the fucking settlement. How'd that happen? How is it? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2856.7200000000003s)]
*  that [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2861.62s)]
*  How is it that these guys always go and do their pogroms where they will first spray paint a house with the star of david? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2862.98s)]
*  Again, okay, and then though that means that you know, the house is going to be [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2872.02s)]
*  the house is going to be [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2877.14s)]
*  ethnically cleansed [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2879.54s)]
*  So then the other dudes that you just saw the young ones that you just saw will go up to the house and torch it [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2881.7s)]
*  And then all of a sudden the idf is right there. It's not and the idf is not there to to put out the fire [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2889.06s)]
*  The idf is there to defend the settlers. How did they catch wind of this operation? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2895.22s)]
*  How did they know where to be? It's because they're working side by side [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2900.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not a coincidence [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2904.82s)]
*  It is by design [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2906.66s)]
*  This is how it works in the west bank [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2908.2599999999998s)]
*  They're there to shoot the palestinians that dare resist or they're sometimes there to shoot the palestinians that aren't even resisting [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2911.46s)]
*  But they can present as resisting they're there to stop the ambulances [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2918.34s)]
*  That are supposed to make their way to treat the palestinians that have been shot by either the settlers [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2923.54s)]
*  or the israeli occupying force [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2930.5s)]
*  So make no mistake. She's absolutely correct when she says that that they're working side by side with the government. That is the reality [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=2933.2999999999997s)]

*  after shooting someone [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=3958.5s)]
*  It's the same shit and the guiding principle is also the same the idea that [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=3960.58s)]
*  The idea that these guys are somehow in a totally different category and it's anti-semitic to make this to draw this comparison is [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=3966.2599999999998s)]
*  A laughable notion at least at this point, especially at this point [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=3973.46s)]
*  They are screaming to us [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=3981.7s)]

*  That's the laser on the rifles [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=3990.1s)]
*  So it's happening most every day what do we do just stay in here? Yeah, we are inside [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=3995.94s)]
*  Matan what do you think but not safe at the moment there's obviously multiple guns pointing at us. Yeah, let's wait [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4007.2999999999997s)]

*  No, because I mean we raised in this situation. So it became an abnormal reality for us [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4030.5s)]
*  When you are a kid, you just see this army invading your home in the day on the night you grow up on this [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4035.38s)]
*  Unjustice reality that it became not normal for anybody and no one should accept it [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4042.3199999999997s)]
*  After more than an hour the soldiers appeared to lose interest and the crew and I slipped away [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4047.3s)]
*  The violence committed by some settlers is often justified by them as a response to violence they experience from palestinians [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4063.78s)]
*  Which is a very common thing in the country [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4071.46s)]
*  A response to violence they experience from palestinians, which is much less frequent [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4073.46s)]
*  Nevertheless, it's hard to disentangle it from an ideology of the superiority of one group and their rights over another [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4080.1s)]
*  Promoted by leaders like daniella weiss [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4087.7s)]
*  Hiya, how are you? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4092.26s)]

*  There's there's been so many different versions of this documentary the reason why it's allowed to air [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4135.48s)]
*  Is because there have been a thousand of these and nothing has changed [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4143.72s)]
*  part of the reason why this is allowed to air as opposed to the gaza stuff is because the cruelty in gaza is is [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4149.48s)]
*  unavoidable [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4156.18s)]
*  And the world's perspective on west bank settlements is is you know, it's illegal. It's done [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4158.28s)]
*  There's nothing you can say about it [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4164.04s)]
*  they will the world will have a similar perspective if the icj court case if the [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4165.64s)]
*  icj court case [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4171.14s)]
*  comes down [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4173.8s)]
*  And declares israel to be doing a genocide. You will probably see a lot more of this kind of documentary in gaza as well [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4175.24s)]
*  Because a lot of these institutions move with permission structures [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4183.719999999999s)]
*  That's why I don't discount how important it was that in the month of april and in the month of february 2021 [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4188.599999999999s)]

*  This is the role she played when she went into a raid in ramallah [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4249.56s)]
*  Yes, that is true, but there is no reason to consistently bring it up over and over and over again [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=4254.280000000001s)]

*  Palestinian land, okay. They've been stopped how many times now? [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6158.76s)]
*  This is not israeli land [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6164.7s)]
*  this is [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6166.86s)]
*  An illegal occupation. This is all palestinian land and i'm not saying like oh all of israel's palestinian land [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6168.46s)]
*  i'm not doing that i'm saying like this is [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6175.42s)]
*  Completely beyond the green line. This is straightforwardly [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6178.06s)]
*  a place where every single military member that you see is an illegal [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6182.3s)]
*  Military member an illegal occupier, okay. This is hebron. It's so crazy that this is like and by the way, this is the nicest [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6188.3s)]
*  That they're behaving around a random palestinian [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6197.34s)]
*  Because there's a white guy there with a bbc logo and a camera team [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6200.94s)]
*  Okay [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6206.0599999999995s)]

*  If he lives here, he can't reach here. No [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6229.98s)]

*  It's [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6240.38s)]
*  It seems ironic that that's the visitor center right for tourists and whatnot and and he can't actually [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6245.02s)]
*  Visit in his own in his own city [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6251.82s)]

*  Yeah, this is what madaglacius saw and said was morally indefensible [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6262.38s)]
*  Only uh, but it took him like a decade to change [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6266.54s)]
*  His position on this. Uh, he I don't think he considers this to be morally indefensible any longer [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6270.38s)]
*  Madaglacius ironically recently wanted this exact structure to take place in america [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6276.3s)]
*  He recently tweeted about how egg boy the other egg boy not mark andreason [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6281.82s)]
*  But madaglacius recently tweeted out that we should just have a national id card [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6285.82s)]
*  And that cops should ask you for your national id card at every checkpoint [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6291.74s)]
*  Around the country [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6296.240000000001s)]
*  I think that's also a part of the reason another part of the reason why a lot of americans also like israel and defend israel like a [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6297.360000000001s)]

*  americans do [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6305.52s)]
*  Because they kind of want [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6306.8s)]
*  To to do israel shit in america, you know against [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6309.76s)]

*  Of enemy here in this uh in this situation. Yeah here [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6320.56s)]
*  Madaglot about once famously wrote about how fucking inhumane this apartheid was when he visited, uh [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6324.48s)]
*  Recently posted this I am sort of open to the idea that we should be a country with a national id card system [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6332.48s)]
*  And a rule that you're expected to have your papers on you at all times in case your citizenship is challenged [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6337.12s)]
*  But if that's what conservatives want we need to create that card [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6341.76s)]
*  Yeah papers, please but liberal but not in a chinese way [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6345.36s)]

*  Taking more and more land. It's about fragmented life restricted life for palestinians [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6368.96s)]
*  No quality life you live with the basics with the base even with less than basics of family need [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6374.58s)]
*  To make you live and they are doing well the majority of the houses are empty [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6383.06s)]
*  The families are leaving [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6389.46s)]

*  The whole of hebron or at least this area they could literally deport [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6396.1s)]

*  Yeah, just like my fucking uh hasan abi heads some of them have uh their accounts labeled as parody accounts [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6434.18s)]

*  It's a it's different areas areas b and c and a are different parts of the west bank because it's all been [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6466.9800000000005s)]
*  Sectioned off like this through settlements [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6472.900000000001s)]
*  You see [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6475.780000000001s)]
*  All the purple dots and all the purple squares on this map are settlements and the settlement outposts. They are bantastans [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6476.9800000000005s)]
*  Similar to apartheid south africa that have cordoned off. He's here in hebron. They're completely surrounded if you noticed by design [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6484.12s)]
*  by jewish settlements [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6493.8s)]

*  from their allies [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6499.96s)]

*  It should be mentioned that the reason there is illegal activity in areas is because israel denies over 90 of the permits on palestinian land [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6502.36s)]
*  to the palestinians, by the way, is it worth [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6508.5199999999995s)]
*  Going through to see [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6510.76s)]
*  The other side to see what it looks like this gives you a little flavor of what it was like in there before [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6512.76s)]
*  Yes, the market [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6519.56s)]
*  Was much more busy inside [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6521.56s)]

*  every single [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6536.6s)]
*  Thing that israel is built here is completely illegal. It's not just the settlements, by the way [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6539.4800000000005s)]
*  they still they build settlements and then they build military outposts on top of the settlements as you can see from the [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6545.400000000001s)]
*  designation of square versus circle [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6550.76s)]
*  And then they build roads and then they build walls. They basically partition off the green areas [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6553.4800000000005s)]
*  Or the light green areas where there is full palestinian civil control but joint israeli palestinian security control [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6561.56s)]
*  the full green areas [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6567.0s)]
*  Differ also in terms of full palestinian civil and security control because the full palestinian civil and security control in these [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6569.0s)]
*  Green areas like in the place like hebron also are conducted by the palestinian authority [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6577.4800000000005s)]
*  Or and I don't know if I think hebron as well, but a lot of these places are [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6582.52s)]
*  a lot of these places [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6587.320000000001s)]
*  with the exception of like janine and tolkatam are [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6589.240000000001s)]
*  Almost completely controlled by the palestinian authority, which is an arm of the israeli security apparatus [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6592.76s)]
*  uh tolkatam, uh and janine have their own [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6598.44s)]
*  palestinian [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6602.179999999999s)]
*  Militaries, they're they're spontaneous militias which israel routinely fucking fights back against and by that [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6603.88s)]
*  I mean like they unjustifiably and illegally go into these cities [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6610.84s)]
*  and blow them up [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6615.0s)]
*  and kill as many people as they possibly can [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6617.08s)]
*  Because they have [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6620.68s)]
*  uh their own [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6622.68s)]
*  their own standing militia forces according to the oslo accords area a is pa security control law area b is pa and idf and [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6624.76s)]
*  Area c is only idf hebron is split into h1 and h2 also all of these areas are just completely controlled by israel by the way [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6632.76s)]
*  The different areas of differences in whether pna or iof manage security and whether people are under palestinian or military law [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6641.400000000001s)]
*  But either way, it's all different flavors of israel with the only difference being who oppresses you harder exactly [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6647.48s)]
*  Hebron is under pa authority in area a where he's standing in the dog right now is the line into h2 [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6652.36s)]
*  And that becomes the israeli settlement very weird area to live in how are people supposed to live like this is inhumane. Yeah [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6658.04s)]

*  The palestinian authority for example in areas like janine and tulkarim where there are spontaneous palestinian militias [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6686.12s)]
*  Okay [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6692.679999999999s)]

*  They will go kidnap arrest and torture [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6716.44s)]
*  At the behest of israel they will also routinely again arrest palestinians as a whole they will arrest palestinians that they [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6720.84s)]

*  There's a reason why the palestinian authority is the second [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6734.92s)]
*  Least popular entity in the region [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6739.719999999999s)]
*  the number one least popular entity in the region, of course is the israeli occupying force israel in general, but [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6742.599999999999s)]
*  the second [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6750.2s)]
*  least popular [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6751.719999999999s)]
*  Entity in the area is the palestinian authority is a close parallel [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6753.24s)]
*  Uh, sorry not close parallel. Sorry is a close second to how unfavorable [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6757.639999999999s)]
*  Israel is in the eyes of the palestinian population [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6762.84s)]
*  This is part of the reason why the palestinians in the west bank actually [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6766.679999999999s)]
*  show [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6770.92s)]
*  Uh more favor to hamas than they do the palestinian authority [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6772.28s)]
*  They actually are they actually have a more positive outlook of hamas palestinians in the west bank [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6777.32s)]
*  Have a more positive outlook on hamas [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6782.92s)]
*  Then the palestinians in gaza do [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6785.88s)]
*  Part of the reason for why they have this attitude is because they don't live under hamas control. They don't know [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6789.88s)]
*  Exactly what? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6796.04s)]
*  Complications that might arise from that it's closed completely restricted in order to get back in [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6797.719999999999s)]
*  We can't go through there now because they've closed it's closed. So how do we get back in? [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6803.5599999999995s)]
*  You try from another checkpoint [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6808.44s)]
*  Through here yes [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6815.4s)]
*  This is part of the reason why I think this is really important for a lot of you guys here in the western world to watch and [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6821.88s)]
*  Understand because many people are just not equipped. They don't know what the truth is. They've never seen it [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6827.54s)]
*  They don't understand it and it kind of like when I guy only talks about israel palestine buddy. There's other things going on [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6833.32s)]
*  there are [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6840.76s)]
*  You can go watch the other things that are going on then [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6842.36s)]
*  I mean, I just chose to watch this documentary from one of my favorite documentarians [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6845.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know why that's why that pisses you off so much [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6850.44s)]
*  Well, I do know why that pisses you off so much for many americans when I talk about this kind of stuff by looking at [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6853.48s)]
*  like betselam reports [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6859.32s)]
*  You don't fully understand how fucked up this stuff is right? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6861.5599999999995s)]
*  When you see it though, you develop a a different attitude you start to kind of recognize why I say [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6866.28s)]
*  That a two-state solution is impossible [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6873.88s)]
*  Because this is the two-state solution. It's actually not a real two-state solution. This is a one-state solution [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6877.32s)]
*  That one state is the israeli state. That's why I say abolish the apartheid [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6885.08s)]
*  Okay, and the occupation abolished the apartheid the pathway towards that might [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6891.24s)]
*  uh [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6896.28s)]
*  Might create like a binational, uh two-state [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6897.639999999999s)]
*  Uh with with two separate leaderships that with that would inevitably merge into one state or whatever the fuck [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6901.56s)]
*  But ultimately this is the reason why I say [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6908.2s)]
*  That there can never really be a full-blown two-state solution. This is also precisely. Yes, you're right [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6912.04s)]
*  This is also precisely why tanahesai codes who had previously written favorably about israel [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6917.64s)]
*  Without ever actually visiting or without ever actually understanding the the depravity of israel [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6923.24s)]

*  As soon as he landed in the west bank and laid eyes [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6933.72s)]
*  upon [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6937.4800000000005s)]
*  The apartheid in all of its depravity. He was like, oh, this is it. This is it [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6938.4400000000005s)]
*  That's what's going on [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6944.280000000001s)]
*  Like I know exactly what this is. I read about this in history books [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=6945.72s)]

*  Uh that they've shot to to showcase how the rapture would happen [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7903.24s)]
*  But yeah, if you're wondering why like some of the most anti-semitic people that you've ever encountered are also insanely pro israel. This is why [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7907.5599999999995s)]
*  You're in israel now are we yeah in the west bank no [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7916.759999999999s)]
*  In the north of the west bank I was heading back to the settlement of eviatar [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7926.28s)]
*  Where i'd been hosted by malpial the horse wrangler [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7930.759999999999s)]
*  I [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7933.56s)]
*  Since my visit i'd learned a little more about the settlement's relations with its neighboring palestinian town of beta [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7936.360000000001s)]
*  How beta had been subject to settler attacks and how it in turn had organized regular protests of the settlement [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7944.84s)]
*  Demonstrators had been killed and others wounded during the clashes [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7953.54s)]
*  One of the deaths of a turkish-american volunteer ishanor eski eggy made headlines [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7957.34s)]
*  America's still looking into it by the way [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7968.38s)]
*  Now the settlement was holding a festival to celebrate its recent recognition by the israeli state [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7972.22s)]
*  It [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7977.44s)]
*  Entertainments had been laid on and families from settlements from around the west bank had converged for a day of music and activities [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7981.98s)]
*  One of those speaking was daniela hot cup I remember me me me my heart I just would [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=7993.2s)]
*  Foreign [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8000.48s)]
*  foreign [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8022.88s)]
*  How are you? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8030.24s)]
*  It's a bit quieter. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8033.24s)]
*  As the festivities wound down, I had a moment to speak to Daniela on a hilltop overlooking [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8035.24s)]
*  the Palestinian town of Beita. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8042.24s)]
*  So you've been talking about settling, you've talked about displacing, wanting the Palestinians [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8046.08s)]
*  to go. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8050.0199999999995s)]
*  You said to Africa, to Canada, to England, you don't care where. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8051.0199999999995s)]
*  What would be wrong with either a two-state solution or a one-state solution where everyone [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8055.28s)]
*  had the same rights? [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8058.86s)]
*  We want to have a Jewish state based on Jewish rules, on Jewish values. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8061.78s)]
*  It's not a relationship of neighbours. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8069.259999999999s)]
*  Why not? [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8071.0599999999995s)]
*  Because we are two different nations. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8072.0599999999995s)]
*  Different. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8074.82s)]
*  I just wonder whether you feel or you're aware that, you know, they're really suffering and [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8076.5s)]
*  there's been settlers rampaging through the area of the West Bank. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8083.099999999999s)]
*  So there's all this... [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8087.62s)]
*  Agitation. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8089.62s)]
*  Death. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8090.62s)]
*  Tragedy, right? [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8091.62s)]
*  When a people is invaded, right, and then put under a military occupation, deprived [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8094.22s)]
*  of their rights, that anger seems to be an understandable response, an appropriate response. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8100.42s)]
*  There is no such thing as settler violence. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8107.26s)]
*  Did I speak... [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8109.62s)]
*  I don't know if I... [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8111.22s)]
*  She got the update. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8116.06s)]
*  She got the updated talking points. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8117.780000000001s)]
*  No such thing. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8119.5s)]
*  I don't mind saying it again. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8121.700000000001s)]
*  And I don't mind... [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8123.780000000001s)]
*  I will be glad to explain it. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8125.26s)]
*  You don't believe it's real? [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8126.9400000000005s)]
*  There are videos. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8128.1s)]
*  You can see them. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8129.1s)]
*  You see what? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8130.1s)]
*  Okay. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8131.1s)]
*  Let's say... [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8132.1s)]
*  Now, we have a camera right here. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8133.1s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8135.22s)]
*  And I do this. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8136.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8137.22s)]
*  Do something. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8138.22s)]
*  You don't mind what I did to you. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8139.22s)]
*  You don't necessarily have to do it. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8142.22s)]
*  I won't do that to you. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8143.9800000000005s)]
*  You won't? [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8144.9800000000005s)]
*  And then the camera takes just part. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8146.9s)]
*  You don't have the full picture. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8151.86s)]
*  I think this is literally a perfect demonstration of everything she believes. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8154.0599999999995s)]
*  Out of nowhere, she just has a violent outburst and attacks him for no reason. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8160.62s)]
*  And then that's the only thing that's shown on camera. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8167.219999999999s)]
*  That is exactly how this works. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8170.28s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8173.58s)]
*  He's just standing there. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8174.7s)]
*  She attacks him for no fucking reason and then turns around and goes, oh, the camera [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8176.98s)]
*  only shows one side. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8182.139999999999s)]
*  This is fucked up. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8184.26s)]
*  So yeah, no, this was a perfect demonstration of what actually happens and how she failed, [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8185.62s)]
*  how she failed to make this point that she was trying to get across, which is that initially, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8192.86s)]
*  which is to say that like Palestinians are just living their lives are actually provoking [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8202.18s)]
*  the settlers. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8207.300000000001s)]
*  They're not. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8208.54s)]
*  Then I say you're violent. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8210.98s)]
*  You're violent against a woman. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8213.06s)]
*  This is exactly what is going on all the time with what you call settler violence. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8215.5s)]
*  Settlers do not wake up in the morning or do not go wait for sundown. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8225.220000000001s)]
*  To attack. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8232.38s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8233.38s)]
*  Why should we wake up in the morning and think about violence? [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8234.699999999999s)]
*  Why our life is good? [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8239.779999999999s)]
*  Because you want the Palestinians to leave. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8242.02s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8244.3s)]
*  You've said so. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8246.74s)]
*  I said that what is on my mind all the time is how to bring more people to settle the [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8247.74s)]
*  land. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8256.3s)]
*  This is a new development by Jews. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8257.64s)]
*  This is Ha-bra-ha. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8261.66s)]
*  This is Itzha. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8263.66s)]
*  Here we can develop. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8265.78s)]
*  Here we cannot develop. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8266.78s)]
*  I never think in terms of, I know this is beta. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8269.1s)]
*  I don't think about beta. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8274.02s)]
*  Why not? [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8276.38s)]
*  Because I think about the people. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8278.06s)]
*  I'm a settler. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8279.539999999999s)]
*  The people. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8280.539999999999s)]
*  I'm a human being. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8281.539999999999s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8282.539999999999s)]
*  So are they. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8283.539999999999s)]
*  So I do not think about this. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8284.539999999999s)]
*  You're thinking about tribalism, thinking of your own people to the exclusion. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8287.46s)]
*  It would be understandable to think of your own people or your own children first, but [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8291.06s)]
*  to think about other people, other children, not at all, that seems sociopathic. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8294.699999999999s)]
*  I can... [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8302.26s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8303.26s)]
*  No, not at all. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8304.26s)]
*  This is normal. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8305.26s)]
*  To my children, I give everything because the normal thing for me is to pray for my [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8307.26s)]
*  own people. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8315.34s)]
*  That's it. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8316.699999999999s)]
*  Well now I continue. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8318.78s)]
*  I hope you push me back. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8322.5s)]
*  And so I said goodbye to Daniela and her extreme... [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8333.060000000001s)]
*  Someone gave her a good talking to. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8336.86s)]
*  She was sounding too unhinged in Western media interviews. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8337.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but she's gonna... [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8340.380000000001s)]
*  The funniest thing is like, she's gonna turn around. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8342.300000000001s)]
*  And immediately start chirping again in front of cameras again, as long as she's in front [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8346.94s)]
*  of a bunch of rabid settlers. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8353.1s)]
*  Bro, they want to murder Louie Thoreau so bad right now. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8355.1s)]
*  Yeah, I hope you push me back. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8358.3s)]
*  I hope you push me back. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8360.82s)]
*  Dude, in my mind, it's like kind of crazy to see grandmas get this evil. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8364.82s)]
*  Maybe it's fucked up of me, but when I see grandmas, I don't think that they are capable [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8373.619999999999s)]
*  of being this evil. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8378.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8379.1s)]
*  Gold on my hair? [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8380.1s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8381.1s)]
*  I'm just saying, like... [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXl2m5XW7l8&t=8382.1s)]
