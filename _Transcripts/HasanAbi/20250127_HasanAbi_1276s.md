# Hasan Conquers Japan - Day 4 | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M)
*  Me, Caroline and Will have known each other for a decade plus in the real world and March and Austin are a part of, you know, our cooperative fear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=0.0s)]
*  And obviously, so I think that there's like less weird random drama on our side of the world. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm just lucky that it's not on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  All I'm saying is I'm happy that it is not. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=23.799999999999997s)]
*  Okay, it's January 27th, 12, 22 PM where you're at. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=33.0s)]
*  But where I'm at, it's 5, 22 PM. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=38.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=42.2s)]
*  I'm in Japan. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=43.0s)]
*  It's 5, 22. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=43.8s)]
*  And it's actually the next day. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=45.8s)]
*  It's technically, technically here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=47.8s)]
*  It's not Monday, but it's Tuesday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  I believe fear and is already out. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=52.6s)]
*  And this is the part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=54.6s)]
*  For those of you who don't know yesterday, I had to end the broadcast early. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=58.6s)]
*  And by that, I mean, I didn't actually do a, I didn't actually end the broadcast at all. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=62.6s)]
*  The broadcast ended because the bag pooped. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=67.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's 5 AM here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=70.6s)]
*  Hope you guys enjoyed the fear. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=72.6s)]
*  An episode. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=74.6s)]
*  It's out already with Connor dog, Virginia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=75.6s)]
*  Yesterday, we went to do one piece gym. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=79.6s)]
*  Yesterday, we went to the one piece gym and we were able to stream most of it, but not entirely. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=81.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=90.6s)]
*  What does this Japan stream with a public infogrames impossible? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=91.6s)]
*  Anyway, they went to a magic show and had hot gin. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=94.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=97.6s)]
*  So my, my stream, my stream got cooked. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=98.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=102.6s)]
*  I'll just say it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=103.6s)]
*  My stream got cooked. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=104.6s)]
*  And because my bag just pooped, we swapped it over to Will's. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=105.6s)]
*  We finished the one piece gym after that, after the one piece, which was a little bit underwhelming. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=110.6s)]
*  I will admit I had definitely higher expectations for it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=118.6s)]
*  Like it's just like a very clean gym. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=122.6s)]
*  It's a very nice gym, but it wasn't like, I don't know. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=124.6s)]
*  I just felt like I was there and I was kind of forcing my friends to go and like do something that they were not interested in. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=128.6s)]
*  It felt a little lame. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=136.6s)]
*  It felt a little lame. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=138.6s)]
*  Like it's like a very bland, very normal, very clean gym. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=139.6s)]
*  It's a very nice gym. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=143.6s)]
*  And I didn't realize that like going there with people who just don't really with one piece or know what that is was going to feel the way it did. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=144.6s)]
*  I liked it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=153.6s)]
*  Stock market closed in 35 minutes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=154.6s)]
*  Watch Nvidia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=156.6s)]
*  Yeah. I saw. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=157.6s)]
*  I saw Nvidia's crashing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=158.6s)]
*  The Chinese resurgence, the China, China is coming after us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=160.6s)]
*  China is destroying America. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=165.6s)]
*  Is this, is this why you couldn't take this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=167.6s)]
*  Oh, afterwards, afterwards, we went to the magic bar to auto auto magic bar. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=170.6s)]
*  Oh, and that was incredible. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=178.6s)]
*  That was an incredible experience on Caroline stream. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=180.6s)]
*  They came over while we were eating. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=185.6s)]
*  Gyu Katsu, Gyu Katsu is a Kyoto style. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=189.6s)]
*  Katsu. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=194.6s)]
*  I ate a lot. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=195.6s)]
*  I had a lot of that steak, Katsu beef, Katsu Wagyu Katsu. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=196.6s)]
*  And then after that, we just went to like some random shopping places like like little shopping pop ups or whatever. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=201.6s)]
*  And then after that, we went to this magic bar. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=209.6s)]
*  And then after the magic bar, we went to dinner. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=212.6s)]
*  And after dinner, I fell asleep. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=215.6s)]

*  Okay. All jokes aside. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=222.6s)]
*  God damn it. What the fuck is this? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=224.6s)]
*  This when I literally pay for everything all the time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=226.6s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=230.6s)]

*  Okay, apparently, his son came for dollars. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=399.6s)]
*  Oh. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=404.6s)]

*  It's not time. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=414.6s)]
*  His son picks up a bill. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=415.6s)]
*  So kind of surprised he didn't get the call. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=416.6s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=425.6s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=426.6s)]
*  I'm losing my mind. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=427.6s)]
*  Yo, I feel like half their content is just slander. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=429.6s)]
*  Like they are just sitting around and just slandering us, bro. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=435.6s)]
*  They said, I asked this to Caroline. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=441.6s)]
*  I was like, I said, Caroline, why is everything a feminist battle with you? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=443.6s)]
*  Last night, she, I caught her. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=449.6s)]
*  I caught her lying. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=452.6s)]
*  I turned. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=453.6s)]

*  Okay. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=456.6s)]
*  I turned her stream on and it wasn't even Caroline. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=457.6s)]
*  Ray was lying too. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=461.6s)]
*  I turned their stream on yesterday to see if they were all right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=463.6s)]
*  Like if they hadn't been able to figure out where to go, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=468.6s)]
*  To be more accommodating while I'm eating my delicious. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=471.6s)]

*  Where is so humble. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=483.6s)]
*  She walks around sub celebrities like you guys and treats you as friends. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=484.6s)]
*  Sub celebrities. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=488.6s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=490.6s)]
*  I mean, you ain't wrong. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=491.6s)]

*  You know, one told you that was going to be this worry. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=501.6s)]
*  Why did you send me this link? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=506.6s)]
*  Anyway, listen to me, Hassan. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=508.6s)]
*  After the summer, I stream later. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=510.6s)]
*  Hell yeah, baby. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=511.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=512.6s)]
*  I checked there. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=513.6s)]
*  I checked their stream and it turns out Caroline, I was like, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=516.6s)]
*  Caroline and Ray, both were just lie claiming, claiming that I had not actually sent them [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=521.6s)]
*  the address. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=528.6s)]
*  When not only did I send the name of the restaurant, I sent the fucking address literally instantly [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=529.6s)]
*  reimburse gate after shit. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=536.6s)]
*  Campus card decline never pays for anything. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=537.6s)]
*  Aaron now. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=539.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=540.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=541.6s)]
*  That's the funniest part is that like, luckily this side of the internet that we're on is [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=542.6s)]
*  like very cozy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=547.1s)]
*  Like our little corner of Twitch is very cozy and very nice and not very clicky and not [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=548.6s)]
*  very predisposed to drama. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=555.6s)]
*  You know, and therefore we're never really like on LSF like that because back in the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=557.6s)]
*  day, back in the day, all of these like moments would be clipped on LSF and people would be [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=565.6s)]
*  talking about how shitty like everyone is or whatever. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=571.6s)]
*  Sure, buddy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=575.6s)]
*  You do realize that like most of the people there either started working with one another [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=576.6s)]
*  or have just known each other for a decade almost like like Ray comes from a much, a [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=582.6s)]
*  much nicer part of Twitch and a much nicer part of the internet. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=595.6s)]
*  And will have known each other for a decade plus in the real world and March and Austin [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=601.6s)]
*  are a part of, you know, our cooperative fear and obviously. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=611.6s)]
*  So I think that there's like less weird random drama on our side of the world. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=615.6s)]
*  I'm just lucky that it's not on. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=621.6s)]
*  All I'm saying is I'm happy that it is not. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=624.6s)]
*  It doesn't get clipped on LSF where like random people can, you know, ruin people's lives [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=628.6s)]
*  or ruin the dynamic. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=634.6s)]
*  I was just saying it's very cozy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=636.6s)]
*  Maybe the kids are going to be all right. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=647.6s)]
*  What is this? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=648.6s)]
*  Why are you spoiling? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=649.6s)]
*  I'll look at this later. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=650.6s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=651.6s)]
*  So yeah, what is this? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cUtutbe6M&t=652.6s)]
