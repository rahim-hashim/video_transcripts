# This Was The WORST First Amendment Violation By Democrats | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8)
*  Assan isn't anti-Semitic anyone who thinks otherwise a dumb baby head. No, they're just like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=0.0s)]
*  motivated. They're motivated into believing that because that makes it much easier for them to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=4.72s)]
*  feel like they're actually the correct, they're arriving at the correct way to defend the pro [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=9.52s)]
*  Palestinian position or rather that it exposes their internal contradictions and they don't like that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=15.52s)]
*  Let's take a look at this. Good news. Felony charged against the University of Michigan [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=23.52s)]
*  pro-Palestinian protesters have been dismissed. This of course comes after the FBI in coordination [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  with Dana Nestle, okay, with Democrat attorney general Dana Nestle in a state run by Democrat [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=38.96s)]
*  governor in a state run by the Democratic governor who is now, you know, big Gretch, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=49.12s)]
*  who is now a Trump ally seemingly who keeps finding herself accidentally alongside Donald [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Trump issued a raid in coordination with the FBI on American citizens. Okay. On American citizens, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=62.0s)]
*  what Israel and America are starving Gaza. Wow. Asad is bad. That guy's a joke. I mean, he's, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=72.56s)]
*  he's trying to, to expose the hypocrisy. That's all he's doing when he talks about that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=77.36s)]
*  Anyway, Michigan judge dismisses felony charges against pro-Palestinian student protests after [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=86.0s)]
*  attorney general Nestle's controversial intervention. A Washington County judge has dismissed all [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=91.12s)]
*  charged against seven university Michigan students arrested during a pro-Palestinian encampment last [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=97.6s)]
*  spring closing a months long legal battle sparked by the state attorney general's controversial [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=102.0s)]
*  decision to pursue felonies after local prosecutors declined. Remember local prosecutors [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=106.96s)]
*  were like, these are student protesters. What the are you doing? We are not going to pursue felony [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=112.32s)]
*  charge against student protesters that are protesting against Israel. Are you out of your [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  goddamn mind? Well, attorney general Dana Nestle said, no, we are going to do that. Remember, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=120.16s)]
*  remember when she said that she was going to do that. These are Americans, by the way, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=127.36s)]
*  these are American citizens who were student protesters. That's why they couldn't detain them [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  with an immigration enforcement action in the way that Donald Trump has done so far. Donald Trump [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  State Department has done so far. Remember a severe escalation of civil liberties, a severe [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  escalation of civil liberties in this country, a severe violation of the first amendment [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=150.08s)]
*  conducted by a blue attorney general under the leadership of the democratic party at the time [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=155.44s)]
*  with a democratic governor. And Rashida Tlaib was right to call this out and said, why this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=162.8s)]
*  double standard? Why this double standard for student protesters? We've never done this for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=169.44s)]
*  Black Lives Matter protesters. We've never done this for any protesters at all. Why this double [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  standard? And what did Dana Nestle go and do? Dana Nestle turned around and said, wow, Rashida [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  Tlaib, you're being quite anti-Semitic. After all, I'm Jewish. How dare you imply that there is a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  double standard here. Rashida Tlaib was right and was vindicated time and time again, as she will [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=190.96s)]
*  continue to be vindicated time and time again. Dana Nestle turned around and implied that Rashida [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=196.16s)]
*  Tlaib was anti-Semitic for calling out this hypocrisy, this double standard. Dana Bash, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  also known as Dana Fash on CNN, alongside Jake Tapper, also known as Jake Yapper, turned around [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=208.16s)]
*  and also attacked Rashida Tlaib. They had to retract some of those statements for the record. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes. Dana Nestle is the one who dismissed those charges. Just wait. Okay. Wait for the whole story. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  I know you're spoiling it. I'm I know what happened. It wasn't the county judge. There [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=227.44s)]
*  drops like got it wrong. Okay. Just wait. I'm going to get to it. Hold on. The reason why [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=231.12s)]
*  she did this, the reason why she did this, aside from smearing Rashida Tlaib and calling her an [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=238.24s)]
*  anti-Semite, which is something that I think many people in this community are very familiar with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=243.52s)]
*  whenever someone, especially a Muslim person, oh, God forbid a Muslim person says, Hey, what the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=247.04s)]
*  **** are you doing? Okay. All of a sudden it's like, Oh, because I'm Jewish. Is that what it is? Oh, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=252.72s)]
*  I'll do what? Dual loyalty drops. Is that what you're doing? It's like, no, you're the one who's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=258.64s)]
*  behaving in a ****ing insane manner. This doesn't make any sense. All seven pleaded not guilty and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=263.52s)]
*  were represented by a team of Dearborn based attorneys working for free who cited deep concern [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  over civil liberties and the state's criminalization of student dissent. Attorney General Nestle had [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=272.4s)]
*  initially pursued, pushed the charges. The felony charges were filed by Michigan attorney general [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=276.88s)]
*  Dana Neslov to the local Washtah County prosecutor's office refused to bring them. Nestle [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=280.4s)]
*  reportedly intervened at the request of university of Michigan regents, sparking backlash from civil [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=284.8s)]
*  rights groups and elected officials who questioned the political motivations behind the prosecution. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=289.2s)]
*  Assan isn't anti-Semitic. Anyone who thinks otherwise a dumb baby head. No, they're just like [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=293.36s)]
*  motivated. They're motivated into believing that because that makes it much easier for them to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=298.0s)]
*  feel like they're actually the correct, they're arriving at the correct way to defend the pro [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=302.88s)]
*  Palestinian position or rather that it exposes their, their internal contradictions. And they [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=308.88s)]
*  don't like that. Yeah. But two things can be true at once. Yes. I know two things can be true at [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  once, except this is, you know, Oh, they can be dumb and also motivated. Yes. You're right. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=321.44s)]
*  All charges have been dropped on Monday. Nestle's office moved to dismiss the remaining charges, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=329.84s)]
*  both felony and misdemeanor effectively closing the case. Civil liberties groups say the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=333.52s)]
*  case should have never been brought felony charges against the seven university of Michigan pro [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=337.52s)]
*  Palestinian protests were dismissed by Michigan attorney general Dana Nestle, not by a judge. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  Nestle's office moved to dismiss the charges. Nestle said she stands by her original decision [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=345.76s)]
*  to prosecute claiming a reasonable jury could have found the students guilty, but she concluded [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=349.44s)]
*  that continuing the case was no longer a prudent use of my department's resources. The reason why [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=352.88s)]
*  they did this, by the way, the reason why they did this against American citizens who were student [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=357.12s)]
*  protesters at the university of Michigan. Okay. The reason why they did this was to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=363.04s)]
*  engage in a chilling effect on speech. That is precisely the reason why they did this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=369.36s)]
*  It was never prudent. It was bullshit. And it was a great misuse of funds. But not only was it a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=373.6s)]
*  great misuse of funds, it was a severe escalation. It was a severe escalation that erroneously, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=379.04s)]
*  and perhaps in the most, I mean, it was the most severe violation of the first amendment [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=389.36s)]
*  in the United States of America being conducted by a Democrat attorney general in a, in a state [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=396.24s)]
*  that's run by a Democrat governor. And it started under the Biden administration. Look, here's my [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=401.6s)]
*  coverage from September. Yeah, Jay Tapper is sloppy in the way that he tries to propagandize [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=407.84s)]
*  these positions. He has notoriously been a major enemy to the likes of Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  far before October 7. He is one of the most biased and one of the biggest Islamophobic [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=420.96s)]
*  assholes. Here's the investigative reporter from Detroit Metro Times. Here's the full remarks from [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  the Detroit Metro Times, by the way, the article. This is a move that's going to set a precedent, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=433.2s)]
*  and it's unfortunate that a Democrat made that move, Tlaib said. You would expect that from a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=436.96s)]
*  Republican, but not from a Democrat, and that's really unfortunate. It was very inclusive. It was [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=440.96s)]
*  diverse, very loving, Tlaib, Detroit Democrat says. When I visited, I remember they were talking [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  about the Armenian genocide and what we learned from that. It was very powerful. I wish University [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=450.56s)]
*  of Michigan president Santa Ono could see his students as people that just want to save lives, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=454.0s)]
*  no matter their faith or ethnicity. We've had the right to dissent, the right to protest, Tlaib says. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  We've done it for climate, the immigrant rights movement, for Black lives, and even around the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=464.32s)]
*  issues of injustice among water shutoffs. But it seems that the attorney general has decided if the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=468.4s)]
*  issue was Palestine, she was going to treat it differently. And that alone speaks volumes about [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  possible biases within the agency she runs. Rashida Tlaib made no mention of Attorney General Nessel's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=476.64s)]
*  Jewish heritage. She suggested that there were possible biases against pro-Palestinian voices in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=481.84s)]
*  her office based on her decision to charge the protesters. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=486.4s)]
*  leveled the same false claims against Rashida Tlaib, accused her of being anti-Semitic. This was [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=491.52s)]
*  three days ago. Rashida's religion should not be used in a cartoon to imply that she's a t***, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  is Islamophobic and wrong, just as Rashida should not use my religion to imply I cannot perform my [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  job fairly as Attorney General. It is anti-Semitic and wrong. Jake Tapper has done this so many f***ing [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=502.96s)]
*  times when it comes to Black and Brown congresspersons, but specifically Muslim congressperson. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  He always gets away with it because Islamophobia is normalized in American society, in especially [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=514.56s)]
*  the post-9-11 universe. That is precisely the reason why he can say whatever the f*** he wants [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=520.8s)]
*  about racism. Yep. Straight up. Straight up. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chrqdbq8M8&t=525.5999999999999s)]
