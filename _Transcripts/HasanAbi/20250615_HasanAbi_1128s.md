*  How is that possible and now and now you can't find him like what is happening? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=160.7s)]
*  the amount of information we have on this dude is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=165.82s)]
*  Far far far more vast than Luigi Mangione. Nobody knew his name. Nobody knew nothing about Luigi Mangione and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=169.38s)]
*  They were able to very quickly figure out who he was where he was allegedly how he [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=176.5s)]
*  Did the UHC healthcare CEO allegedly once again, we don't even know if it was actually him who did it [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=183.58s)]

*  Was appointed to a political position by Tim Walz. There's no way there is nothing confusing about this guy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  This is only confusing to you if you're a moron [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  Right-wingers get appointed especially if they got a previous position from the previous government [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=210.8s)]
*  Right-wingers get appointed to like small business bureau style positions all the time by Democrats [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=217.23999999999998s)]

*  So now he's attacking Democrats [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  So you have to try to figure out where he is with a lot of confusing different messages [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=228.28s)]
*  It's a very confusing motive because this guy [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=235.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a confusing moment if you're a baboon, dude [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=238.92s)]
*  This is roommate by the way [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=247.04s)]
*  There are still MAGA insisting Vance Belter was a Democrat when the people who knew him most have confirmed [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=249.84s)]
*  He was a Trump super fan listen to his roommate reading a text for him [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  This is the same roommate who confirmed he was a Trump supporter [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=256.44s)]
*  I don't want to say anything more and implicate you in any way [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=258.44s)]
*  because you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=264.08s)]

*  Has a hit list of all the top state Dems and abortion providers [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=335.92s)]
*  But something about Marxist not releasing the manifest of the media has provided a vacuum that even senators are using the relentlessly vomit out obvious [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=339.04s)]

*  My mega friend texted me last night. The left is going crazy in their own politicians [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=381.52s)]
*  There have been a lot of straws, but this one is actually the last straw is too dumb [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=384.9s)]
*  Just spoke with here's Lillia Luciano national course book with Vance Belter's roommate David who told us he was very conservative and would [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=389.36s)]
*  Be offended if people thought he was a Democrat as some had assumed [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=396.12s)]
*  That he was a fan of info wars that he voted for and was very happy president from won the election [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=398.6s)]
*  He added that Belter had been struggling finding work since returning from DRC several months ago that he didn't like abortion [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  But had not discussed the issue much lately [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=409.04s)]
*  He said he was a born-again Christian and it changed significantly since that at some point [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=410.8s)]
*  He was preaching from a tent in a park [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=415.6s)]
*  There it is born again Christian to that makes a lot of sense [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=417.36s)]
*  David told us he saw Belter on security camera returned to the property after the shooting and saw him pacing back and forth in the video [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=421.44s)]
*  He received a text from Belter which read in part the friend he texted saying David and Ron. I love you guys [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  I've made some choices and you guys don't know anything about this, but I'm gonna be gone for a while [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=432.62s)]
*  I may be shortly [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=435.98s)]
*  So I just want to let you know that I love you guys both and I wish it had gone this way [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=436.94s)]
*  I wish it hadn't gone this way [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=440.9s)]
*  I don't want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don't know anything about this [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=442.98s)]
*  But I love you guys and I'm sorry for all the trouble. This is caused [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=447.62s)]
*  When a public and say he's not one of ours is a damn they're just doing the canard this Sartre speaks of here [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=450.5s)]
*  They're having fun [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=454.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think so for sure [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=456.26s)]
*  Because this doesn't make any sense [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=460.74s)]
*  But I don't think they realize that like that kind of has motion on Twitter [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=462.82s)]
*  Which I think Elon is base boosting by the way [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=466.3s)]
*  I want to point that out because normally I look at this this tweet 71,000 likes this tweet [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=468.66s)]

*  17,000 likes I feel like I feel like there's some some spice in the algo a little bit or they're just juicing this misinformation [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=491.65999999999997s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too conspiratorially minded, but I also can totally see Elon Musk like testing this how much can we? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=499.26s)]

*  Groc wise wise the left so murders [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=524.58s)]
*  They don't seem so tolerant the claim that the left is murders isn't backed by evidence the cited incidents like the United Health [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=526.54s)]
*  Christy or Minnesota lawmakers murder show no clear ties the left wing groups motives were often individual or unclear [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=530.7s)]
*  Croc has been manipulated by leftist indoctrination. Unfortunately, I know working on fixing that this week [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9q2YhYAxQ&t=537.6800000000001s)]
