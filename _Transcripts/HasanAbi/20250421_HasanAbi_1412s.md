# The Brutality Of The IDF Is Unbelievable | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4)
*  Yeah, they dismissed him. He did an internationally recognized, heavily publicized, an act of that is completely and utterly unjustifiable, and yet somehow normal process within the Israeli occupying forces, killing fields in Gaza. And they only just went, oh, all right, well, I guess we'll move you over to desk duty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=0.0s)]
*  Anyway, let's move on from this. Let's get to Israel. On the story of Israel, as you know, the most moral nation on the planet, the most moral nation on the planet, the best democracy on the planet, Israel. Okay. And if you don't say that you're anti semitic and a terrorist, and you should be deplatformed and possibly black bag in the middle of the street and sent off to a concentration camp in El Salvador, where you will slave away for the rest of your life for the crime of not saying this fundamental truth. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=30.0s)]
*  Okay, let me get that out of the way. Israel did a boo boo an accident. They killed a bunch of first responders directly shot them killed them. And then they dug holes a mass grave, an unmarked mass grave, and dumped the bodies of the healthcare workers into that mass grave alongside the ambulance. And at first, when people were like, what the fuck you executed a bunch of healthcare workers, what are you doing? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=60.0s)]
*  They said, Oh, they were Hamas. Then they were like, No, they weren't. They were healthcare workers. They said, Oh, well, their lights were off. So we accidentally thought that they were Hamas. And then footage came out that showed that that wasn't the case. And that the initial suspicion that Israel just executed these people was correct. They turned around and said, Oopsie, I guess we fucked up. And it became an issue of accountability for Israel, even though they should have no respect at this point, because they've never [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=90.4s)]
*  said the truth. This is not the first convoy of ambulances that Israel has fired upon and executed. And it most likely won't be the last if we don't put an end to Israel's violence. But now, accountability has finally come to Israel, it seems. Let's take a look at what they did. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=119.84s)]
*  Professional failure, a series of operational mistakes. These are the findings of the Israeli military's investigation into its attack on a medical convoy in Gaza, the killed 15 Palestinian aid workers. Israeli troops buried their bodies and the crushed vehicles in the sand. The military, under pressure to explain its actions, has released a statement. It says, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=137.82s)]
*  The deputy commander failed to identify the fire truck and ambulances, blaming it on poor night visibility. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=168.18s)]
*  So how did this shitty collab with Ian Pan out everybody? It's so satisfying seeing you fall off. What? You talking about iDubbbz? Fall off? Are you okay? Is this person seeing something that I'm not seeing? What kind of alternative reality do you exist in? Have you fallen off to 35,000 live concurrer viewers? Like, what do you mean? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  Having said that, it's also, yeah, six hours in. So yeah, so buddy, how was being hot and rich working out? So nice to see you fall off. I got shit in my ass from wiping poorly. You had 35k last week too? I did. I don't really know. Yeah, I don't really know what this chatter is talking about. It's weird. But okay, one day it'll happen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=196.56s)]
*  Burgles, thank you for the 50, give the subs contributing to the fallout fund. Thank you. Thank you for your support in this trying time. As I have consistently fallen off over and over again, you know, hate it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=217.48s)]
*  Chat only saw your views on election night and thinks you average 300k. Yeah. If I average 300,000 views every single day, America would be closely resembling Chinese manufacturing at this point. I think. Adrian is online. Thank you for the 25 gift to subs caked up bot. Thank you for the 10 gifted subs. Love seeing you fall. And then you're screaming the 35k people being invited on stage for Coachella going on podcast being interviewed, being hooked, being booked and busy. I mean, yeah, he's just manifesting the fall off and it'll happen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=235.96s)]
*  Eventually. What day this week? Was it again? He'll apparently show. No, not this week. It's going to be next month, but I don't know. This guy has been coming in since 2022 and maybe at a certain point, why'd it might've been a fan and somewhere along the line. I mean, he was like rating ad break. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=266.0s)]
*  Jebates. And then somewhere along the line, his attitude change scum of the earth. Lol. Copium dog. So how did the shitty collab with the impan out for your buddy star fire 57. Thank you for the 10 gifted subs and hitting kitchen. Thank you for the five of the subs. And Adrian is online. Thank you for the 25 gifted subs. I want us on the notice me someday. I notice you sweet baby Ray. Let's continue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=282.92s)]
*  He opened fire. The rest of the battalion followed. He has now been dismissed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=309.84s)]
*  This is it. They dismissed him. He did an internationally recognized, heavily publicized an active that is completely and utterly unjustifiable and yet somehow normal process within the Israeli occupying forces, killing fields in Gaza. And they only just went, oh, all right. Well, I guess we'll move you over to desk duty. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=316.2s)]
*  Statement also said removing the bodies was reasonable under the circumstances, but the decision to crush the vehicles was wrong. And there was no attempt to conceal the event. Oh, dude. Yeah, no, totally. That wasn't that wasn't to conceal the event at all. We were super proud of it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=340.96s)]
*  At the heart of the matter is the idea killed jumpsuit. Israel again claimed that six were members of Hamas, but it has provided no evidence of this. First of all, as the idea said, and we've been gathering the evidence around this from the very beginning and taking our time to do so is that five or possibly six members of the people that were in that ambulance have links to Hamas. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  Sky News own investigation didn't find any proof the medics were associated with Hamas. It was the video found on the phone of one of the medics killed that provided the first real evidence of what happened. It proved the convoy did have its lights on and medics. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=386.96s)]
*  I'm definitely wrong with this. Probably Israel's Abu Ghraib moment. It exposed them so blatantly. Every MSM outlet is against them on this openly. And even New York Times was the one who reported on it. Like Abu Ghraib, very few GIs got a slap on the wrist here. One guy got dismissed. It will be another thing on the scale against Israel's public image. Yeah, but I think it doesn't fucking matter ultimately, because as long as America looks at this depravity and says, no, they're keep doing it, keep pushing it, you know, it will continue. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=406.4s)]
*  America not only defends Israel with propaganda, whenever they engage in acts like this, they refuse to acknowledge these horrifying atrocities, some in the media barely offer it coverage. But ultimately, as long as there is no real pressure from other countries, because they are all captive to American interests, servile to American interests entirely, all the regional actors, with some notable exceptions, which we have all the smoke for like the Houthis, for example, and the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=434.92s)]
*  Houthis are the arch nemesis of America, they're the worst country on the planet. They're the worst. They're so bad. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=464.92s)]
*  We're wearing high vis vests contradicting an earlier statement by the military. Israel story has changed since the bodies were recovered and calls for an independent. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=471.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's broad daylight, they fucking do this every time. And the only reason why they even do this is because it is an act of violence so shocking and so naked, so nakedly inhumane, that it causes a stirrup in the Western world within Western media. And only then are they only then do they at least lie about what took place. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=482.48s)]
*  And then slowly but surely the truth comes out and then they go oopsie. And there's nothing that takes place. This is the Israeli method. In perpetuity. This has never changed. There's like that famous newspaper article from multiple decades ago at this point where it's like, what is it the the narcissists poem or whatever but talking about Israel? Oh, nothing happened. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it or not, if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Hamas. And if it did, it was Ham [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=512.48s)]
*  was their fault if Oh, if it comes out that it was our fault. It's like oops, we made a mistake. With no repercussions whatsoever. No real accountability whatsoever. It's not new. This happened with Shireen Abou Aqlai as well. And it happens [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=542.48s)]
*  thousands of times more than that. It's just these are the ones that actually make its way to the Western world. These are the stories that make its way to the Western world. It is real lies about it. And they don't even suffer any repercussions in the eyes of the media. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=557.84s)]
*  The media will tomorrow turn around and take an Israeli official seriously as though they are not straightforwardly fucking lying to them. They'll go Oh, what happened? Yeah, that didn't happen. And if it did, it wasn't bad. And if it was, that's not a big deal. And if it is, that's not my fault. And if it was, I didn't mean it. And if I did, you deserved it. Westerners that are paying close attention to this stuff, are basically seeing 1% the tip of the fucking iceberg, not even the tip of the iceberg, just 1% of the atrocity. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=572.48s)]
*  And even then, Israel is so obviously fucking lying all the goddamn time about every single minute detail. They're not even doing a good job with their lives. They just like, know that there's no accountability. So they don't even see the need to. And then everyone is shocked why everybody says fuck Israel. I wonder how this happened. Why would anybody say fuck Israel? Fuck this country that's doing shit like this. Yeah, CNN International is really probing to the killing of the 15 [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=602.48s)]
*  thousand emergency workers finds professional failures in the unit, a commander is being fired over the incident. That is not accountability. criminals cannot investigate themselves. But more importantly, the only reason Israel even announced the sham investigation is because of the footage that exposed their [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=632.48s)]
*  lives and attempted cover up just imagine what else they're hiding. We don't even have to imagine it. We cover it on a daily fucking basis. We cover it on a daily basis. It's just mainstream media doesn't choose to cover those stories at all. Because if they did, the percentage of people that have an [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=643.64s)]
*  unfavorable opinion of Israel would go from 53% to 99% because it is a Nazi country doing a live streamed version of the Holocaust. It's that simple. No matter how much no matter how much you think, oh, well, I've been taught that this is a good country. There's only so much child [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=661.2s)]
*  murder that you can you can experience that you can watch happen in broad daylight and still continue your support. You have to have a lifetime of direct social conditioning associated with a real fear, not a valid one, but one that you perceive as valid, that if this country wasn't being violent like this, then you would all die. And even then there are considering that there are plenty of Zionists [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=684.72s)]
*  Jews that become anti Zionists in the process of recognizing these atrocities. Seemingly, even with a lifetime of social conditioning, you can still recognize the truth. There's also the other side of this where obviously, Israel is also facing internal crisis, the Israeli army is facing his biggest [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=714.72s)]
*  refusal crisis in decades. Over 100,000 Israelis have reportedly stopped showing up for reserve duty while the reasons differ the scale demonstrates the war's waning legitimacy. There's only so much death and destruction that the rabid, bloodthirsty assholes will engage with as well. Eventually, they want to go back to wearing capri pants and listening to side trans music and eating shitty hummus. Okay, the benefits of being a part of the Imperial Corps, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=733.58s)]
*  is to do those sorts of things. You're not built for war, you're going to want to dance again, you know, that's what happens. The only thing natives have to do is wait it out with Israel is a little bit different because it's a settler colonial entity that is established over the course of 76 years. But there's only so much militancy that they will withstand. There's only so much violence they can put out there before they go. Oh, well, what's all of this for? Like, I want to give it my shitty marketing job. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=763.58s)]
*  And go back to eating the worst fucking hummus of all time. Listening to the worst side trans music that you have ever heard. I want to be able to continue to torture myself with this kind of shit. Doubling down on the hummus. Yeah, the most. Yeah, I am the number one anti-Semite. They're calling me a fucking Nazi over there, brother, because of the bleach sword. What is this? They want to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=794.38s)]
*  We're Zionists, of course we recognize the Jewish people's right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland. We're Zionists, of course we support the IDF's mission to dismantle hummus and release the halloween. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=816.78s)]
*  Hummus! [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=825.74s)]
*  We're Zionists, we know Hatikva like the back of our hand. We're Zionists, we Israelify our wardrobe when Israel is attacked to show our support and pride. We're Zionists, of course we proudly stand by our brothers and sisters in the holy land. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=826.74s)]
*  We're Zionists, of course we won't stop talking about our last trip to Israel. We're Zionists, our favorite colors are blue and white. We're Zionists. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=840.7s)]
*  This was so funny. Is this ironic? No, dude, this is literally how bad the propaganda is. So fucking libed up. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=847.7s)]
*  We value life and mourn every innocent death. We're Zionists, we won't stop advocating for the world's only Jewish state. We're Zionists, one of our favorite sayings is three words. I'm Israelify. We're Zionists. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=854.7s)]
*  Careful now saying their hummus's ass is anti-Semitism and denying the Holocaust. So you deny the Holocaust. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=867.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I love Israeli hummus is the best. It's the only real hummus. It's my favorite part of Israeli cuisine. I'm so sorry. Please don't fucking kidnap me and put me in a facility and torture me please. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=874.6600000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. I'm going to keep eating the hummus. I promise. I know you're kidding and referring to Ethan. I'm just riffing with you chatter. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=887.6600000000001s)]
*  Eat the fucking shitty hummus and say you like it. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=897.6600000000001s)]
*  Anyway, here's some, some good news. Senator Pete Welch met with Moshe and Madhawi and this is the conversation that they had. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=900.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm here with our friend from the upper Valley, Moshe. We've been having a nice talk, but I want you to have a chance to explain to people how you're doing to accomplish and how is your thing so positive despite your circumstances. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=909.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you for the visit. It really means a lot and it reassures me. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=925.62s)]
*  Oh my God. I forgot that lady. That was from you and from the Vermonters as well. My people, the people of Vermont. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=931.62s)]
*  I'm saying positive by reassuring myself and the inevitability of justice and the deep belief of democracy. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=941.62s)]
*  This is the reason I wanted to become a citizen of this country because I believe in the principles of this country. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=951.58s)]
*  You told me you were preparing for your citizenship exam that you thought you were going to take when you were detained. One of the questions you were going to answer. Just explain that about rights. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=957.58s)]
*  One of the most important questions, the most important rights is the bill, the bill of rights, which includes free speech on the top of these rights, freedom of assembly, freedom of press, freedom of having religion or not having religion at all. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=969.5400000000001s)]
*  I learned also in this test that I had to study for that the freedom of speech and religion and assembly is guaranteed to everyone in the United States, which is part of the foundation of this country. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=987.5s)]
*  Well, I want you to also, you know, Secretary Ruby, I'll see if you're a threat to foreign policy. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1004.46s)]
*  Can you just tell us what you were hoping for and how you've worked with some of your Jewish brothers and sisters as well as Muslim brothers and sisters? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1010.46s)]
*  My activism, so they are basically he is describing being anti-war as anti-Semitic. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1020.4200000000001s)]
*  How could that be possible when my partners, most of my partners at Columbia's campus and beyond are Jews and Israelis? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1029.42s)]
*  My work has been centered on peacemaking and all what I am doing, I am being a human. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1038.42s)]
*  My empathy, as I mentioned before, extends beyond the Palestinian people and my empathy extends to the Jews and to the Israelis. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1045.38s)]
*  And my hope and my dream is to see this conflict, if one might say, to see an end to the war and end to the killing, to see a peaceful resolution between Palestinians and Israelis. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1055.38s)]
*  How could this be a threat to anybody except the war machine that is feeding this? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1070.3400000000001s)]
*  It would be good for everybody, for us to have peace. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1075.3400000000001s)]
*  I want to tell everyone that I feel so loved and so supported. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1078.3400000000001s)]
*  And I am here in good hands. I am centered. I am clear. I am grounded. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1084.3400000000001s)]
*  And I don't want you to worry about me. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1090.3400000000001s)]
*  I want you to continue working for the democracy of this country and for humanity. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1093.3400000000001s)]
*  The war must stop. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1099.3s)]
*  Thank you so much. I am very grateful. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1101.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1103.3s)]
*  It's kind of wild that they're criminalizing some of the nicest guys in this movement. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1105.3s)]
*  I don't know what the purpose is. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1113.3s)]
*  Is the purpose to put a message out there that no matter how kind you are about, no matter how kind you are, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1117.3s)]
*  we still think that you're, you know, we still think that you shouldn't be in America. Is that what it is? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1125.26s)]
*  I just, I don't get it because like there's definitely, there's definitely a lot of motherfuckers out there that have said, myself included. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1132.26s)]
*  Like I have said way, way, way more aggressive shit than Mosin. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1140.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1147.26s)]
*  Way more aggressive shit than Mosin. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1149.26s)]
*  And I think it's perfectly warranted to say way more aggressive shit than Mosin in this regard. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1152.22s)]
*  So the fact, I mean, obviously I'm an American citizen, so it's different, but like the fact that like they couldn't find someone who was even like a little bit more radical. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1160.22s)]
*  You're a citizen. They're still working out how to get you, brother. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1170.22s)]
*  I know, but the kind of makes them seem like soft targets, easier to get. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1174.22s)]
*  What is this? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1177.22s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that one. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1179.22s)]
*  If you wanted to present the administration as insane monsters, if you wanted to present the administration as like unreasonable and insane monsters, these are, yeah, this is the fucking tweet. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1181.18s)]
*  Fuck Mary kill. I know. I saw. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1196.18s)]
*  These are the types of people. These are the sympathetic figures that you would go after. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1199.18s)]
*  Like it almost feels they have made themselves look horrible. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1203.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1207.18s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1208.18s)]
*  I sent this to my hyper's on his mom and she called me and said she supports Mosin while still supporting Israel. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1210.14s)]
*  Trump is literally losing Israel supporters over this stuff. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1214.14s)]
*  I think so. It dissuades descent and shows that even if you are in a violent cycle about it, they will still remove you from a daily life and family. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1218.14s)]
*  I know, but you're you're losing support from the constituents that would be in the middle here, which is so weird because like I'm thinking if I want here, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1224.14s)]
*  I put my evil fascism hat on right. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1239.1000000000001s)]
*  If I want to kickstart the process of mass deportations and to create a chilling effect on speech, specifically as it pertains to speech on Israel that I consider to be inappropriate. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1242.1000000000001s)]
*  Wrong. Right. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1253.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go after someone that is like maybe painted a red triangle or someone that has said like glory to the martyrs. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1255.1000000000001s)]
*  Like I love Hamas, something like that, because I'm sure there's like a student out there that has done that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1262.1000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? Or someone who had directly played a role in the camp in camp is like, I think that that's still indefensible, by the way, to deport those people. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1268.06s)]
*  But like that's who I would if I was a more competent fascist in charge, that's who I would go after to revoke the citizenship of because you want to have a strong case. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1275.06s)]
*  You want to have the strongest case possible as you're trying to open the door to more and more evil shit. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1287.06s)]
*  Like the very fact that they couldn't find like a single student visa having not green card, a student visa, however, who like put the barricades up or whatever. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1293.02s)]
*  And also was saying Hamas is the best. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1304.02s)]
*  I think Hamas should do whatever it wants to to every Zionist or something along those lines like which again should still be protected under the First Amendment. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1309.02s)]
*  But at least you could present a much a much better argument. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1317.02s)]
*  You could present a much better argument to the broader American consciousness than like the nicest fucking dude of all time. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1321.98s)]
*  Stop giving them tips. I'm just saying it's just it makes no fucking sense. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1330.98s)]
*  A competent fascist and oxymoron? No, like, yes, fascists are stupid. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1334.98s)]
*  But there is a level of stupidity that shocks me as well here. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1340.98s)]
*  You can still be at least I mean, they would normally be like at least some level of competent to push for their agenda. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1345.94s)]
*  He's literally a radical pacifist like he does not believe in the use of violence under any circumstances. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1353.94s)]
*  Yeah. When you rabid, you think anything you get, you can't help yourself. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1357.94s)]
*  Yeah. They want the most impactful organizations. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1361.94s)]
*  They don't care what Americans think. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1364.94s)]
*  They care about violence only ending the progress of the movement. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1365.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1367.94s)]
*  They're literally grabbing people that are the easiest to hurt. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1368.94s)]
*  No, they're grabbing people that they're they're playing fascism on hard mode. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1372.9s)]
*  Like the only harder mode of playing fascism would be grabbing someone like myself who is an American citizen. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1375.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1382.9s)]
*  Like that would be the hardest difficulty. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1384.9s)]
*  And instead of going for like new game plus seven difficulty, they went for new game plus four difficulty. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1386.9s)]
*  You're going after Columbia students with green cards. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1392.9s)]
*  Who are like over the top, far, far more hyper pacifist than I ever could be given those circumstances. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsofKJ18j4&t=1396.9s)]
