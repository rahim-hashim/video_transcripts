# Trump Throws TANTRUM After Iran Claims Victory | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0)
*  tremendous damage would have been sued and many Iranians would have been, it was going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=0.0s)]
*  to be the biggest attack of the war by far during the last few days, I was working on [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=4.12s)]
*  possible removal of sanctions and other things, which would have given a much better chance [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=10.82s)]
*  to Iran at full, fast and complete recovery. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=14.86s)]
*  Yeah. Still waiting on the time and place of his choosing to attack the Trump administration, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=19.42s)]
*  I can't, I can't wait to see what he's got cooked up for Trump, dude. He's lost it. He's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=28.66s)]
*  obviously lost his dang mind. He is angry. He wants his quote big, beautiful spending [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=35.1s)]
*  bill by July 4th. And today will be an important day at the Supreme court as well with a ruling [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=40.9s)]
*  that has major implications for president Trump's agenda nationwide. But we start in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=45.7s)]
*  Iran where some officials there admit the U S military strikes caused serious damage [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=49.58s)]
*  to clear sites. MTS tie up is inside Iran where he's been talking to Iranians about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=54.8s)]
*  their reaction to the attacks by the U S and Israel. It should be noted MTS is movements [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=59.52s)]
*  are and reporting are being followed closely by the Iranian government. MTS good morning. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=63.92s)]
*  What are people telling you? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=69.04s)]
*  Good morning. Well here in Iran, the deadly 12 day war with Israel has triggered a rare [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=71.52s)]
*  surge in national unity amongst Iranians who are so often deeply divided over how their [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  nation is run as the country's supreme leader downplayed any damage caused to its facilities. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=81.72s)]
*  In a taped address, Ayatollah Ali Hamenei lashed out at Israel and the U S saying Iran [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=90.84s)]
*  had quote, delivered a slap to America's face. We met Iranian government spokeswoman Fatima [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=99.24s)]
*  Hajarani here in Tehran. She told us her country would continue to pursue its new program. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  We had no intention to move towards a nuclear bomb. It's Israel that has 19 nuclear warheads, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=114.4s)]
*  but we did not want to go that way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  The only man, the only man who can outdo Hakeem Jeffries in charisma. Ayatollah Hamenei, damn [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  dude, back to back panty droppers on the broadcast. What am I going to do? I know it's hard. It's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=129.8s)]
*  hard to keep up. It's hard to keep up with the, with the news of the day with this many [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=137.8s)]
*  sex icons. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=143.56s)]
*  Nonetheless, we will obtain the scientific knowledge to do what we want with our program. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  Since we arrived in Iran, what struck us is how Iranians from across the political spectrum [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  and who often agree on very little were united against what they saw as unprovoked attacks [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=158.48s)]
*  by Israel and the U S that killed over 600 Iranians. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=165.56s)]
*  What do you mean what they see as? That is what it is. What do you mean what the Iranian [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  people see as unprovoked attacks by Israel and the U S? That's what happened. That's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  so stupid. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=180.6s)]
*  Even those who had open grievances came together to support the Iranian state. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=181.84s)]
*  The official line from Iran's leadership is its program is far from obliterated. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=188.4s)]
*  These facilities have been seriously damaged. Any further reports should come from technical [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=195.0s)]
*  experts in the field. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=199.56s)]
*  So there is a possibility that these sites have been completely destroyed. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=201.72s)]
*  I want to stress that these facilities have been seriously damaged. However, we must wait [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=207.32s)]
*  for the report. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=213.08s)]
*  Now in all of our trips here to Iran, it's clear this is a nation that deeply reveres [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=215.12s)]
*  its nearly 3000 years of history and culture. And it's been explained to us that the Iranian [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=220.0s)]
*  leadership's concept of time may somewhat differ from how we might understand it. Meaning [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=226.2s)]
*  that if Iran's program has indeed been set back by months or even years for them, they [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  seem to believe time is ultimately on their side. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=239.0s)]
*  For CBS mornings, I'm Ifyaz Tayyab in Tehran. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=244.08s)]
*  The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  The Iranian is a mysterious figure who has a different understanding of time and place. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  The Persian concept of time, the same as the Westerner. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=259.6s)]
*  The mind of a Persian is a mystery. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=265.20000000000005s)]
*  Mysterious. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  Mysteriously, they feel galvanized and emboldened and angry and resentful to war. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  On today, Iran's supreme leader spoke for the very first time since the conflict. He [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  is claiming victory over Israel and says the US failed to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  Ifyaz Tayyab and a CBS News crew traveled inside the country to see how this is playing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=286.0s)]
*  out on the ground. It was a revealing journey. Ifyaz joins us from the Iranian capital of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=290.36s)]
*  Tehran. Ifyaz, good morning. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=295.68s)]
*  Good morning. Well, after days of silence, Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=298.96s)]
*  Khamenei, congratulated his country's quote, victory over Israel. But after nearly two [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=303.4s)]
*  weeks of intense fighting, Iran's airspace had been closed. And the only way we could [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=308.7s)]
*  get here was by road. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=313.56s)]
*  We started our journey from the Turkish-Iranian border at night, a nearly 600 mile trip to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  Tehran made longer by checkpoints and bad roads. As day broke, we traveled past vast [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=322.44s)]
*  countryside, arid, rocky and seemingly endless. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=328.96s)]
*  We've already been driving for 10 hours and have another four hours ahead of us. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  The reason we had to drive was because up until that afternoon, Iran's airspace had [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=338.88s)]
*  been complete. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=343.64s)]
*  Open presence to donate 2,800 subs. Is that not odd? I don't ask these sorts of questions, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=344.76s)]
*  but I assume a Euler from cutter or Euler from Euler from Iran, or most likely someone [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  from a country where the currency exchange favors this kind of purchase. I don't know, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=363.56s)]
*  but usually it's like that. It's usually like, like we used to have a Turkish gifter as [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=370.12s)]
*  well who gifted like 5,000 gifted subs. And, and I don't know if they're in America or [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=374.68s)]
*  not, but sometimes people would just like gift from Turkey and they'll give like 5,000 [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  gift to subs. And it's like $5. They didn't switch normalize all sub prices by nation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  So you can't really do it like that anymore. I don't think so. I think there's still a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=390.2s)]
*  currency exchange now open Hamas. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=393.72s)]
*  No, there are a lot of countries whose localized prices are adjusted to be around $2 USD closed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=397.32000000000005s)]
*  Even with the ceasefire in place, we saw fuel still being limited at gas stations. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  As we arrived in Tehran, we found it slowly coming back to life after 12 days of near [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  constant Israeli attacks, which killed at least 600, according to the Iranian government. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=416.68s)]
*  Last week, President Trump urged the entire city, roughly the same population of New York [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=423.72s)]
*  City to evacuate. Most remained. And with the ceasefire appearing to hold, some have [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  started to venture out after those park, a historic meeting spot for Iranian thinkers [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=436.04s)]
*  and writers. A few of the cafes and restaurants had reopened chicken, son, fried chicken [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=442.56s)]
*  sandwich. Oh, there's been a back and forth by the way, because the, the Ayatollah said [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=448.08s)]
*  like he won and then Trump obviously got very mad at that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=454.24s)]
*  Let me see if I can find it. But he basically was like, he wrote this effort post, which [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=458.16s)]
*  I can't be the only one who gets annoyed by this. Like I don't like when Trump writes [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=466.28s)]
*  these long effort posts. I feel like he's trying too hard and it's not like him. You [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=470.02s)]
*  know what I mean? Another hundred, Jesus Christ. Crazy. Like Trump is at his best when [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=475.48s)]
*  he's just like doing short, concise attacks. Piffy, you know, he's undressing for subs [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  confirmed. No. Why would the so-called Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of the war [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  torn country of Iran say so blatantly and foolishly that he won the war with Israel [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=493.44s)]
*  when he knows his statement is a lie. It is not. So as a great, as a man of great faith, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=496.68s)]
*  his country was decimated. He's three evil sites were obliterated. His three, his three [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=503.56s)]
*  evil sites were obliterated. And I knew exactly where he was sheltered. And I would not let [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=510.8s)]
*  Israel or the U S armed forces by far the greatest and most powerful army in the world [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=516.2s)]
*  turn his life. I saved him from a very ugly and ignominious. Okay. He didn't write that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=519.6s)]
*  Trump does not know the word ignominious. No, he did not write this. This is, this is [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=525.76s)]
*  Steven Chung or, cause this, this is not even the golf caddy of Donald Trump that wrote [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=531.56s)]
*  this. Like he did not write that word. And he does not have to say thank you, president [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=537.36s)]
*  Trump. In fact, in the final act of the war, I demanded that Israel bring back a very large [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=541.16s)]
*  group of planes, which were heading directly to Tehran looking for a big day, perhaps the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=545.12s)]
*  final knockout tremendous damage would have been sued and many Iranians would have been [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=551.36s)]
*  killed. It was going to be the biggest attack of the war by far. During the last few days, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=554.88s)]
*  I was working on possible removal of sanctions and other things, which would have given a [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=562.2s)]
*  much better chance to Iran at full, fast and complete recovery. I told you he's like dangling [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=566.12s)]
*  sanctions relief as well as allowing Iran to continue doing in civil plan. It is pretty [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=571.84s)]
*  funny though that Iran's sites are evil. Anti-Semitic is Iran's anti-Semitic sites. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=576.96s)]
*  I was working on the possible removal of sanctions. The sanctions are biting, but no, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=585.12s)]
*  instead I get hit with a statement of anger, hatred and disgust and immediately dropped all [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=590.64s)]
*  work on sanctions relief and more. Iran has to get back into the world order flow or things [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=595.0s)]
*  will only get worse with them. Dog, you blew them up. Like you can't, you can't honestly [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=600.16s)]
*  say why won't you say thank you after you blew them up. It's also additionally funny [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=604.96s)]
*  that he's dropped the negotiations because he's personally, he's personally upset. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=612.8399999999999s)]
*  He's personally upset that the Ayatollah stated that he won instead of groveling at Trump's feet, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  a burned out, they're, they're always so angry, hostile and unhappy. And look at what it has gotten [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=627.3599999999999s)]

*  and death all around them. They have no hope and will only get worse. I wish the leadership [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=639.2s)]

*  I mean, if Iran had killed like 600 plus Americans, including like scientists, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  okay. I don't think Americans will be like, thank you for stopping your, your murder campaign. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=657.5200000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm pretty sure we would nuke Iran if, if Iran had struck America in the way that like [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=665.12s)]
*  Israel and America struck Iran. So I don't know why like this kind of statement comes after [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=671.76s)]
*  ridiculous war crimes took place amidst negotiations. Of course, Iran responded to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=677.76s)]
*  this as well. He said, say it a bus or actually said the complexity and tenacity of Iranians is [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=684.08s)]
*  famously known in our magnificent carpets woven through our countless hours of hard work and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=690.16s)]
*  patience. But as a people, our basic premise is very simple and straightforward. We know our worth [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=694.16s)]
*  value our independence and never allow anyone else to decide our destiny. If president Trump [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=699.36s)]
*  is genuine about wanting a deal, he should put aside the disrespectful and unacceptable tone [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=704.0s)]
*  towards Iran's Supreme leader, grand Ayatollah Khamenei and stop hurting his millions of heartfelt [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=708.16s)]
*  followers. The great and powerful people of Iran who showed the world that the Israeli regime had [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=713.12s)]
*  no choice but to run to daddy to avoid being flattened by our missiles, do not take kindly [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  to threats and insults. If illusions lead to worst mistakes and Rob will not hesitate to unveil its [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=722.56s)]
*  real capabilities, which certainly will end any delusion about the power of Iran. Goodwill begets [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=728.0s)]
*  goodwill and respect begets respect. I mean, they ain't wrong about the run the daddy shit. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=733.1199999999999s)]
*  I like that this is just like the tit for tat, the back and forth that happened between Iran and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  Israel and in America as well, where Iran basically was like, yeah, we don't sure we'll do like a [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=742.56s)]
*  symbolic strike on the, the base and cutter, but our real smoke is with Israel. And then they just, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=748.64s)]
*  even in this process, they're still shitting on Israel. They're like America respect us, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=754.4s)]
*  but also Israel. And we will slap them again as they run to daddy one more time. This is yet [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=758.88s)]
*  another instance where they are unleashing on Israel in a conversation that's supposed to be [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  taking place between the United States of America and Iran, which respect, uh, deserved Israel [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=768.72s)]
*  deserves all of that. All of that resentment to be fair. Yeah. Talk to them, Syed. Anyway, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=776.16s)]
*  it's where we met math teacher, Azita. Do you feel confident that the ceasefire between Israel [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=784.64s)]
*  and Iran will hold this is a war. She says we Iranians have no choice, but to endure the situation [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  in any way we can for so many in Tehran, life remains far from normal. This metropolis is [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=799.5200000000001s)]
*  home to over 9 million people and is the seed of power of the Supreme leader. Unfortunately, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump got some big wins this week. Like what? None of those wins for Trump is a win for the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  American people. Like if Trump got a win, if Trump got a W, like if Trump was able to facilitate a [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=818.24s)]
*  meaningful ceasefire, like a real one, a long lasting piece between Israel and an attempt to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=826.0s)]
*  offer restitution to the Palestinians, I would be the first person on board to say, uh, you know, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=834.08s)]
*  this is obviously coming out, coming after months and months of endless unlimited ethnic cleansing, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=840.56s)]
*  but respect. But if you're considering like the SCOTUS victory to be a victory for Trump, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=846.56s)]
*  yeah, it's a victory for his ambitions, but it's not exactly a victory for the world. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=851.68s)]
*  It's not, it's not exactly a victory for any of us. So if any of these like Republicans, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=856.8s)]
*  for example, consider that to be a victory for them, they're stupid. They don't understand that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=861.76s)]
*  it's not necessarily a victory at all. It's a big week for the unitary executive theory, but how's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  that going to help the average American? It's turning America. It's making America closer [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=869.76s)]
*  and closer to being like a full blown monarchy. The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who still looms large. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=874.0s)]
*  Including at these near daily rallies by victory, Iran is 100% shook. Dude, it's Iran. What are you [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=881.76s)]
*  talking about? If anything, if you're, if you're thinking about it from the perspective of like [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=889.68s)]
*  the Islamic Republic, this isn't exactly bad for the Islamic Republic because now, uh, having an [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=894.4s)]
*  outside infiltrator and outside enemy, uh, kill your civilians on ironically hardens your position. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=900.56s)]
*  People, people looking at this from the outside, look at this and think, oh no, this is, you know, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=908.88s)]
*  destabilization is imminent. But it, but if anything, this kind of stuff actually unites the country [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=913.76s)]
*  regardless of how much resentment even secular forces within the country feel [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=920.56s)]
*  mine supporters, a Khamenei has continued to remain out. Like what is the victory here? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=924.72s)]
*  Iran pulled out of the international atomic energy agency cooperation. Uh, Trump seemingly is [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=930.16s)]
*  signaling that he wants to do sanctions relief and allow them to have a civilian nuclear program [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=936.08s)]
*  once again. If anything, this is a ginormous L for Israel because if America's ambitions with Iran is [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=940.64s)]
*  to normalize relations with Iran, but Israel's ambitions with Iran is to destabilize Iran and [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=946.64s)]
*  destroy Iran. Israel was, uh, Israel was completely incapable of achieving that military objective. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=951.76s)]
*  Like it didn't, it didn't work at all. So what Trump W then I don't think Trump wants to [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=957.9200000000001s)]
*  serve Israel. And now out of sight and Iranians, we've spoken to tell us they feel uncertain [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=964.1600000000001s)]
*  about what might come next. Now, the last time I was here in Tehran was around five years ago, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=970.0s)]
*  and the difference now couldn't be more stark. Despite being globally isolated and under heavy [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  sanctions, this remains a vibrant and cosmopolitan city. But this morning, most businesses still [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=982.4000000000001s)]
*  remain shut and the sense of nervousness is palpable. Adriana. MTS, thank you so much in Tehran. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=988.88s)]
*  Sir, are you concerned at all about secret nuclear sites in Iran? You talk about maybe just secret [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=996.72s)]
*  nuclear sites. Yes, there might be some that can I tell you, they're exhausted and Israel's exhausted [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1001.84s)]
*  too. And I dealt with both of them and they both wanted it settled, both of them. And we did a great [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1007.92s)]
*  job, but they're exhausted. The last thing they're thinking about right now is nuclear. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1016.16s)]
*  You know, they're thinking of they're thinking about tomorrow, trying to live at such a. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1020.88s)]
*  I'm not kidding when I say this, this confirms, I guess my prior biases, but, but it does feel [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1025.68s)]
*  like Israel wasn't necessarily exhausted, but wanted more cooperation from Trump, like a more [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1032.8s)]
*  meaningful entry into the battle to shift Iran's priorities away from striking Israel. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1039.6s)]
*  But because I think he wasn't ready for it partially because I think Israel over promised [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1047.84s)]
*  and under delivered in terms of regime change and how swift it would be. This is again, I'm just like [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1054.72s)]
*  looking at what I'm seeing and making this, this is speculation, right? But it does feel like [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1062.0s)]
*  Israel had ambitious military objectives. The number one being destabilization of the Iranian [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1069.36s)]
*  leadership and you know, full blown rebellion, right? They thought that they could probably [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1077.52s)]
*  get a couple IRGC leaders to evacuate like, you know, blackmail footage or whatever that they [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1085.36s)]
*  could play over and over again to tell the Iranians like it's time for revolution. It's time for a [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1092.7199999999998s)]
*  revolt. These people are over even the IRGC knows this. None of that happened. And they did the most [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1098.32s)]
*  Israel thing they always do, which is blow up a bunch of residential buildings. And that of course [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1104.32s)]
*  pissed off the Iranian people even further. So then even though there were a shit ton of people [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1110.24s)]
*  who are, you know, anti Islamic Republic, they were like, yeah, this, this is crazy. Like, what [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1116.32s)]
*  are you doing? So they weren't able to achieve that major objective. The other objective, I guess, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1121.9199999999998s)]
*  like the one objective that they did achieve seemingly is like the, the other objective that [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1127.52s)]
*  they seemingly did achieve is, is maybe like maintaining air superiority over certain Iranian [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1132.08s)]
*  positions, right? They obviously did do that. That much is clear. But that still did not stop [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1137.6s)]
*  the, the Iranian ballistic missile launchers from successfully sending ballistic missiles into [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1146.8s)]
*  Tel Aviv. And in the process, they showed the world that they are not that they're not impossible [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1153.44s)]
*  to harm. It's such a mess. The place was bombed to hell. And no, I'm not worried about it at all. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1160.96s)]
*  And I'm putting out a little statement. I'm going to respond to the Ayatollah statement yesterday [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  that we won the war, won the war. And I said, look, you're a man of great faith, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1175.6000000000001s)]
*  man who's highly respected in this country. You have to tell the truth. You got beat to hell [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1182.88s)]
*  and Israel was beat up too. They were both beat up and it was a great time to end it. It was quick. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1188.5600000000002s)]
*  They got the hate out. There's a lot of hate, a lot of hate. It would be great if they didn't [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1196.48s)]
*  have that hate. But the last thing they're thinking about is nuclear weapons. Right now. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1200.0800000000002s)]
*  See, you were asking like, does he not show respect to the Ayatollah? He is a revered man. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1206.8s)]
*  And when he speaks, his people listen to him. Your answer is clear. He does. He loves [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1213.4399999999998s)]
*  all authoritarians with the exception of Maduro. I think like he, he does not care. Adversary ally [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1220.8s)]
*  doesn't matter if someone commands great power and great respect over a big chunk of the population. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1230.56s)]
*  And I will never know why he just has like personal smoke for Maduro. He hates Maduro. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1238.56s)]
*  But that's it. Like Maduro is a, is a strong man as well. But for some reason, he just has never [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1245.9199999999998s)]

*  door, as they say, that's the size of a target. And overwhelmingly, and it's amazing what was done [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1325.12s)]
*  with the only guys because Maduro is not a strongman. He's been freely elected and reelected over the [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1333.28s)]
*  years. Come on, dog, you can be elected and still be a strongman. What are you talking about? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1337.84s)]
*  Rizab type out of the one has been freely elected and reelected for years as well. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1342.24s)]
*  And that still doesn't change the reality that he's an authoritarian strongman too. What [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1346.16s)]
*  the ones that could have done it. And we took out the two of the other sites also, in addition to [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1351.68s)]
*  that, we finished them off. That was a very evil intention. I believe that, and again, time will [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1356.72s)]
*  tell, but I don't believe that they're going to go back into nuclear anytime soon. They spent over a [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1363.6s)]
*  trillion dollars on nuclear and they never got it together. And nothing was moved from the site, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1370.16s)]
*  by the way, to do that is very dangerous. It's very, those cars were most likely the cars of [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1375.28s)]
*  masons because they were pouring concrete at the top at the hatch. As you know, the hatch going [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1380.24s)]
*  into the nuclear site, they wanted to reinforce it and they had some masons there pouring concrete. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1385.8400000000001s)]
*  By the way, that concrete was obliterated. It hit exactly at the concrete. It was, I don't think it [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1392.16s)]
*  had a chance to dry, but everything's down there. It's under millions of tons of rock. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1397.68s)]
*  As you go into negotiations and talks with Iran, are you demanding not only that there would be no [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1405.04s)]
*  uranium production inside of Iran, but also that Iran would turn over all existing stockpiles of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1410.48s)]
*  uranium? Well, you know, we're a little early for that, but something like that. Yeah, we'll do [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1416.96s)]
*  something like that. Let me say that I've been saying for 25 years, even as a civilian, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1421.04s)]
*  you cannot let them have a nuclear weapon. And that's what happened. It's been obliterated. It [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1427.76s)]
*  would be years before they could ever get going. And I really think it's probably the last thing. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1433.2s)]
*  They have to recover from a hell of a tough war. Would you also be demanding that the IAEA have [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1437.52s)]
*  full rights to inspect in Iran? Or somebody, yeah, or somebody that we respect, including ourselves. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1443.6000000000001s)]
*  But if, if the intelligence reports conclude that Iran can enrich uranium to a level that concerns [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1449.84s)]
*  you, would you consider bombing the country again? Without question? Absolutely. It has to be [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1457.6s)]
*  unbelievable. Why Americans should support Iran and not Israel by North star radio. Okay. I'm [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1464.56s)]
*  not going to watch this. One stop shop. Oh, alligator Alcatraz. The Iranian people are [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1471.12s)]
*  fighting against the same exact force. Keep him from affording groceries. Why the hell not? Because [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1477.12s)]
*  I've literally described this so many times at this point, I feel like we're going to go over the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1482.08s)]
*  same shit over and over again. And there's Ethan Klein mentions in it, but North star radio always [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1487.1999999999998s)]
*  makes bangers. So I recommend you go watch it on your own time. The Iran is getting bombed. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1493.04s)]
*  What? Question. Why do you not use the add on that shows dislikes? Because they're not real. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1499.6000000000001s)]
*  And I know that from my own personal experience, people will constantly say explosions right now. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1508.48s)]
*  What? Yeah, they're not the, the add on doesn't actually show anything real. People will [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1515.3600000000001s)]
*  constantly talk about how my videos get like a [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL27qYDLPO0&t=1521.76s)]
