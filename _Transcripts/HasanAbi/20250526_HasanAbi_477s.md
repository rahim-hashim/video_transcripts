# Trump Is Cooking America’s Future | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY)
*  Harvard is too many foreigners. We want to know who they are. Yeah. That bill, that bill is in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=0.0s)]
*  Senate for, are you kidding me? There is 0% chance that the bill that currently exists would get past [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  in the Senate. It's demonic. The number I think is lower than 31%. I think it's like 23%. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=14.08s)]
*  23%. But Trump is, is, I don't, or 28%, sorry. I don't know what the he's doing. I'm gonna be [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=20.72s)]
*  honest. I don't know. I don't know what the purpose of this is. Tariffs on the call with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  the trading blocs leader. That was the date she requested. Could we move it from June 1st to July [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=39.36s)]
*  9th? And I agreed to do that. And that she said we will rapidly get together and see if we can work [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=44.4s)]
*  something out. A dramatic shift in tone. Just days ago, the president threatening to impose 50% [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=50.16s)]
*  tariffs on the EU on June 1st, saying talks with one of our largest trading partners are going [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=56.08s)]
*  nowhere. The EU commission leader said she had a good call with Trump and that Europe is ready to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  advance talks swiftly and decisively. The president delaying the tariffs but continues to fight [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  against the country's wealthiest university. A federal judge blocking Trump's ban on international [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  students from enrolling at Harvard University. Part of the problem with Harvard is that there [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=79.2s)]
*  are about 31%, almost 31% of foreigners coming to Harvard. We have Americans that want to go there [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=84.72s)]
*  and to other places. The administration has also frozen billions of dollars in federal funding to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=91.68s)]
*  Harvard, punishing the university for refusing to comply with government demands to change its [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=97.44s)]
*  curriculum, admissions policy and NDEI programs. Harvard's former president blasting the administration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=102.48s)]
*  This is setting America back. It's hard to imagine a larger strategic gift that we could give China [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=109.92s)]
*  than alienating the most talented young people. I mean, he's not wrong. Donald Trump is the great [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  destroyer of American hegemonic power. Like he's not wrong. Larry Summers, who is a demon, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=125.92s)]
*  is unironically 100% correct in his assessment. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  It's so crazy that Donald Trump is burning the candle on both ends. He is just [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=147.44s)]
*  cooking this country. He's cooking R&D. He's cooking America's future. He's cooking [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=152.4s)]
*  some of the last institutions that exist in this country that are tasked with moving American tech [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=157.6s)]
*  into the next century. It's crazy. In the world whose dream was to come to the United States [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=166.56s)]
*  and are now seeing it shattered. And what a hearing on this is set for Thursday to determine [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=176.96s)]
*  if that temporary block should be extended. So for now, the future of nearly 7000 international [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=183.04s)]
*  students at Harvard hangs in the balance. Stand by for more news on that. And Selena, also, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=189.12s)]
*  while we have you another topic here, President Trump also commenting overnight about his one [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=193.92s)]
*  big, beautiful bill and the talks going on in the Senate right now. Yeah, so President Trump said he [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=198.48s)]
*  expects the Senate to make fairly significant changes to the bill, despite House Speaker Mike [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=203.76s)]
*  Johnson just hours earlier saying he wants to see as few changes as possible. Now, the reality here [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  is that this mega bill barely passed the House and it's going to face a tough road ahead in the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=214.0s)]
*  Senate. Some Senate Republicans, they want to see even steeper spending cuts, while other Senate [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=218.16s)]
*  Republicans are concerned about those cuts to Medicaid. All right, Selena, thank you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  Part of the problem with Harvard is that there are about 31 percent, almost 31 percent of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=228.48s)]
*  foreigners coming to Harvard. We give them billions of dollars, which is ridiculous. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=234.16s)]
*  Harvard is too many foreigners. We want to know who they are. Yeah, that bill that bill is in the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  Senate for Are you kidding me? There is zero percent chance that the bill that currently exists [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=244.88s)]
*  would get passed in the Senate. It's demonic. The number I think is lower than 31 percent. I think [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  it's like 23 percent, but Trump is, is I don't or 28 percent. Sorry. I don't know what the he's doing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=259.2s)]
*  I'm going to be honest. I don't know. I don't know what the purpose of this is. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=269.12s)]
*  Okay. Like, oh, God damn, we don't know. We don't know who these foreigners are. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=272.56s)]
*  You know, we do grants, which we're probably not going to be doing much grants anymore to Harvard, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  but there are 31 percent, but they refuse to tell us who the people are. We want to know the people. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=283.52s)]
*  Now, a lot of the foreign students we wouldn't have a problem with. I'm not going to have a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=288.96s)]
*  problem with foreign students, but it shouldn't be 31 percent. It's too much because we have [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=292.24s)]
*  Americans that want to go there and to other places and they can't go there because you have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=296.64s)]
*  31 percent foreign. Now, no foreign government contributes money to Harvard. We do. So why are [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=302.32s)]
*  they doing so many number one? Wait, what? It's not a foreign government contribution to Harvard. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=308.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=317.12s)]
*  Oh, claiming that why would yeah. Yeah. Okay. I don't talk to me right now. Sorry. I'm doing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=321.84s)]
*  news coverage. So what I was going to say is, ironically enough, the foreign students do actually [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=328.8s)]
*  fund Harvard. It's not my mom. It's my brother. He's trying to talk to me. So the when he's like, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=335.36s)]
*  foreign nations don't actually fund Harvard. We do. It's like, no, they do actually. Foreign [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=342.32s)]
*  nationals fund Harvard by enrolling and paying exorbitant fees. The idea that like, this is not [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=347.68s)]
*  part of the backbone of the Harvard endowment is so funny. And not only that, but also we rely on [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=355.76s)]
*  their research. We rely on the fucking research that like foreigners contribute to. Couldn't you [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=362.4s)]
*  also say foreign countries fund universities with APAC or other organizations or similarly give [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=368.96s)]
*  donations to schools like Harvard? First of all, how dare you say something so anti-Semitic as to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  as to as to suggest that APAC is in the interest of a foreign nation? Excuse me, I cannot believe [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=378.8s)]
*  I cannot I cannot believe the unimaginable anti-Semitism coming from you chatter. How dare you [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=389.44s)]
*  say that the American Israel pack, that's what the I stands for would be in the interest of Israel, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=394.96s)]
*  a foreign nation. There's nothing more anti-Semitic to suggest an APAC being a lobby for a foreign [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=402.08s)]
*  government. Number two, we want a list of those foreign students and we'll find out whether or [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=407.76s)]
*  not they're okay. Many will be okay, I assume. And I assume with Harvard, many will be. And then the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=413.76s)]
*  other thing is, okay, guys, I'm working. Okay, we can't. And that's got to stop. It's crazy. My [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=420.96s)]
*  whole family is just like having a continued conversation with me while this is going on. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=427.44s)]
*  But here, mom, you can have this salad with shawarma. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=434.48s)]
*  And then also, I'll give you my phone, you can order whatever. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  It's just rice. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=448.8s)]
*  Okay. Well, it's open. The back of it is open. One day off and your family thinks you're retired. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=455.2s)]
*  It's so cute. Yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  Immediately. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEg7So98LyY&t=469.92s)]
