# The Kurds And Their Relationship With Turkey | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ)
*  and protectorate of the Turkish government in an effort to sidestep, like allowing like an Israel style formation of ethnic Kurds that would never be allowed by any of the regional actors in general. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. I see you baited me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=14.24s)]
*  Yes, I know there's PKK news chat chat. This is entirely too complicated for me to go into. Okay, I need to do a lot more reading on it. But my initial assessment on this is most likely the Egypt I batted on trying to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=16.44s)]
*  set a set the stage for like a Kurdish nation state potentially, but like that is directly in control or directly under the control and protectorate of the Turkish government in an effort to sidestep, like allowing like an Israel style formation of ethnic Kurds that would never be allowed by any of the regional actors in general. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=42.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. I see you baited me. You baited me into talking about it. Jesus. Jesus. Lord mercy. I low key don't even, I don't know. I don't know enough. I don't know enough about the dynamics, but most likely like maybe a Kurdish autonomous region or something like that. God, I'm so I'm such a, I'm such a lame ass. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=68.76s)]
*  Why are there Turks ashamed of being Arabs? I mean, Turkish people are as a direct byproduct of the Ottoman Empire, not just Arab, they're Turkic most first and foremost. There is a lot of Arab in there as well. But but also there's Greek, you know what I mean? There's Balkan in there too. There's just a bunch of different things. So that's the reason why they get very mad. Well, partially because they also, you know, there's a little bit of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=94.04s)]
*  opinion baked into it, but it's also incorrect. And it's a it's one of those unique dynamics where it's basically it's no it's not dissimilar to saying that a Kurd is Turkish, right? Like a Kurdish person will say no, I'm Kurdish. I'm not Turkish, right? And it's similar to that where a lot in the Western world think that like Turkish people, Kurdish people, Iranian people, and Arabs are all [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=124.04s)]
*  a monolith. They're all the same. And so that's part of the reason why a lot of people correct the record on it. And then the other reason why they get really mad about it is because they're also kind of anti Arab. Some Turks are let's be real, not me. But you know, some Turks certainly are. But yeah, it's partially it's partially because of Western racism and partially because of some opinions that maybe some people have let's be real if I'm being brutally honest. You know, so there is a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=154.04s)]
*  some good reason for Turks to get upset because obviously like one of the most common matters, when at least I was growing up and would like visit America was, oh, you ride a camel to you live in a tent and you ride a camel to work. You ride a camel to your school, right? Like that's what people thought, which is weird because like the almost the entirety of the Arab region does not do that either. Like you're talking about a very specific subsect of like tribal people tribal populations and like Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=184.04s)]
*  Or some shit like it's crazy. Imagine being like, Oh, are you Syrian? You must be riding a camel to work. It's just regular as Western supremacist thought Orientalism, racism, you know, all of it. You don't understand. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=214.04s)]
*  Kurdish DNA is to be socialist Arabs DNA Islamist Turkish DNA Japanese wannabe. That's funny. Yes, I know who the Democrats pick for the joint address. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4YRI8055EQ&t=230.04s)]
