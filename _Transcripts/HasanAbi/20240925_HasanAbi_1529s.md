# Can 1 Woke Teen Survive 20 Trump Supporters? | Hasanabi Reacts to Jubilee
**HasanAbi:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ)
*  Wait, you actually believe that? Yes, I do believe that. Okay, so you are just like Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not. Oh wow, you're calling a Hispanic and a Cuban. You might have- [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Oh my god, my man thought he deployed that. He thought he had that locked the f*** down, dude. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=7.2s)]
*  Nice. Wow, I can't believe you're calling a Cuban latin. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=14.32s)]
*  The Ken 1 woke teen survived 20 Trump supporters the jubilee video. I've been seeing a lot of the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=22.88s)]
*  clips from this. Would be better than Trump. The first category is character. Speaking of which, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=26.8s)]
*  you know, if we're bringing up stuff from the past, we can say she slept with Willie Brown, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  broke up a family just to get her job. She got 4.5 million votes to get into AG and DA and slept [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=34.0s)]
*  with zero of them. You don't know that though. You know that? No, absolutely not. Okay, so you think [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=39.6s)]
*  that she slept with 4.5 million people? I'm sure, but the one person that she did- [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=43.36s)]
*  Are you serious? Was the most important person that she did- Did you just say that she had to sleep [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  with 4.5 million people? No. My name is Dean Withers. I'm a 19 year old liberal. I do political [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  debate for a living. Today, I'm surrounded by 20 Trump supporters. My first claim is Donald Trump is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=54.48s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't understand how people get this idea that Trump is, you know, my family [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=70.96s)]
*  came from a communist country. They came from Cuba and they came from Mexico. So I don't see [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  anything or any statement that he's ever made. That's, I mean, there's things that there's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=80.32s)]
*  accusations, but there's no facts behind it. And this whole idea that all Hispanics are [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  illegal immigrants and they came here. For the record, that guy in the blue suit has a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=90.32s)]
*  record of stalking. Isn't he also like a, isn't he like a Republican operative? Am I crazy? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Documented is not true because my family came here on both sides from through the legal immigration [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=102.08s)]
*  process, not illegally here. Okay. So that was a bold claim. You just said that, you know, there's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=108.32s)]
*  no facts to substantiate the idea that Donald Trump is going to be. So in the 1970s, there's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=112.56s)]
*  civil litigation held against him by the DOJ, the state of New York for literally not renting to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=116.72s)]
*  black people. What they did is they'd send in quote unquote testers to his rental properties at the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=120.96s)]
*  time. They'd send in a white person. The white person would ask the property manager if they [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=125.6s)]
*  had any available properties to rent. They'd say, yes, here we go. Here's housing application. Then [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=129.76s)]
*  they'd send in a black tester that asks the same question. And then they'd actually be denied. When [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=133.84s)]
*  this was investigated by the DOJ, the property manager told them that this was just a quote, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=138.48s)]
*  unquote order from the higher up from this boss from Donald Trump. And then they investigated [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=142.32s)]
*  Donald Trump, brought civil litigation against him. And they, yeah, they essentially determined [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=146.56s)]
*  that, yeah, he wasn't renting to black people. And which he then had a promise the DOJ that he was [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=151.12s)]
*  no longer going to racially profile in his housing application and even how to put ads in the New [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=155.12s)]
*  York newspaper at the time saying that he'd rent to black people. So what you're saying is basically [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=160.72s)]
*  he's not renting to black people, but yet he employs a lot of minorities. He employs a lot of blacks, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=164.96s)]
*  Asians, Hispanics onto his staff. So why wouldn't he be renting to black people? That doesn't make [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=169.92s)]
*  any sense. Also, it seems to me that, but also is an example that the Department of Justice is against [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=175.2s)]
*  people that do something in life. Can you give me any evidence for that? I'll give you evidence of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=180.24s)]
*  that. Yes, I will. Because Trump was political for a very long time. He made political statements. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=184.88s)]
*  He was very unpopular with a lot of Democrats. He would say things that they didn't like, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=189.76s)]
*  and they would go after him. They would use the Department of Justice, just like they are right [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  now. They're using the Department of Justice against him. They're using the government for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=198.56s)]
*  their political power to go against him because they disagree with his political opinion. That's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  what they do. The Democrats have been going after him for years, even considering he used to be a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  registered Democrat. So I don't believe that Trump is whatsoever. I don't see that piece. I see his [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=213.2s)]
*  employees. I've been to a lot of his properties in the past, and I know that he hires a lot of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=218.4s)]
*  minorities. So I don't believe that to be true. Okay. So your claim here is that, well, he actually [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=222.4s)]
*  didn't do what the DOJ accused him and held him liable for doing. Yeah, but the DOJ says a lot of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=227.36s)]
*  things. It doesn't make it true. Let me finish real quick. So you're saying that the DOJ actually was [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=232.0s)]
*  unfairly persecuting Donald Trump, a political opponent. In the 70s, he wasn't running for any [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=235.84s)]
*  public office. So I don't know why you'd say that was a political opponent. But maybe we could look [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=239.84s)]
*  at a more intuitive example. Well, he's made political statements in the 70s as well. Okay. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=243.6s)]
*  So your claim is that the DOJ was unfairly persecuting him. Do you have any evidence of that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  If you go back, do you have any evidence why the DOJ was investigating him in the first place? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=251.92s)]
*  Yeah, because they'd got... No, there's no evidence. I mean, the DOJ has been an illegitimate [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=256.56s)]
*  organization for a very long time. So they make a lot of statements, but it doesn't mean that they're [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  going to actually... Did they actually go through with anything? Nothing really happened at the end [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=265.2s)]
*  of the day. It was just a witch hunt at the end of the day. Okay. Well, I mean, I don't think you'd [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=269.12s)]
*  have any evidence for the claim that it was a witch hunt. I think that at the end of the day, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  this is a conspiracy theory. I think that Donald Trump has... Conspiracy theory? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=275.36s)]
*  Might I finish real quick? Thanks. So I think that at the end of the day, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  this is going to be a conspiracy theory. I think that the DOJ does this... I'm sorry. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  That Donald Trump would perpetuate a lot of conspiracy theories. He did this with the outcome [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=284.48s)]
*  of the 2020 election. But let's look at another example that's not coming from the DOJ or the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=287.76s)]
*  criminal justice system. We're referencing 2012 through 2014. Donald Trump said that because [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=292.48s)]
*  Barack Obama is black, he's obviously not a US born citizen. So therefore he obviously... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=298.64s)]
*  He did not say that he was black. He's not a US born citizen. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=303.12s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the birther movement. Right? So I just have a quick question. What [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=305.92s)]
*  did you say trying to take... There was legitimacy questioning his... [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=308.64s)]
*  Oh, damn, dude. So when they put up the flags that... For those of you who don't remember [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=311.68s)]
*  the rules, if they put up 11 flags, then he has to get swapped out. But because I think [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=317.6s)]
*  Trump supporters are, I believe, then even then Kamala supporters are, the people are probably [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=325.2s)]
*  not going to throw up the flags as fast. Birth certificate. Questioning his birth certificate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=332.56s)]
*  What's the legitimacy there? There is some questioning. His family came from Kenya. How [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=338.4s)]
*  is he running for president? Wait, Donald Trump's mother is a Scottish immigrant. Should we question [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=341.04s)]
*  his birth certificate? They came here through the legal process. He didn't come here through [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=344.64s)]
*  the legal process. Wait, so you're saying that Obama's parents were undocumented migrants? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=347.92s)]
*  Which would have to be qualified in his presidency. I just want to answer your question. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=351.68s)]
*  Which would have to be qualified. I want to ask you a question. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who I'm friends [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=355.28s)]
*  with, looked into the claims of that birth certificate and there was questions of whether [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=360.8s)]
*  it was falsified. Wait, you actually believe that? Yes, I do believe that. Okay, so you were just like [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=365.68s)]
*  Donald Trump. Oh, wow. You're calling a Hispanic and a Cuban. Oh my God. My man thought he deployed [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=370.88s)]
*  that. He thought he had that locked the down, dude. Nice. Wow. I can't believe you're calling a Cuban [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Latino man. Why don't I take 30 seconds here? All right. So first of all, yes. Another white liberal. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=384.24s)]
*  All right. All right. Want to start where you guys left off? Yeah. I think that hopefully we [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=389.6s)]
*  could slow things down a little bit here, have some productive conversations. So yeah, how about [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  I just start off by giving you my reasons why I think that Donald Trump is so... With the last guy, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  we kind of touched on the civil litigation that was held against him in the 1970s for not renting [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=404.8s)]
*  to black people. But I want to focus upon a more intuitive example. Proponing the idea that Barack [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=408.8s)]
*  Obama was not a U.S. born citizen. So first, I just want to ask you a very simple question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=416.56s)]
*  What do you say trying to take away opportunity from a black man because he's black is... [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=420.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to be honest, yes, I do believe that. Okay. But I think we also have to look into what [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=424.48s)]
*  the administration when he was in office did, not what happened back in 1970 when he wasn't even in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=428.88s)]
*  office. It was a complete different administration making the rules. Okay. When he was in office, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=435.76s)]
*  he gave opportunity zones, gave funding to HBCUs. He also implemented the First Step Act, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=440.24s)]
*  which I feel like liberals really focus on like, Oh, our... The HBCUs, dude, every administration [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=446.88000000000005s)]
*  has funded HBCUs. And if I'm, I don't remember the exact details, but the Trump administration's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  funding HBCUs was not exactly... The Trump administration's HBCU funding wasn't exactly [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=460.48s)]
*  great either. Prison system has a majority of African-Americans in there. So we gave them an [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=467.68s)]
*  opportunity to get out early, to start a new life. So I think if we're going to go back and look at [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  some stuff of the 1970s, that's not really fair because there's a lot of people on the Democrat [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=477.68s)]
*  side that have done worse things while in office. Joe Biden, who, when he was a senator, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=484.0s)]
*  pushed to get African-Americans incarcerated at a higher rate, like actions speak louder than [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=491.12s)]
*  words at the end of the day. And what Trump did in office helped the black community at an [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=497.12s)]
*  exponential amount compared to all the other administrations on the Democratic party. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=502.48s)]
*  Okay. So you're saying what he did in office helped African-Americans more than other [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=506.88s)]
*  administrations. You referenced historically black universities. Do you know how much funding he [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=510.48s)]
*  sent to HBCUs? A decent amount. I can't give you the exact numbers. So the exact amount was $250 [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=516.08s)]
*  million per year. Do you know how much Obama's administration and Biden's administration have [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=521.92s)]
*  sent? I would like to hear. Obama sent $1 billion a year and Biden sent $4 billion a year. So not [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=526.48s)]
*  only did he decrease funding to historically black universities, all right, but also you referenced [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=531.04s)]
*  the First Step Act there. How did Donald Trump influence the First Step Act to get passed? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=535.36s)]
*  Through Congress. Well, how did he influence that bill through Congress? Answer that question for [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=539.44s)]
*  me. Because he didn't influence it. In fact, it was proposed to Congress under Obama's administration [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  and it was shot down. And then something else I did want to... But at the end of the day, as president, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  he has the ability to sign or send a bill back to Congress. He signed it. If he was truly, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=552.24s)]
*  he would not have signed it in the first place. Okay. But at the end of the day, he still signed [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=556.48s)]
*  it. He has that ability. Just like every president before, if they don't like a bill, they have the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=560.48s)]
*  ability to send it right back to Congress and there's congressional means to get it passed [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=564.4s)]
*  without the president's approval. But still, he signed it. If he's really, why did he sign it [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=568.24s)]
*  in the first place? Yeah. Well, I don't think that we could just ignore Trump saying that Obama [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=572.64s)]
*  isn't a US born citizen and he's probably from Kenya. I don't think that we could ignore... [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=577.76s)]
*  Do you mind if I finish here, sir? Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. I don't think that we could ignore the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=583.28s)]
*  civil litigation against him in the 1970s for not renting to black people. I don't think we could [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=586.16s)]
*  ignore his recent comments about Kamala Harris saying that she turned black implying that she [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=590.56s)]
*  wasn't black prior just because he signed the First Step Act into law. I understand that does [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  do something for the African-American community, but I don't think we could say because he did [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=598.48s)]
*  this one thing that all of these other examples are null and void. You also referenced Joe Biden [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  there. I have no problem saying that Joe Biden has a past. In fact, I think that's something I [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=606.32s)]
*  need to recognize and we should all recognize. But what I can't stand is when I hear people [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=611.12s)]
*  denying Trump's saying it never occurred when it's so obvious. But at the end of the day, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=615.2s)]
*  what I'm trying to explain right now is that Biden has signed bills into law, voted for them [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=619.2s)]
*  that hurt the community. Trump has not done anything to that extent. Sure, he says some [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=626.32s)]
*  things for maybe a little bit if he way back. You're saying things were back in the 1970s [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=631.6s)]
*  that did not even have like that he couldn't even like sign a law or anything like that because he [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  wasn't even in office. Okay, I guess what I want to start with is looking at the actual word. I [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=642.24s)]
*  think nowadays it's a word that people throw around kind of like the word love. It is a very [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=649.28s)]
*  powerful word. It has a lot of negative connotation. It has a lot of power that comes with it. When I [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  think of millions of Jews, when I think of the Ottoman Turks, 1.5 million of my people, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=658.48s)]
*  I think of that. I don't think of Trump who maybe he said things in the past, this or that. If we [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=664.16s)]
*  want to go about talking about saying things, Biden said Obama is one of the first mainstream [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=669.52s)]
*  blacks to be bright and intelligent. He said that you can only walk into a 7-Eleven if you have an [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=674.72s)]
*  Indian accent. He has said that if you vote for Trump over him, you're not black. He said so many [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=679.9200000000001s)]
*  of these things in his past and the prompt is talking about is Trump. But to me, it's not about [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=685.2s)]
*  that because of how the media has displayed. They just focus on Trump and it is about both sides. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=690.6400000000001s)]
*  They don't touch upon Biden. They don't talk about Biden. And when you look at his policies, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=696.24s)]
*  like my friend mentioned, if Trump was or he would not be passing policies, he wouldn't even [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=700.72s)]
*  give a dollar to these black universities. If he truly had this, it's an intention of the heart. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=705.84s)]
*  And I'll go out and I'll step out and say, I'm sure everybody here has said something in their [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=711.04s)]
*  life. That doesn't make you. It's kind of like if you weigh 400 pounds and you eat celery, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=715.28s)]
*  you're not skinny. All these examples that you're talking about are from years and years ago. What [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  has he done that's in the last maybe five, 10 years? Ten years ago, 2014, Trump was actively [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=725.52s)]
*  proponing Barack Obama's birther myth. The idea that he was not born in the US. But you already [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=731.76s)]
*  said that example. Give me something new. Because that's... Okay, fine. Yeah, sure. I mean, you're [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=736.64s)]
*  asking for some of the last five to 10 years. That was 10 years ago. I thought that I'd just go [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=740.08s)]
*  over that again. Another reason why I wanted to go over that again with you is because how [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=743.12s)]
*  intuitively it is, right? Denying or saying that a black man should have less opportunity because [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=747.12s)]
*  of the color of his skin is very obviously... When did he make that comment? Yeah. So the whole [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=751.76s)]
*  birther myth with Barack Obama, right? Essentially hoped to achieve that he wasn't born in the US. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  He was born in Kenya. I mean, there's also one of my favorite ones is when he said that a Mexican [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  American judge, like an American judge of Mexican descent could not adequately legislate or could [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=767.6s)]
*  not adequately adjudicate over his court proceedings because he was Mexican. That was... I mean, dude, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=776.08s)]
*  there's so much... Like Donald Trump is so... He's such a target rich environment, you know? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=783.6s)]
*  Yeah. And because he's not a US born citizen, he shouldn't have the opportunity to run for US [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=788.64s)]
*  president. The only reason he said that is because of the color of Barack Obama's skin. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  But has he explicitly said he said that specifically because he's black or are [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=796.24s)]
*  you just taking that assumption? Okay. So what else? What explanation do we have here? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=800.64s)]
*  I've said everything I need to say. I'm waiting on you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay. So, I mean, well, yeah, I think that looking at Barack Obama saying that he was born in Africa [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=808.4s)]
*  and then even denying his birth certificate from Hawaii, still attributing his birth to Africa, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=814.08s)]
*  I don't really see any other explanation apart from that besides the fact that Barack Obama [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=819.92s)]
*  has black skin. And then another example from like... [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=823.68s)]
*  That's also a comment. That wasn't an action. That was a comment. He's... [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=825.12s)]
*  Okay. What action has he taken part in the last five, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=828.4799999999999s)]
*  10 years that have been against not even just blacks, against other races? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=831.52s)]
*  All right. First, I don't think that we should call African-Americans blacks. I think that's [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=835.28s)]
*  a dehumanizing word. But second of all... That's your opinion, but... [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=838.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Sorry. Second of all, right, even if we look at the last month or two, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=842.16s)]
*  I'd say that saying Kamala Harris, right, quote unquote, turned black, implying that she wasn't [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=847.3599999999999s)]
*  black prior, that's another comment. We could also reference that as a debate... [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=850.8s)]
*  Because she plays with that. One day she's Indian, one day she's black. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=855.76s)]
*  Hello. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=860.16s)]
*  Howdy. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  Very nice to meet you. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=861.4599999999999s)]
*  So nice to meet you as well. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=862.4799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, you're looking back at Donald Trump's history. One thing I do want to say, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you are aware, Palm Beach didn't used to let African-Americans there. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=869.12s)]
*  Donald Trump sued the city of Palm Beach to allow black membership at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  That is not... I think one of the problems that we have a lot on the left, every time there's a [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=881.2s)]
*  disagreement, we get thrown, you're a juror sexist, you're this, you're that. And it dissolves the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=887.2s)]
*  discussions that we should be having on policies. Secondly, Donald Trump worked with Senator Scott [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=893.2s)]
*  to create opportunity zones in black communities. If he was truly a... It's not something that he [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=900.32s)]
*  would do. So I think the whole premise is he's a sexist, takes away from policy positions that [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=906.72s)]
*  we should be discussing. If we go to the border and we talk about rapists and, yeah, they are [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=914.0s)]
*  happening, Lake and Riley is now dead. We have 300,000 missing migrant children known sold into [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=920.64s)]
*  the sex trade, per the last IG report. These are important issues. Our economy is important issues. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=927.28s)]
*  Do you mind if I ask you a question? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=933.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=934.8s)]
*  Are you a US born citizen? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=935.68s)]
*  100%. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=937.28s)]
*  You're statistically speaking four times more likely to commit a violent crime than an undocumented [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=937.76s)]
*  migrant. So when you kind of... [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=942.88s)]
*  They shouldn't be here. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  They shouldn't be here. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=945.68s)]
*  Okay. All right. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=946.8s)]
*  And my husband's an immigrant. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=947.68s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. But also... [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=949.8399999999999s)]
*  A legal immigrant. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=950.88s)]
*  Okay. Wait, what? Is she saying and he shouldn't be here? Like what? Oh, she said legal. Okay. My [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=951.8399999999999s)]
*  bad. For a second, I thought she was just leaking. Yeah. My husband isn't a legal immigrant and he [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=961.2800000000001s)]
*  should not be in this country. You know what I mean? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=969.6s)]
*  We came here legally. We've got 100 ISIS in our country right now that was reported. We've got [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=972.0s)]
*  Godaways. We've got Tende Deir Agua. I've interviewed Oscar Blue, who's been through the Darien gap four [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=979.36s)]
*  times. People are dying. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=985.84s)]
*  Okay. So you're saying that we have a crisis at the southern border. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=987.44s)]
*  Well, I'm saying that you're saying that Donald Trump is... Donald Trump loves America. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=990.64s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Well, first of all, I want to... [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=994.72s)]
*  And he puts Americans first. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=995.76s)]
*  I want to ask you one simple question first, and maybe we could get back to the prompt. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=996.96s)]
*  Do you think that we have a crisis at the southern border today? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=999.76s)]
*  100%. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1002.16s)]
*  So you'd say that we also had a crisis at the southern border at the end of Trump's term [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1003.04s)]
*  because we have the same amount of daily crossings today than them? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1006.08s)]
*  No, we do not have the same amount of crossings. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1008.08s)]
*  We have about 2,400 crossings today than after Biden's encounter border. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1009.68s)]
*  14,000 crossings a day. The Biden-Harris administration put us back into what's called [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  the global compact of migration. They are now using an app where they use our refugee [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1018.48s)]
*  resettlement program to fly people into our country to different states. So for you to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1023.76s)]
*  say that the Trump administration that did not have catch and release, that is not... [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1028.96s)]
*  And Biden put it back in. And then we also had remain in Mexico, which on day one of [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1035.6s)]
*  Biden's administration, he... [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1042.56s)]
*  It's just mental illness. I mean, yeah, that's like 90% of right-wing commentary. Most of what [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1045.2s)]
*  holds the Republican right together is just that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1056.64s)]
*  Wiped out. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1060.64s)]
*  Because it was ineffective. I mean, we could look at... [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1061.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, it was very effective. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1063.0400000000002s)]
*  Do you mind if I talk real quick? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1064.16s)]
*  It's just propaganda. It's what you've heard from CNN and MSNBC. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1067.0400000000002s)]
*  Actually, how about I provide you a source that isn't CNN, isn't MSNBC, and it's actually a... [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1071.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, she's talking about illegal immigration being a problem, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1077.0400000000002s)]
*  but our examples are of legal immigration, which includes her husband, which is why [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1079.5200000000002s)]
*  a lot of these people play fast and loose with the truth. Okay? Like for her, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1085.2800000000002s)]
*  she does not understand the fundamental reality that the difference between a legal immigrant [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1092.24s)]
*  and an illegal immigrant is just paperwork. Okay? And the difference between her and a legal or [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1096.88s)]
*  illegal immigrant is simply the amount of time that she has spent on US soil. That's usually [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1102.8000000000002s)]
*  the difference because at a certain point, her family members came not from America. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay? So obviously, this entire argument is cooked. This is precisely the reason why [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1116.48s)]
*  it is hilarious. And also openly, whenever Republicans will be like, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1122.88s)]
*  I don't care that they're legally here. It's because Kamala waved the wand. That's what [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1127.44s)]
*  JD Vance said. Right? That's what JD Vance said. She met her husband, is a felon, ain't no way. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1131.2800000000002s)]
*  Wait, what? God damn it, dude. Oh my Lord. Top of the hour streamer. Thanks, man. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1137.44s)]
*  Republicans have gotten way more comfortable with their narratives, and that's why they usually... [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1144.16s)]
*  They now say these things. That's why they now openly say these things like even legal immigrants [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1149.6000000000001s)]
*  should be made illegal. Because it's not... There's no real like economic reason or purpose or [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1156.24s)]
*  anything like this. It's just simply pure animus, pure hatred. Okay? Anyway, speaking of pure hatred, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1161.1200000000001s)]
*  the three minute ad break is upon us. You guys cooked me. Here it is. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1168.72s)]
*  Source from Donald Trump's rally. So remember when Donald Trump got shot in his ear? What did he have [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1172.16s)]
*  behind him? It was the chart that showed the lowest crossings in history. What if I talk about [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1177.12s)]
*  that chart? I have the chart. Should we bring it out? You have the chart with you? Yeah, I do. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1181.28s)]
*  Bring the chart out. Can you hand me my purse, someone? Like you have like an actual picture [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1185.9199999999998s)]
*  of the chart? I do. Phenomenal. Let's look at the chart. She is prepared. This is great. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  By the way, this entire time she's been like saying some of the most insane unhinged... Okay. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1195.1999999999998s)]
*  Only two people have raised a red flag. Like the quality control from Republicans against [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1200.8s)]
*  other Republicans. This is like a more holistic approach to the subject matter here. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1206.8s)]
*  But I do find it really interesting because we watched the Charlie Kirk video, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1212.32s)]
*  which is a professional political pundit going up against like a bunch of [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1216.96s)]
*  Tik Tokers at the most and just like random liberals at best. Right? And in that situation, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1221.36s)]
*  the way that other liberals that were waiting to talk to Charlie Kirk were definitely trying to [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1228.08s)]
*  speak over one another. We're flagging each other over and over again. Right? Whereas like the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1233.6000000000001s)]
*  conservatives, as long as you say the words, it doesn't matter to them. Does that make sense? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1239.2800000000002s)]
*  As long as you say the words, it doesn't really matter. They're not even... They're letting her [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1246.0s)]
*  cook. They're letting her sit there and say whatever the f*** she wants. It doesn't matter if this sounds unhinged. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1249.7600000000002s)]
*  Extraordinary. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1256.3200000000002s)]
*  They win by just not raising the flag. Why do liberals think this can be done in good faith? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1259.84s)]
*  They revel in bad faith. Yeah. You are also not going to hear a diversity of opinion on this. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  Maybe a little bit, but not to the same degree as all the liberals that had so many different [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1269.28s)]
*  perspectives that they wanted to tackle the issue from. It goes to show the ease in which it is to [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1276.3999999999999s)]
*  become a conservative spokesperson. Make no mistake, this is not a targeted, deliberate effort [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1281.76s)]
*  to instill some kind of messaging discipline. It is simply because the talking points rely on [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1288.16s)]
*  pre-existing hurt and harm for the most part, and they almost always appeal to the lowest common [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1294.96s)]
*  denominator. And the talking points are also... Do you understand? Oh, it's on your phone. I thought [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1301.1200000000001s)]
*  that you had like an actual... Well, it's a picture. We can hold it up to the camera if they want to see it. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. Well, maybe we could just reference the data on that chart. So you're referencing the [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1311.52s)]
*  Remain in Mexico policy. So that was one of Donald Trump's day ones. He only had increasing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1315.92s)]
*  border numbers until the day he signed Title 42 into effect. Year by year, they only increase. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1320.5600000000002s)]
*  Is that what border... Remain in Mexico policy, the wall, it was all incredibly ineffective [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1325.44s)]
*  border legislation. He couldn't get Congress together to pass anything, so then he had to [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1330.0s)]
*  re-approval the wall. That's not true. Congress passed H.R.2. It's been sitting on Chuck Schumer's [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1333.3600000000001s)]
*  desk since May of 2023. It was the one bill that would secure the border. Border Patrol has endorsed [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1339.84s)]
*  President Trump. Law enforcement has endorsed President Trump. Okay. The Biden administration [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1348.56s)]
*  and the Harris administration have failed this nation, and they have allowed this invasion of [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  our country, and Americans are dying. And sorry, these gang members should not be here. I have a [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1362.0s)]
*  question. So what do you say? We had an undocumented migrant that was like a felon. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1367.28s)]
*  So here's the situation. Here's the problem also. Like it takes no effort to just tell a lie, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1371.2s)]
*  but an untold amount of effort, countless hours to tell the truth, correcting the record in these [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1379.28s)]
*  situations is going to be quite difficult to engage with, especially in a quick manner, right? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1385.6s)]
*  It's difficult. It's always, it's always a very difficult task, which is, you know, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1393.36s)]
*  part of the problem here as well. A sexual abuser, right? A violent offender that they shouldn't be [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1399.4399999999998s)]
*  allowed in the country. A hundred percent. None of these people should be without process. Okay. So [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1404.4799999999998s)]
*  my question to you would be, well, then why do you want a criminal felon sexual abuser to run the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1409.04s)]
*  country? Because I believe that we're suffering from an extreme case of lawfare, which I can [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1413.52s)]
*  bro, she was way too quick in retaliating to that. Like she, that's shocking because I think he did a [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1418.96s)]
*  good job. I think he did a good job with that line. That was a bar, but she literally didn't even [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1425.6s)]
*  flinch. Dude. She was like, yeah, I don't give a, yeah, he's a rapist and I love him. He's my rapist [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1432.8s)]
*  like prove. And you know, when you look at, let's take for instance, the New York case, the one that [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1438.0s)]
*  he's going to probably go to jail for, even though he's not guilty, the 34 felonies, the 34 [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1445.2s)]
*  felonies that they changed the statute of limitations in order to prosecute him. Oh, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1450.4s)]
*  that they changed your case is confused. So they didn't change any statute. Oh yes, they did. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1455.52s)]
*  One second. I know what you're referencing. If you'll just allow me. Yes, they did. Just allow me, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1459.68s)]
*  but not only might I just have 30, 30 seconds. Well, we only have 40 seconds left. I just want [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1462.88s)]
*  to clarify. They didn't change. You've got the seat the whole time. Okay. We have 35 seconds left. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1466.8s)]
*  What were his felonies for? Okay. So let's not talk about that. Let's talk about the plain and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1471.2s)]
*  simple fact that they moved the number three from Biden's DOJ to a state case. Let's talk about the [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1475.52s)]
*  fact that Mark Pomerantz who worked in the Biden administration, basically pled the fifth, six time [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1482.48s)]
*  when he said that he was talking to brag and he would not talk about that. Alvin Bragg ran on [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1488.64s)]
*  getting Trump. Let's talk about judge Merchant's daughter, Laura, who's making millions for the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1495.44s)]
*  Harris administration and the Biden administration right now in order to prosecute Trump. That is [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1501.04s)]
*  recusal. It's going to get dropped at the Supreme court. Alvin Bragg should have recused himself. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1508.3200000000002s)]
*  Judge Merchant should have recused himself. I like your power. My next claim is Donald Trump [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1513.8400000000001s)]
*  doesn't care about the American people. I completely disagree with. Wait, it's the same guy again. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1518.64s)]
*  What is happening, bro? Dude, God, conservatives are so [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YMwOKpQuQ&t=1523.76s)]
