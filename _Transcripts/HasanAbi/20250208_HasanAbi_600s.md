*  I didn't realize he was going to come out and say that like it's true, but it's like, it's one of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  those things where just because it's true, you shouldn't say it. You know what I mean? You [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=101.92s)]
*  probably shouldn't say it because it's true, right? Like I didn't realize he openly would [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=106.24s)]
*  say that he mocks me fix the stream. You are red. Like the quail ludes guy. What? No, I'm not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=112.88s)]

*  Oh, they're, they're back to their sweeping ways. There was like a, there was like a one day period [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=157.28s)]
*  where Lsf allowed Lsf allowed clips to be out and now it's gone. I find your haters and chest streams. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=163.52s)]
*  Yeah. It's funny when they go to like people that I like and people who I sometimes collaborate with [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=173.68s)]
*  and stuff like that. And then they will do stuff like this. Look at this. Look at the mania. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=181.04000000000002s)]

*  industry. Fuck Hassan. I love when people use the term industry. Like we're not all just like [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=191.6s)]
*  balding men saying c***. You think there's an interesting take you're going to have on the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=198.4s)]

*  Hassan. That's how I read it. Bros have decided doing QAnon. Like they're doing, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=222.88s)]
*  unironically they're doing QAnon, but for streaming. At least like your, your MAGA [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  grandparents do QAnon for like consequential things. You know what I mean? Like at least, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=237.76s)]
*  at least people who are doing QAnon account suspended or deactivated. Damn. That's right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=244.64s)]
*  It's because I do have that stronghold on the, on the Twitch sphere. That's right. That's why this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=251.6s)]
*  account was, I forced this account to deactivate because I controlled this platform. I own it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=256.96s)]
*  Anyway, at least QAnon has space lasers. They have so many alts. They just kept adding [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=263.84s)]
*  underscores. What is this guy? I mean, this guy's not all right. It seems anyway. Where were we? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=270.08s)]

*  had issues with Luka. Don Donka's don't just conditioning [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=282.71999999999997s)]

*  dark handed Luka, the torch. Nico blew it out. That's amazing. I mean, dude, it is pretty sad. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=301.52s)]
*  You had a, you had incredible talent. Then you just tossed it aside. They're destroying the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  Luka fat man allegations for why are you sending me the same? I'm literally watching the clip. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=314.32s)]
*  This is the thing that I, I will never understand why chatters do this thing where I'll be literally [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=320.56s)]
*  watching the clip that they send me and they'll be like, yo, yo, can you please watch this video? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=327.28s)]
*  It is funny. It's like, I just watched it anyway. Yeah. Fire, Nico and Miriam. I think Miriam [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=337.44s)]
*  wants the team to go to Vegas and that's why she did this move. Okay. So remember [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=344.16s)]
*  hating Miriam Adelson is good. Okay. Remember a lot of people are hating on Nico, but the real [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=351.36s)]
*  reason you can't make a trade like this without the owner signing off on it. Okay. This is something [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=359.68s)]
*  that Miriam Adelson pushed for in my head. Canon. Okay. Do I have any evidence for it? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=367.52s)]
*  Anybody that criticizes D gets banned off of LSF. Now they're just throwing all plausible [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=373.68s)]
*  deniability away. Yeah. That's not surprising. How can a destiny fan posts with a straight face, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=379.36s)]
*  let alone destiny say it when he's an actual sexual predator who's harassed us on for years. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=385.28s)]
*  Law edit got banned for this law, not beating the allegations of being lackeys for DGG. Yeah, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=390.24s)]
*  they're going, they're going ham on this. They're not even hiding it anymore. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=395.44s)]
*  They're like, Hey, like they posted this video. Ethan Klein reveals the song told him not to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=399.04s)]
*  talk about this. And when they started leftovers, yeah, it wasn't just destiny. There were a couple [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=404.24s)]
*  other people that he wanted to cover all the time as well to like clown on them. Like Nick Fuentes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=408.4s)]
*  And I was like, I don't want to do that. Destiny knows on use destiny to get ahead. Oh my God, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=412.88s)]
*  sex predator or terrorist. Apologies. Both sides are cooked. Yeah, totally. Anyway. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=423.76s)]
*  I can't believe we just started off immediately with LSF. What a, what a silly way to start fun [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=428.64s)]
*  day. We're moving on. We're moving quickly away from that. That wasn't even a secret. You talked [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=432.96s)]
*  about it during leftovers. Yeah, it's not. Why would I like, ironically enough, I was right. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=438.4s)]
*  So I don't know why they thought they could post that and make it seem like [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  it was a, it's something that is favorable. I think a lot of people, a lot of people just like [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=450.0s)]
*  regularly are perma stuck in their echo chambers. So they think like, this is great. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=456.08s)]
*  You're just posting a W man. I don't understand. Yeah. Also I was right. Not only because of like [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=462.32s)]
*  the sex pest and he shit, but I was also right because he did actively harass, uh, Ethan and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=468.0s)]
*  everyone on the crew and actually still does to this day with Ethan. So I don't know. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=475.2s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, just letting you know, it's going to get brigaded by weirdos. And then it did [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=494.08s)]
*  get [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=500.4s)]
*  PSN down. What is your stance? They don't want, uh, they don't want you to play video games on [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  PlayStation. Anyway, my mega Q and on dad who doesn't know I watched you came and asked me [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  about you because he saw the Ethan video. That's so funny. I'm glad that it's getting, uh, it's [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=517.28s)]
*  getting visibility from the best from the funniest circles. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=522.8s)]
*  Um, I think PSN is down because the USA that's what it is. I think USAID was, uh, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=530.88s)]
*  funding PSN specifically because they wanted small boobies in Sony PlayStation games [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  so they could harm gamers. And basically once USAID funding was cut PSN obviously suffered now. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=546.72s)]
*  However, now the, the boobies are going to get bigger in the video game. So that's something to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=556.8s)]
*  look forward to. If that's your cup of tea, why is he not reacting to the wow rate? That is much [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=562.0s)]
*  more important. Um, I don't play well. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=586.8s)]
*  Sony just DMC at 60 FPS bloodborne projects. So the occult, which is her hexing PSN [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4coYFV5H9U&t=589.04s)]
