# Trump Speaks On Combating Anti-Semitism In DC | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48)
*  I feel like when talking about like American talking to American Jews, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=0.0s)]
*  this is your opportunity to win over the American Jewish vote. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=4.04s)]
*  OK, you're talking about Thomas Jefferson like who gives it, dude? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=6.58s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=10.58s)]
*  America great again, we're going to make them both great again, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=17.26s)]
*  greater than ever before. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=19.96s)]
*  We've gathered today to talk about the scourge of anti-Semitism tonight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=21.46s)]
*  We're two weeks away from the one year anniversary of the worst attack [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=27.62s)]
*  on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=30.9s)]
*  Without question, on October 7th, which would have never happened [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=33.74s)]
*  if I was president, by the way, I have to always preface it by saying [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=37.9s)]
*  it would have never, ever happened. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=40.84s)]
*  Innocent men, women, children and babies were tortured, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=44.58s)]
*  maimed, kidnapped, and it was an amazing site, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  especially if you were able to see and you don't want to necessarily see it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Some of the tapes and film that was made of the atrocity. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=56.82s)]
*  Bro City was amazing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=61.78s)]
*  Bro's October 7th was amazing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=63.46s)]
*  Take it that it is a wake up call. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  Get smart. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=67.66s)]
*  Instead, even here in America, Jewish citizens have been forced to endure [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=68.92s)]
*  the worst outbreak of anti-Semitism in many generations. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=73.16s)]
*  And so many people shockingly even deny the attack took place. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=78.38s)]
*  This is a new thing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=81.78s)]
*  I saw it recently where they're interviewing people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  They said, Well, we don't know if there was an attack. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=85.24s)]
*  I don't know. It's just so terrible. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, there were people I read many times. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  I don't think there's a single person who has said October 7 didn't happen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=93.28s)]
*  Either people say it happened and it was good or they say it happened and it was bad. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't think there's a single person that's like October 7 never happened. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=103.38s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about happening right now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  I never thought you'd ever see this ever happen. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=108.32s)]
*  You would. It's beyond. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=111.72s)]
*  It's beyond belief. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  You know, 15 years ago, Israel was the strongest lobby. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=114.72s)]
*  If you want to use the word lobby had the strongest representation of people like this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  These are great people, Miriam. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=123.96s)]
*  People like the strongest. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=125.56s)]
*  There was if you said something about a Jewish person or something about Israel that was bad, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  you were out of politics unless your name was Ted Cruz. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=132.4s)]
*  He could he could get through. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=135.64s)]
*  I think Ted could get through, but maybe not. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=137.54s)]
*  Maybe even Ted. But it's true. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  You said something about Israel that was bad. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=141.8s)]
*  It was like today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=143.68s)]
*  What's crazy is like what he's saying is not even wrong. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=146.14s)]
*  But because he's pro-Israel, he can just say it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=149.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=152.48s)]
*  Don't worry about it. OK. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=153.28s)]
*  Like right there, he's like, oh, back in the day, you can't even say nothing about Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=155.96s)]
*  It's very much like a long time ago when you could say anything, but all across our land, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=160.16s)]
*  Also, why did he call Ted Cruz anti-Semite? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=167.8s)]
*  Or to even protect you with words. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=197.8s)]
*  I'm here today to tell the Jewish American community that this ugly tide of anti-Semitic [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=200.4s)]
*  pro-Mahmoud. He's probably going to drop in Jewish American support after this, by the way, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=206.4s)]
*  which makes this so funny. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=214.36s)]
*  American Jews who care about Israel predominantly have already made up their minds [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=215.84s)]
*  and have been historically Republican Party voters anyway. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  So I don't think he's going to win a single damn American Jewish vote beyond that point. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=223.56s)]
*  It will be a bright new day for the Jewish community in America. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=227.84s)]
*  No longer will you have to walk the streets in fear. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=231.24s)]
*  You're walking the streets in fear. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=234.72s)]
*  Can you believe it? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=236.36s)]
*  Young college students are afraid to go to college. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=237.32s)]
*  It's not something that anybody thought they would ever hear or see. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  No longer will you be threatened on your college campuses. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  No longer will you be against in college admissions and no longer will your own government [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  import jihadists from. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=253.36s)]
*  Trump plus 10 among Jewish voters in New York, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=255.08s)]
*  Percy and a poll. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=257.76s)]
*  No, they want you haters from overseas and they let them come in and resettle in your [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=258.88s)]
*  communities right here at home. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=264.68s)]
*  And nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=266.16s)]
*  My promise to Jewish Americans is this with your vote, I will be your defender, your [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=268.0s)]
*  protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=274.72s)]
*  You know that he had a guy who wore a Vitezi rend. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=280.32s)]
*  Yeah, Jewish voters favorable Carmel hairs over Donald Trump, 60 to 25 percent. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=284.84s)]
*  But also he had a guy who literally not only did he defend Nazis, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  said Jews will not replace us by calling them very fine people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  He literally had a dude who was wearing his father's Hungarian Hitler Division brand. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=297.52s)]
*  You have to do this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=305.88s)]
*  You have to do that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  You don't know what I had to put up with. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=308.12s)]
*  She was like the calming influence. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  I said, Sheldon, I can't do that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=311.64s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=313.64s)]
*  He said, no, no. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  And every time I got something, he'd immediately start with something else. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=315.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  He gets something always fighting for as you on the Jewish people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=319.76s)]
*  But, you know, I had such great respect. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=323.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=325.4s)]
*  He had dinner with Kanye West and Nicholas Fuentes. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=327.08s)]
*  No, we have two admirers of Adolf Hitler. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=329.79999999999995s)]
*  Golan Heights. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=332.76s)]
*  How about Golan Heights? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=333.67999999999995s)]
*  They've been trying to get it for 72 years. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=335.24s)]
*  I got it done in about 15 minutes. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=340.08s)]
*  So even Sheldon couldn't believe that one. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  I'll tell you, even Sheldon couldn't believe that one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=342.84s)]
*  He said, we just got Golan Heights. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  They didn't even ask for it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=346.88s)]
*  I actually gave you that one. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  You didn't ask for it, but I thought it was important. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  Ground zero for the outbreak of the anti-Jewish hate under Kamala Harris has been our college [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=351.76s)]
*  campuses at UCLA. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=356.84s)]
*  A few months ago, Marxist thugs dressed up like and created, quote, Jew exclusion zones, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  blocking Jewish students from entering parts of the campus. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=367.56s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=371.24s)]
*  A week after the October 7th attack, when... [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=372.56s)]
*  So how does the media that hates Donald Trump, but loves defending Israel, cover this? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  Do they just go, he made some very good points on this, very strong points on the issue of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=380.52s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=385.6s)]
*  Is that what they're going to say? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=386.32s)]
*  It's just not even thinkable. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=387.24s)]
*  And the colleges do nothing about it, too. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=389.2s)]
*  Most of them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=391.88s)]
*  At Barrow College, a mob of supporters targeted a group of innocent Jewish freshmen at a [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=393.4s)]
*  welcoming dinner, shouted slurs and mocked them for the death of Jewish hostages in Israel. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=400.32s)]
*  Is there any evidence for the Jew exclusion zones? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=403.84s)]
*  No, there is none. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=406.0s)]
*  At Princeton, you know, activists displayed the as bold as they can, proudly. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=407.28s)]
*  At Columbia, you watch that along with everybody else. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=416.12s)]
*  They took control of the school buildings, these magnificent buildings. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=416.76s)]
*  They beat the hell out of them, by the way. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=420.16s)]
*  And the campus became so dangerous for Jewish students at the university, Rabbi told them, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=422.12s)]
*  please go home, go home. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=427.12s)]
*  A Yale professor called October 7th an extraordinary day. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=428.76000000000005s)]
*  It was a great day, he said. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=433.12s)]
*  A Cornell professor said that these heinous attacks were, quote, exhilarating and energizing [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=435.0s)]
*  to everyone. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=442.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris said that the radical demonstrators on college campuses were, quote, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=443.36s)]
*  Why is Israel not allowed to defend itself? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=449.04s)]
*  Honest question. Great question. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=451.8s)]
*  International law. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=454.24s)]
*  That's it. You can't be a regional power like that and, quote unquote, defend yourself [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=455.44s)]
*  legally under international law against a group of people that you are the belligerent [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=460.64s)]
*  occupier of. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=466.48s)]
*  So it's technically not defense. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  You could say anything is defense, but it's not. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=469.2s)]
*  There is. They're pouring in at levels we've never seen before. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=471.0s)]
*  And she was the border czar. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=474.68s)]
*  She now says she wasn't, but she was still in charge of the border. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=475.88s)]
*  She's the one that did it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=478.52s)]
*  And I will tell you, the message that she gave is wrong. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=480.88s)]
*  It's dangerous and it's unbefitting a candidate for the president of the United States. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=486.08s)]
*  So think of it. Let's assume 350 million. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  We're down to two. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  I told our great first lady the day. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=496.68s)]
*  Well, we're down to two and now we're leading in the polls by I think a lot. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm calling on Kamala Harris to officially disavow the support of all sympathizers, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=504.28s)]
*  anti-Semites, Israel haters on college campuses and everywhere else. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=510.04s)]
*  The saddest part about this is that Kamala Harris will say that and has said that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=515.28s)]
*  Like she will be like she'll totally get into the right wing framing out to be like [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=519.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is right. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=524.36s)]
*  Now, I disavow all of the lovers. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=525.2s)]
*  She's not going to do it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=527.68s)]
*  She's going to talk and talk, talk, talk about not talk about the weather and. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=528.52s)]
*  Sadly, and I have to say this and it hurts me to say it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=533.48s)]
*  You're going to still vote for Democrats and it doesn't make sense. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=537.08s)]
*  I say all the time that any Jewish person that votes for her, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=541.44s)]
*  yeah, especially now her or the Democrat Party should have their head examined. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=546.96s)]
*  And, you know, I just find it so hard to believe. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=554.08s)]
*  And part of it is habit, I guess. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  And respectfully, with all that I've done, I'll maybe go over it quickly, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=560.12s)]
*  but Miriam did it better than I could. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=564.76s)]
*  All the different things with Golan, with all of the things that we did. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=567.08s)]
*  And really, the one thing we didn't mention is I terminated the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=571.76s)]
*  And that is, I think, the biggest of them all. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=576.4s)]
*  But the problem is we could have had a deal, any deal we wanted. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=580.12s)]
*  Michael knows that better than anybody. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=584.52s)]
*  But Biden and Harris, I think what's very funny about this is that, like, one, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=586.8s)]
*  he's just simply complaining about like Jews not voting for him, which is hilarious. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=592.12s)]
*  But also, too, he thinks the only thing that works [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=597.56s)]
*  in terms of like motivating the Jewish American vote is just like Israel. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=601.88s)]
*  And that's just wrong. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  But because the media constantly reiterates this point [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=607.68s)]
*  as though like all Jews universally think that like Israel is the only thing [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=611.16s)]
*  that fucking matters. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=615.88s)]
*  Both parties, both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  operate under this totally false binary, this false notion that like [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=620.56s)]
*  Jews are a monolithic voting block that only cares about Israel. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=625.52s)]
*  So that's the reason why the only thing he's saying to this [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=629.12s)]
*  American Jewish conference is basically, I did Israel for you. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=632.2s)]
*  Come on, I did Israel for you. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=635.92s)]
*  It's like dog. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=637.48s)]
*  What do you mean you did Israel for them? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=639.72s)]
*  They're Jews in America. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=641.32s)]
*  Yeah, there are definitely like, you know, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=642.8s)]
*  Miriam Adelson in the room cares about that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=644.68s)]
*  And the eight other people that are clapping care about that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=646.68s)]
*  But most American Jews are not going to be like, oh, that's my number one thing. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=649.52s)]
*  The anti-Semitism stuff is probably significantly better as a line of attack, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=653.64s)]
*  both against Kamala Harris and also like for Donald Trump to be like, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=658.12s)]
*  oh, anti-Semitism is like rising in America and Kamala Harris is not doing anything about it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=663.3199999999999s)]
*  However, every American Jew remembers [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=667.24s)]
*  what your supporters were saying and doing. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=671.0799999999999s)]
*  So that is going to be very hard for a lot of people to just like overlook. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=674.12s)]
*  Real designers, yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=687.3199999999999s)]
*  It's like old, very wealthy Jewish mega donors to the Republican Party. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=688.92s)]
*  That's the only people he knows. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=693.7199999999999s)]
*  So he thinks like, oh, yeah, all Jews like this, right? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=695.36s)]
*  Come on, Israel, Israel, Israel, Israel. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=697.6s)]
*  They were spray painting at police offices and at the beautiful monuments. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=725.92s)]
*  Have you seen the Daily Beast report that a prominent Jewish family is behind [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=732.16s)]
*  the financial support of the pro-Powsting protests on university campuses? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=735.2s)]
*  I have not. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=738.5600000000001s)]
*  I did not see that, but it's not surprising to me. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=742.24s)]
*  Spray paint, limestone, you'll see it in a hundred years. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=744.16s)]
*  They can take it off, but they can't really take it off. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=747.48s)]
*  You'll see everything that they said in a hundred years. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=749.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a very porous stone and what they've done is unbelievable. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=751.76s)]
*  But I don't see them getting long sentences in prison like happened to other people. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=757.08s)]
*  I don't see them even being approached or attacked in any way. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=762.36s)]
*  They allow them to do it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=766.44s)]
*  But watch those limestones. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=768.0400000000001s)]
*  I looked at them the other day and that stone just it just sucks up that paint. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=770.1600000000001s)]
*  It goes deep. You're going to see it in a hundred years from now. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris, let them go. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=780.36s)]
*  She said, let them go. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=783.16s)]
*  I will end this political harassment once and for all. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=784.76s)]
*  You know, when I was president, we had a moment where Washington was [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=787.56s)]
*  in a sense being attacked. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=793.9599999999999s)]
*  They were trying to pull down statues and I pulled out an old [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=795.52s)]
*  about an 1897 statute. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=799.16s)]
*  You shouldn't remind. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=802.64s)]
*  It said that anybody touching. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=803.76s)]
*  He shouldn't remind Americans the last time he defended [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=806.4399999999999s)]
*  people who were protesting a statue being taken down, you know, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=809.9599999999999s)]
*  when they were saying Jews will not replace us at Charlottesville. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=813.16s)]
*  You serve three days. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=816.52s)]
*  It's 10 years and you serve all 10 years. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=818.56s)]
*  You couldn't get a thing like that passed today. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=820.48s)]
*  I don't think what do you think that not to not to easily. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=822.28s)]
*  If you got if you got two days, it would be a miracle. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=826.04s)]
*  Now it's 10 years. It was sold. I lifted up this. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=828.72s)]
*  It was old and dusty, but it read beautifully. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=831.12s)]
*  And I invoked it and I had a speech. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=834.48s)]
*  I said, here's the story. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=837.08s)]
*  Anybody touching a statue and it ended when they had Abraham Lincoln [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=838.76s)]
*  ready to be pulled over. You remember that? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=843.52s)]
*  They said, Abraham Lincoln. Now we're hitting Lincoln. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=845.76s)]
*  And I read it and I told people that anybody from this moment on [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=848.72s)]
*  that pulls down anything or even tries to pull down a statue. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=854.2s)]
*  You go into jail for 10 years. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=858.48s)]
*  It was an amazing sight, Miriam. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=860.4s)]
*  Everybody just dropped the ropes. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=863.0799999999999s)]
*  It's so funny that he keeps calling out Miriam Adelson by name. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=865.4s)]
*  They started walking out of town. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=868.8s)]
*  How many people are in that room of asses from the back? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=870.28s)]
*  It was a beautiful sight. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  It was a beautiful sight. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=875.9599999999999s)]
*  There was a beautiful side. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=877.52s)]
*  A little bit more. They just started walking. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=878.7199999999999s)]
*  And that was the last of the problem we had. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=881.3199999999999s)]
*  Remember the big problems we're having? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=883.16s)]
*  They actually wanted to rip down Thomas Jefferson Memorial. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=885.24s)]
*  They didn't like Jefferson. They didn't like Washington. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=888.8399999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about, dude? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=890.8399999999999s)]
*  These are all things. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=893.64s)]
*  Dude, come on. Come on. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=895.8399999999999s)]
*  I already brought this up, but obviously American Jews don't only care about Israel [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=898.28s)]
*  and don't care about Israel all that much, with the exception of the freaks, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=903.28s)]
*  like Miriam Adelson, right? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=906.4s)]
*  But beyond that, I feel like when talking about American Jews, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=908.56s)]
*  this is your opportunity to win over the American Jewish vote, OK? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=913.36s)]
*  You're talking about Thomas Jefferson. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=916.8s)]
*  Like, who gives it, dude? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=918.1999999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=919.92s)]
*  But open to she's supported unlimited migration from hotbeds into the United States, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=921.84s)]
*  especially some of the hotbeds that most hate Israel under Bordesor, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=927.84s)]
*  Harris, armies of foreign sympathizers now march brazenly through our cities. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=933.6s)]
*  They're they're literally marching in our cities. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=939.88s)]
*  And they are a single issue voter. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=942.6s)]
*  And my issue is statute preservation. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  Very vicious parts of the world. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=947.12s)]
*  And they do not like Jewish people and they do not like Israel. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=949.52s)]
*  And they've let that be known. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=953.76s)]
*  And we are not going to tell. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=955.2s)]
*  That's awesome. I will not let what happened to Paris, what happened to London. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=957.64s)]
*  That's amazing. He's saying he's saying anti-Semitism is on the rise [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=961.96s)]
*  also because of migrants happen here in America. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=966.28s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=968.76s)]
*  We will deport the foreign Jihad sympathizers and supporters from our midst. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=970.2s)]
*  We will get them out of our country. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=975.64s)]

*  Who do you think has a, you know, who do you think has a firm opinion on Jewish people, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=988.36s)]
*  the Haitian migrants that are living in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=996.0400000000001s)]
*  or the literal neo-Nazi movement that is marching against them? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1000.84s)]
*  I wonder who out of those two groups openly and actively hates Jews. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1005.0s)]
*  Like we're not even talking about Israel. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1011.56s)]
*  We're just straight up talking about Jews. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1012.92s)]
*  OK, I wonder who I wonder who actually is increasing anti-Semitism in America. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1014.92s)]
*  The newcomer migrants or the neo-Nazis that want to purge them [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1024.2s)]
*  and also claim Jews are bringing them into the United States of America. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1029.72s)]
*  Temporary 10% cap on credit card interest rates because they're paying 20 and 25 percent [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1035.0s)]
*  and they're getting decimated. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1040.12s)]
*  So it'll be a temporary 10% cap. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1042.12s)]
*  But look, this is the most important election in the history of the United States. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1045.4s)]
*  And it's also the most important election in the history of Israel. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1049.4s)]
*  The United States election is the most important election in the history of Israel. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1053.8s)]
*  Actually, if you think about it, how crazy does that sound? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1059.4s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1061.88s)]
*  With all I've done for Israel, I received only 24 percent of the Jews. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1063.16s)]
*  I love listening to like pro-Israel people, yep, because they're just so transparent. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1066.28s)]
*  They're so radically honest. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1071.4s)]
*  That's the story of my life. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1072.92s)]
*  They're so radically honest. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1074.52s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1075.8s)]
*  But I understood that because I wasn't really tested. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1076.6s)]
*  I wasn't a politician and I won. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1080.52s)]
*  But I understood that. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1083.96s)]
*  And then I became president and was the best president ever for the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1086.36s)]
*  people of Israel and for Jewish people, the best president ever. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1091.5600000000002s)]
*  Wait, Mary Miller is there? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1095.88s)]
*  I did more for them than any president has and probably any president [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1097.96s)]
*  can do or will do other than the current. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1102.8400000000001s)]
*  Mary Miller is at the event. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1105.48s)]
*  It's got to be a different one, right? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1107.16s)]
*  We're still going to know if we win a few elections, we're still going to be losing [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1108.28s)]
*  unless we win the hearts and minds of our children. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1113.3200000000002s)]
*  This is the battle. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1117.0800000000002s)]
*  Hitler was right on one thing. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1119.0s)]
*  He said whoever has the youth has the future. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1121.48s)]
*  Our children are being propagandized. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1125.24s)]
*  Bro, bro, what the fuck? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1128.52s)]
*  He brought the Hitler lady. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1132.1200000000001s)]
*  That's got to be that's got to be like a flex, right? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1134.04s)]
*  Like he's just like, listen, these are my favorite. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1136.68s)]
*  Here are some of my favorite anti-Semites. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1140.28s)]
*  But they would have had every single prize ever devised by man. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1142.3600000000001s)]
*  I did it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1146.52s)]
*  Nobody nobody said a thing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1147.0s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1148.92s)]
*  I do the right thing. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1149.96s)]
*  And I was helped a lot by Jared and a lot of other people that really understood what [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1151.48s)]
*  was going on. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1155.96s)]
*  But I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the embassy in Jerusalem and got it [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1156.68s)]
*  built, not just had it there. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1161.96s)]
*  You know, the the generals came in. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1164.44s)]
*  I'm new to the political commentary sphere. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1167.16s)]
*  Is it bad to have the Hitler lady at the combatting anti-Semitism event? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1168.76s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1171.48s)]
*  Do you want to know why it doesn't matter? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1172.36s)]
*  Because as long as someone is a Zionist, it doesn't matter if they love Hitler, if they [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1173.8s)]
*  openly support Hitler, if they adore Hitler. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1178.28s)]
*  OK, I cannot be more honest about this with you. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1181.24s)]
*  OK, the American media, because it's no, I know you're making a joke, by the way. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1184.9199999999998s)]
*  Obviously, you're making a joke, but I'm being serious. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1190.52s)]
*  OK, I will give you an example. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1193.3999999999999s)]
*  CNN, Van Jones, all these losers constantly talk about anti-Semitism on college campuses [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1195.6399999999999s)]
*  in an effort to put on a lot of these movements that college students participated in, many [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1201.16s)]
*  of them led and organized by Jewish students, Jewish anti-Zionist students. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1206.68s)]
*  They just cry about how anti-Semitic those students are for saying Israel is mean and [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1210.8400000000001s)]
*  bad and doing right, which is true. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1214.8400000000001s)]
*  Van Jones literally stood on the pro-Israel rally stage and spoke alongside like a former, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1217.16s)]
*  I mean, former and current American Republicans, American Democrats, and Pastor John Hagee, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1226.68s)]
*  who said Hitler was a Jew. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1232.8400000000001s)]
*  And it's good that the Holocaust happened because that way Israel was formed. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1234.92s)]
*  OK, like these guys do not give a about anti-Semitism. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1241.4s)]
*  I cannot stress this enough. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1245.0800000000002s)]
*  As a matter of fact, they literally also participate in anti-Semitism when they routinely [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1246.92s)]
*  that all American Jews and all Jews around the world only care about Israel. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1253.24s)]
*  There's nothing else. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1257.8s)]
*  Just Israel. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1258.52s)]
*  Nothing else. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1259.24s)]
*  You cannot shake them from this position. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1259.8s)]
*  And that everything that Israel does is done at the behest of the global Jewish population. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1261.5600000000002s)]
*  That is inherently anti-Semitic. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1267.16s)]
*  That's literally what Nazis say. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1268.8400000000001s)]
*  OK, but when someone is pro-Israel and saying that, it doesn't fucking matter if they're a Nazi or not. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1271.3200000000002s)]
*  Then they'd spend five billion and it would look like hell. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1283.64s)]
*  This building is better. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1286.6000000000001s)]
*  You'll never do better. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1287.72s)]
*  Someday they'll rip it down and do some monster. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1288.68s)]
*  But I was very proud we got it built. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1291.4s)]
*  And most importantly of all, in my opinion, because I asked, what's the best? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1293.8s)]
*  Golan Heights, is it? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1299.96s)]
*  Is it Jerusalem, the capital, moving the embassy and all of that? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1301.3200000000002s)]
*  What is the best? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1305.48s)]
*  What's the best? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1306.3600000000001s)]
*  Is it the Abraham Accords and some friends of mine that are very smart? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1307.0s)]
*  No, no, not even close. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1309.88s)]
*  The best thing you ever did for Israel is you terminated the Iran nuclear deal, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1312.04s)]
*  which was the worst deal ever made for Israel or for any country. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1316.6799999999998s)]
*  That was the best. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1323.32s)]
*  That's true. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1324.12s)]
*  That was more important. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1325.48s)]
*  Remember, that was more important than that was more important than any of the other things, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1327.24s)]
*  of the many other things that we did. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1331.72s)]
*  The problem is that Harris, Kamala and Biden did absolutely nothing with it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1334.12s)]
*  It's kind of crazy when you think about it, but like he has more [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1340.4399999999998s)]
*  Hassan, your Muslim opinion never matters. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1344.84s)]

*  Oh, anyway, as I was saying, I think was the lowest day, the most embarrassing day in the [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1367.32s)]
*  history of our country was the deal with Iran nuclear deal, Iran denuclearization agreement, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1376.6799999999998s)]
*  which was probably one of the most pivotal foreign policy accomplishments of the Obama [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1381.32s)]
*  administration was a step towards normalizing American relations with Iran. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1385.6399999999999s)]
*  And obviously Israel hated that and did not want that to happen. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1393.1599999999999s)]
*  It's one of the major reasons beyond the fact that Obama is also a black Kenyan Muslim man [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1398.28s)]
*  that caused a lot of people to hate Obama and call him a Jew hater. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1405.08s)]
*  Now, I will say places like Miami and different places were great. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1413.32s)]
*  I went from hold on, let's just hear this and I'll get back to it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1420.36s)]

*  He's talking about Jewish people again. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1435.4799999999998s)]
*  Jewish, but let me give you the bad news. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1436.9199999999998s)]
*  A poll. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1438.76s)]

*  I've done so much for you. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1445.88s)]
*  Come on, Jews, why won't you vote for me? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1447.0s)]
*  I'm doing the thing you want. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1460.8400000000001s)]
*  You can't let this happen. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1474.5200000000002s)]
*  40% is not acceptable because we have an election to win. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1477.16s)]
*  So after all of this, I went from 29 to 40%. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1481.3200000000002s)]
*  And people that are smart said to me, friend of mine Jewish, friend of mine loves Israel, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1485.0s)]
*  loves everything about your religion and about your country, your place. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1490.3600000000001s)]

*  It's sad. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1499.0s)]
*  And he started to cry. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1499.4s)]
*  Actually, he started to cry with all of this. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1500.6000000000001s)]
*  He's a tough cookie. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1503.48s)]
*  I don't think he cried for since he was a little tiny baby. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1504.28s)]
*  Maybe then I don't think he cried. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1506.92s)]
*  I don't think he cried then Miriam, but I will put it to you very simply and gently. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1509.16s)]
*  I really haven't been treated right, but you haven't been treated right because you're [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1516.6s)]

*  They'll never change because they have a section of their party now which has become amazingly [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1563.56s)]
*  and quickly very powerful, vote wise. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1567.72s)]

*  But it's time that you fight the real fight. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1786.2s)]
*  And the real fight is to save Israel. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1788.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1789.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1790.84s)]
*  That's the real fight. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1791.64s)]
*  That's the only fight that matters. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1792.68s)]
*  So the point I wanted to make, there she is, Mary Maddelson. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1794.68s)]
*  So one thing that is actually pretty interesting [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1801.08s)]
*  is that Trump did actually do a lot for Israel, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1804.2s)]
*  obviously didn't do for American Jews. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1809.4s)]
*  And actually the stuff that he did for American Jews [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1811.72s)]
*  was just objectively awful, as is the case [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1815.8s)]
*  for every other subsect of American society. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1818.76s)]
*  But specifically in terms of rising anti-Semitism [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1823.88s)]
*  in the country, he played a big role in that. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1827.0s)]
*  Obviously the synagogue shooting happened under his watch. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1829.64s)]
*  One of his supporters who outflanked him later down the line [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1833.48s)]
*  turned around and shot up a synagogue [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1837.48s)]
*  while channeling his arguments saying that Jews are doing [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1840.6000000000001s)]
*  unrestricted immigration and Jews are responsible [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1845.08s)]
*  for like the caravans. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1848.68s)]
*  But beyond that, one thing that is actually really interesting [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1850.1200000000001s)]
*  is he has done a lot of things for Israel specifically. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1854.2s)]
*  Trump is oftentimes policy free. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1860.28s)]
*  He doesn't have a lot to point to in terms of like [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1862.92s)]
*  his policy accomplishments. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1865.24s)]
*  He also doesn't really have any interest. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1867.08s)]
*  In talking about policy in general. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1869.72s)]
*  But one thing I have noticed as a massive Trump stan [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1873.4s)]
*  who watches all of his speeches is that this conversation [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1876.3600000000001s)]
*  that he had actually had a lot of policy. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1881.08s)]
*  Problem is that policy wasn't for American people. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1884.2s)]
*  It wasn't for American Jews. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1887.16s)]
*  It was just simply for Israel, the Abraham Accords, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1888.92s)]
*  casting aside the Iran denuclearization agreement, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1892.04s)]
*  adding additional sanctions to Iran. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1895.32s)]
*  The fact that he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1898.04s)]
*  recognizing Jerusalem as like the Israeli capital, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1900.9199999999998s)]
*  giving Israel Golan Heights. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1903.8s)]
*  All of these things, all of these things are actually [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1905.96s)]
*  direct policy accomplishments, but for Israel. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1911.1599999999999s)]
*  And what's really interesting about that is like [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1915.08s)]
*  you never actually see him talk about policy this directly [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1917.08s)]
*  with the exception of when he's talking about how pro-Israel [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1921.24s)]
*  he is, something to consider. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1924.36s)]
*  Anyway, now Mamala is live with Oprah. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1926.1999999999998s)]
*  She's going live right now with Oprah. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgSgpvEe48&t=1928.4399999999998s)]
