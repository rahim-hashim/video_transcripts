# Trump Is Distracting The American People | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo)
*  All these ugly b****es sitting behind Donald Trump! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=0.0s)]
*  Who the f*** do you think is gonna get [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  CLOCKED, quote unquote, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=5.16s)]
*  when everyone is suspected of being trans? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=7.16s)]
*  I hate this shit. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=9.6s)]
*  It's like Ben Shapiro talking about how masculine he is. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  No, dog. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=13.88s)]
*  No. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=14.88s)]
*  You're gonna get transvestigated, Ben. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=15.68s)]
*  Is it Ben or is it Jen? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=18.68s)]
*  I don't know what we're doing here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  You can't abide by this rigid binary [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=21.32s)]
*  that doesn't exist when it comes to gender. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=25.0s)]
*  Trump is live right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=31.0s)]
*  Executive orders to ban men from competing in women's sports. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=33.0s)]
*  It's about time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=37.0s)]
*  Under the Trump administration, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=52.0s)]
*  we will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=54.0s)]
*  and we will not allow men to b**** up, injure, and cheat. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=58.0s)]
*  Our women and our girls. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=62.0s)]
*  From now on, women's sports will be only for women. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=64.0s)]
*  But before going further, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=76.0s)]
*  I want to share some very exciting news from our military. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=78.0s)]
*  After years of shrinking force numbers at levels [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=82.0s)]
*  that nobody has ever seen before, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=86.0s)]
*  four years of this we went through, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=88.0s)]
*  and missed recruiting targets every single month, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=90.0s)]
*  it was just announced that in December [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=94.0s)]
*  the U.S. Army had its single best recruitment [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=96.0s)]
*  in more than 15 years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=99.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=101.0s)]
*  Every single day, nearly 350 new soldiers enlisted [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=107.0s)]
*  to defend our nation, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=111.0s)]
*  and they're very, very happy to have done so. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=113.0s)]
*  We've done lots of interviews, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=116.0s)]
*  and we asked why this was taking place now, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=118.0s)]
*  and they just said there's a spirit about our country [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=121.0s)]
*  that they haven't seen in many, many years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=124.0s)]
*  And I happen to agree with that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=126.0s)]
*  But it really is clear proof that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=132.0s)]
*  this spirit is sweeping our armed forces, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=134.0s)]
*  and we have a great leader in P.E.A.T., as you know. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=137.0s)]
*  We know him so well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=142.0s)]
*  He's going to be fantastic, and so many of our great heroes [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=144.0s)]
*  and people are starting to understand [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=147.0s)]
*  what hero is all about. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=149.0s)]
*  So that is something that is very important. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=151.0s)]
*  We've gotten the woke lunacy out of our military. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=154.0s)]
*  And now we're very importantly getting it out of women's sports. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=161.0s)]
*  That's taking place very strongly. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=166.0s)]
*  So in recent years, the radical left has waged an all-out campaign [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=168.0s)]
*  to erase the very concept of biological sex [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=172.0s)]
*  and replace it with a militant transgender ideology. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=175.0s)]
*  You heard a little bit about this, haven't you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=179.0s)]
*  Just a little bit? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=181.0s)]
*  Does anybody agree with them? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=183.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=185.0s)]
*  It would be not a good thing to say yes right here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=186.0s)]
*  Female athletes have been forced onto the front lines, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=189.0s)]
*  and men, clad in white, are forced to wear a mask [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=193.0s)]
*  and men claiming to be girls have stolen more than 3,500 victories. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=197.0s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=202.0s)]
*  And invaded more than 11,000 competitions designed for women. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=203.0s)]
*  Last year, a male cyclist posing as a woman [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=207.0s)]
*  competed in the 800-mile Arizona Trail Race, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=211.0s)]
*  a very big deal in cycling, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=215.0s)]
*  and obliterated the woman's course record by nearly five and a half hours. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=218.0s)]
*  Sounds like a lot, doesn't it, huh? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=223.0s)]
*  Five and a half hours, but you have to hear the weightlifting records, Afe. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=226.0s)]
*  You think that's bad, the weightlifting's worse. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=230.0s)]
*  In 2023, a man in women's powerlifting broke two world records [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=234.0s)]
*  and outlifted his closest female opponent in one event by 440 pounds. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=240.0s)]
*  And they continue to defend themselves, Mr. Congressman. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=249.0s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=253.0s)]
*  They continue to defend themselves. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=254.0s)]
*  We hope they continue onward because I don't think we can lose a race. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=256.0s)]
*  This was one of the big reasons that we all won, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=261.0s)]
*  and it's one of the big reasons that we had a record, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=263.0s)]
*  a landslide like they haven't seen before very often anyway. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=266.0s)]
*  And who could forget last year's Paris Olympics [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=271.0s)]
*  where a male boxer stole the woman's gold medal after bra-dizing his female opponent [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=274.0s)]
*  so viciously that she had to forfeit just after 46 seconds, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=279.0s)]
*  and she was a championship fighter. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=284.0s)]
*  And actually, they had two women or two people that transitioned, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=286.0s)]
*  and both of them won gold medals, and they won them very convincingly. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=290.0s)]
*  But all of that ends today because with this executive order, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=295.0s)]
*  the war on women's sports is over. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=299.0s)]
*  Also, I'm live. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=309.0s)]
*  Thank you, everybody. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=317.0s)]
*  Crash out titled, Dear Hassan Piker, what? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=327.0s)]
*  I'm done, man. I'm done. I'm done. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=331.0s)]
*  I don't care about the women. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=334.0s)]
*  I'm done, man. I'm done. I'm done. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=336.0s)]
*  I don't care about crash outs. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=338.0s)]
*  I don't care about your favorite content creator saying I'm anti-Semitic [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=339.0s)]
*  and begging for people in positions of power to ban me. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=343.0s)]
*  Okay. Calling the fucking manager. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=347.0s)]
*  I just want to live in Japan. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=349.0s)]
*  I'm just going to quit my fucking job. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=351.0s)]
*  I'm going to quit my job, except I'm not going to quit my job [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=353.0s)]
*  because that's, that would make some of the worst dumbasses so fucking happy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=356.0s)]
*  All right. Let's get back to this awful reality of Donald Trump. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=362.0s)]
*  Writing yet another executive order specifically designed to shit on 0.1% of the population. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=365.0s)]
*  Not even 0.1. It's just like the smallest, smallest subsect of the population, specifically being cruel [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=374.0s)]
*  for no reason other than the fact that, you know, it's a great distraction for a bunch of dumbass Americans. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=381.0s)]
*  I want to thank so many people that have worked so hard in the political establishment [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=389.0s)]
*  and they're before me largely. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=394.0s)]
*  And I'm going to, I think I'm going to miss a few. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=396.0s)]
*  It always happens when you do this, but it's just one of those things. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=398.0s)]
*  But we have many senators here, many governors here, many state attorneys, general, generals here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=402.0s)]
*  They're all over the place, actually. I see. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=409.0s)]
*  Some of them went after me, but they failed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=412.0s)]
*  And they're really friends and they're friends of women's sports, that I can tell you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=419.0s)]
*  So Senator Marsha Blackburn. Where's Marsha? Hi. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=430.0s)]
*  Senator Katie Britt. Thank you, Katie. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=438.0s)]
*  Are trans people allowed in Japan? I don't think they give a shit. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=442.0s)]
*  Where's Mike? Mike. I love his new haircut. I love that haircut. Mike. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=445.0s)]
*  Japanese people don't give a shit about trans people, except it doesn't matter because the reality is, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=452.0s)]
*  as I was talking to with the Japanese communist party, if you recall on their stream, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=461.0s)]
*  whatever is popping off here in the United States of America turns into a major issue later down the line. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=465.0s)]
*  Asmongold thinks this is amazing. This is what I mean. This is what I mean. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=474.0s)]
*  This is who this bell is for. Asmongold, a person who doesn't leave his house, who does not give a shit, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=478.0s)]
*  who's never going to encounter a trans person. Okay. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=484.0s)]
*  Like what the fuck? It's just a messaging bill. It's not that big. It's not. It's not. It's nothing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=489.0s)]
*  It's nothing. It's a distraction. It's a distraction. It's a distraction. People don't understand it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=496.0s)]
*  They think this is like, Oh my God, incredible legislative. What an incredible legislative agenda. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=500.0s)]
*  This is for people and not as mingle because he's rich, but this is for people who watch as mingle whose lives are shit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=507.0s)]
*  Okay. They're poor as fuck. They hate their fucking jobs and they are desperately looking for a reason as to why everything sucks. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=515.0s)]
*  Otherwise they're going to fucking kill themselves. Okay. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=523.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump extends a lifeline to these dip. It's okay. He tells them, you know, why should not because you're fucking boss, not because of your dumb ass job, not because of how awful everything is. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=527.0s)]
*  Okay. Not because of how unaffordable things are. Everything's because there are 19 trans athletes in the entire nation. Okay. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=540.0s)]
*  And this is all done to serve this distraction, to serve this purpose of distraction. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=558.0s)]
*  But there are still thousands of people that will be harmed in this process, not because they can't enjoy high school athletics or whatever. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=568.0s)]
*  Okay. But because this agenda is, is straight up seeking out random people who are not harming anybody. Okay. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=578.0s)]
*  At the behest of making people like this happy 19 mentally ill man, pretending to be a woman. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=589.0s)]
*  They're like, you don't understand it. And that's fine. Okay. Here's where I draw the line though. You don't understand it, but then you make it everybody else's problem. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=595.0s)]
*  And it's so funny because like, it just sucks. This administration sucks in very meaningful ways and in very glaringly obvious ways as well. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=606.0s)]
*  And seemingly don't know one is tasked or interested in actually fighting back against it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=623.0s)]
*  And the most pathetic fucking losers, the most pathetic losers who have absolutely nothing in their lives, get great pleasure out of this kind of domination because weak people love when other volatiles are [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=632.0s)]
*  vulnerable. People even more vulnerable, more marginalized people get dunked on. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=652.0s)]
*  It makes them feel strong. Weak people feel strong when the systems are dominating others. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=657.0s)]
*  That's it. I will never understand it. It is not something that I comprehend. It is not something that I, it's not something that I can understand. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=669.0s)]
*  Like celebrating a move like this is so fucking stupid. And before everybody does the 7 million fucking think pieces about biological males and high school sports is devastating us on. Once again, there's like 10 of them, man. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=679.0s)]
*  Having this much conversation around 10 fucking people, you think it's you, do you really think it's that pressing of an issue or do you think they're just using this to, you know, change your focus a little bit. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=694.0s)]
*  You're an absolute fucking moron. Okay. An absolute moron. There are more Congress persons that vote on bills like this. Okay. Then there are trans athletes. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=710.0s)]
*  Like they don't touch your shit at all. They're not a part of your life. They're not, they're not ruining your life. They're not doing anything. You know, they're not doing anything. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=730.0s)]
*  And because we are a bunch of weak willed men, because we're a bunch of fucking weak men, we love the prospect of dominating those who are less fortunate than we are. Okay. That's all we got. That's all we got in our hearts is hatred. Okay. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=752.0s)]
*  Hatred born out of our own vulnerabilities, our own weaknesses. We're so fucking sad and pathetic. We recognize this shit sucks and we don't have any solutions for it. So we just sit around and cross our fingers and hope that the God King, Donald Trump dominates our enemies. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=775.0s)]
*  You know, enemies that we've imagined. So fucking stupid. Meanwhile, you know, who also gets fucked over in this anti trans nonsense. All these ugly bitches sitting behind Donald Trump. Who the fuck do you think is going to get fucking [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=794.0s)]
*  co-op, quote unquote, when everyone is suspected of being fucking trans. I hate this shit. It's like Ben Shapiro talking about how fucking masculine he is. No dog. No, you're going to get transvestigated. Ben, is it Ben or is it Jen? I don't know what we're doing here. You can't fuck with me. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=812.0s)]
*  I hate this shit. It's like Ben Shapiro talking about how fucking masculine he is. No dog. No, you're going to get transvestigated. Ben, is it Ben or is it Jen? I don't know what we're doing here. You can't fucking abide by this rigid binary that doesn't fucking exist when it comes to gender. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=828.0s)]
*  Anyway, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. That was actually very misogynistic of me. I should have used better language instead of saying these ugly bitches. I should have said a lot of turfs are incredibly clucky because it's true. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=847.0s)]
*  And they weirdly think, they weirdly think like, Oh no, I'm cis. If we eradicate all trans people, no one will suspect me of being trans ever again. And it's like, no, they won't because it has nothing to do with this designation. Okay. And it has everything to do with misogyny. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=866.0s)]
*  But you're too fucking stupid to understand that. Okay. Not because you're a woman, just because you're a Republican, just so you understand you're too stupid to understand that this has nothing to do with like hating trans people in particular. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=885.0s)]
*  A lot of the anti-trans rhetoric and anti-trans sentiment revolves around misogyny still. Yeah. So have fun. You can have penis inspection day for your daughters now. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=897.0s)]
*  Next time you got a dominant athlete in the family, the fathers from the next town over can come over and say, your daughter's got a fucking dick dog. And guess what? In a state like Kansas or Ohio, they can make some sort of legal enforcement surrounding that sort of thing. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=912.0s)]
*  So now you can have the pedophile PE teacher, the pedophile gym teacher, check your daughter's pussy sick. Who the fuck do you think gets harmed in that situation? Okay. It's called penis inspection day. Who do you think gets harmed in that situation? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=928.0s)]
*  The 19 trans athletes or the tens of thousands, if not millions of cis girls that are participating in athletic endeavors. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=944.0s)]
*  My point is anti-trans shit is completely unnecessary. Greatly overemphasized. People make it seem as though it's the most pressing issue on the fucking planet when it's not. And then they don't, they don't realize that like the mechanisms of enforcement are unnecessarily [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=957.0s)]
*  restrictive for all people. And considering that there are statistically less trans people, then yeah, you're most likely going to end up harming a bunch of cis women in the process of enforcement. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=985.0s)]
*  Same process. What have you ever considered going back in the closet is what one chatter asked me the closet for what? Oh, have, oh, have genuinely considered going back in the closet. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1001.0s)]
*  Is getting too scary. What is it called? Boy moaning. I misunderstood. No chatter was saying that about themselves. I'm sorry, dude or lady or the emperor. Listen, I don't know. I don't know what's happening. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1025.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know how to fix it. I just, I don't know. We just got to take care of each other. But anyway, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1046.0s)]
*  Look, there's still motherfuckers talking about. Oh my Lord. There's still motherfuckers talking about like matchups and sports, brother. They are going to. I don't want to say anything. I'm not. I'm done. I'm done. Nobody gives a fuck about fairness. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1077.0s)]
*  Nobody cares about fucking sports. Shut the fuck up. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1092.0s)]
*  It's just the way to offer permission structure to shit on trans people. That's it, dude. That's it. That's it. It's it. It's fucking irrelevant. Okay. It is fucking irrelevant. It is utterly irrelevant. Trans people do not exist in the field of sports, let alone exist as a domineering force. You are fucking mentally deficient. If you think this is a real issue. I have lost my fucking mind at this point after literally almost a decade of Joe Rogan infused. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1095.0s)]
*  Conversations greatly over emphasizing the magical mystical deities that are trans athletes, trans women athletes specifically. Holy fuck, dude. People unironically sit around and assume that trans people are just like the most dominant forces. And yet they just get owned all the fucking time. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1117.0s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. And I've been fucking pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years. I've been pushing it for years.

*  This is a complete waste of government resource. Such a major issue. Debbie. I think Debbie's [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1187.0s)]

*  and don't even read context here. How can you have a conversation? Law? I don't know, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1205.68s)]
*  man. I don't know. Not every space is going to be good for you. Okay. I'm sorry that it's [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1210.36s)]
*  not designed to your perfect expectations. All right. Doing a fantastic job. Oh yeah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1215.08s)]
*  That's a great point to trans people dominate in the field of sports, but they suck at being [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1224.6s)]
*  troops. They must be, they must not work. They must not work in the military because [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1229.24s)]
*  they're the world of all time. And at a certain point you have to realize they're just saying [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1234.96s)]
*  they want to fucking kill trans people. Okay. They want to forcibly de-transition trans [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1239.12s)]
*  people and maybe perhaps kill them. Okay. Or, you know, have them kill themselves in [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1242.84s)]
*  the process. That's it. That's the fucking goal. The goal is to stop trans people from [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1249.4399999999998s)]
*  existing. Now it doesn't matter if you don't understand it. Okay. It doesn't matter if [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1253.6799999999998s)]
*  you don't know a single trans person that you care about. Mind your fucking business. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1259.48s)]
*  Do you see what I'm saying? Like why the fuck would this ever be a pressing issue in your [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1265.12s)]
*  mind? Why would this ever be top of mind? Why would this ever be something that you [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1270.52s)]
*  care about? Okay. This is an issue entirely dedicated to trans people. They care about [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1275.04s)]
*  this issue because this is about destroying them. Okay. This is about killing them. And [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1283.12s)]
*  also this is an issue dedicated entirely to the likes of the hyper fixated transphobic [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1288.68s)]
*  weirdos. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1294.82s)]
*  But it doesn't make sense on the one hand, trans people are incredibly dominant athletes [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1305.3799999999999s)]
*  in sports and they're fucking owning and they're killing everybody out there. And on the other [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1309.86s)]

*  big one. But in Los Angeles in 2028, my administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1332.46s)]

*  do with the price of eggs? Okay. What does this got to do with fixing the price of eggs? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0UuoZrzvqo&t=1360.74s)]
