# Joe Rogan Hates Canada | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg)
*  Rogan wanted to perform his comedy here in Vancouver during COVID, but the venue wouldn't let him do it unvaccinated. We've been commies ever since. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=7.2s)]
*  To be fair, I would use that as a reason to not let Rogan in as well. If I had the opportunity, I'd be like, sorry. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=8.8s)]
*  Next week, everyone is unvaccinated, but just Joe Rogan is like, oh, sorry, this week, we just are not letting any unvaccinated comedians in. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=14.92s)]
*  Joe Rogan. I won't be at UFC three 15. I don't go to Canada anymore. I'd rather go to Russia, bro. That is what first of all, first of all, why is he giving a gift to Canadians? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=22.6s)]
*  If you don't with Canada, you not going inside of the Canadian border is only a gift to Canada. He's like, he's like, yeah, oh, I bet Canadians will hate that my dumb ass won't be there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Okay. Oh, you'll miss me. Oh, you'll miss me when I'm gone. Oh, no. Poor Canadians. No, man. Go there and stay there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=60.2s)]
*  Okay. Canadians keep sending their worst down here. We might as well do the same in return. Go talk about Canadian politics up there. Come on. Why is it that this is only a one way street? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=68.6s)]
*  We're only can only the worst Canadians come down here and stay down here. Okay. Most non right wing Jerry take is so funny. I'd rather go to Russia. I don't go to Canada anymore. Canada. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=82.24s)]
*  Canada is an authoritarian dictatorship. Canada is a woke authoritarian dictatorship, which is why I want to go to Russia. A truly free country. You know what I mean? A country that's actually free. What the fuck is Canada done? The Rogan. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  I don't even know that I'd like. Why do do why do conservatives hate Canada now? Is it because of woke? Is that what it is? What's the deal? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  It's because Justin Trudeau didn't do enough blackface or something. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=123.6s)]
*  Like what? Oh, they booed the national anthem. Yeah. Okay. Here's my solution to that. Don't do awful shit. So that our allies in the north. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=131.04s)]
*  Don't fucking despise us. Very simple solution. Hey, perhaps. Hey Americans, have you thought about not entertaining the military annexation of a foreign ally? Our neighboring state of Canada. If you don't want them to boo at our national anthem. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=143.52s)]
*  That's also such a funny thing to just like get upset about. Like, oh no, Canadians booed our national anthem. Oh no. Meanwhile, I urge Canadians not to come down here, especially ones that are in my chat, because they will be going through your DMs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=165.96s)]
*  Probably looking at your watch time on the Hassan Abiy broadcast and making an assessment on whether or not they will let you into the country or if they will potentially keep you in a permanent detention facility for an extended period of time for the crime of hurting Israel's feelings. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=182.2s)]
*  Canada is one of Canada is not alone in issuing travel advisory warnings to the United States of America. Many other countries have issued similar travel advisory warnings because that's what we do now. That's what we do now, baby. That's what we do. You come in here. Oh, you want to go to Disneyland? Well, guess what? We're sending you to Gestapo land. Okay. We're going to look through your phone. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=199.16s)]
*  And if you've ever said something mean about Donald Trump, we're going to not let you into the country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=227.24s)]
*  America has decided to do a BDS on its own. Damn self. Incredible stuff. Ay, does Gestapo land have funnel cake? Yeah, every ICE agent is eating funnel cake. You don't get to have any of it. They're all they all look like fat animatronics and move like fat animatronics. But you don't get to have any of the funnel cake. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=233.52s)]
*  Rogan wanted to perform his comedy here in Vancouver during COVID, but the venue wouldn't let him do it unvaccinated. We've been commies ever since. Yeah. To be fair, I would use that as a reason to not let Rogan in as well. If I had the opportunity, I'd be like, sorry. Next week, everyone is unvaccinated. But just Joe Rogan is like, oh, sorry. This week, we just are not letting any unvaccinated comedians in. Sorry. Oh, what are you going to do? That's crazy. The ban for unvaccinated comedians extended by one week. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=254.72s)]
*  Oh, no. I hate to report this to you, but it seems like if you're five foot six, bald and unvaccinated, that's like, you see the sign back there? It's just, I don't mean to make this about you. And it certainly isn't. But it's wild that the rules dictate that this very, very specific rule. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qIfs4A0Pg&t=311.88000000000005s)]
