# Undecided Voters Could Change the Race | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0)
*  I have a genuine belief that like every undecided voter is just a Republican voter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=0.0s)]
*  I believe that. Because if you look at a guy like Donald Trump and you're like, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  I'm undecided about, I want to go out and vote, but I don't know, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=11.6s)]
*  let me hear out this Trump guy. Like, yeah, you're probably a Trump guy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=14.96s)]
*  As the clock is, of course, ticking for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to try to win those [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=30.0s)]
*  voters over less than 50 days. CNN's senior data reporter Harry Endon is joining us now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=34.56s)]
*  How many are there? Because it's kind of hard to... [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=39.6s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, the argument that they're making now is not even like undocumented or, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=42.88s)]
*  you know, doing. They're now saying documented migrants are doing. They're saying documented [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=47.2s)]
*  Haitian migrants are doing. When you look at the data for the likelihood of a documented migrant [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=51.68s)]
*  doing, it is so insanely low. It's even lower than undocumented migrants. And the number for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=57.6s)]
*  undocumented migrants is also very low. But for documented migrants is even lower. So now we're [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  just like, now we are just straight up lying at that point. Okay. But the goalpost is now officially [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=69.44s)]
*  firmly moved into actually we don't want legal immigrants in the country either. Okay. Like, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=76.8s)]
*  it's no longer about undocumented immigrants. Now it is, well, I would say that it never really [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=83.2s)]
*  was about just undocumented immigrants. You'd be an idiot if you think that that was the case. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=88.08s)]
*  It always has and always will be white supremacy. Okay. It is always the idea that they're changing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=92.48s)]
*  the genetic makeup of America. They're changing the demographics of America. Demographics are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=100.64s)]
*  of destiny. They are doing white. It always comes back to that age old canard, the white supremacist [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=104.88s)]
*  rallying cry. It's kind of hard to believe but the bottom line is that 4% 4% in the average of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=113.2s)]
*  polls 4% of voters say that they are undecided. Do you feel like liberals are backtracking on [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=121.28s)]
*  immigration policies offers credence to this type of anti immigrant rhetoric? Yes, I have been saying [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  this for I've been saying this for months, but I've also been saying this for years, but especially [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=130.16s)]
*  relevant in the last couple of months since Biden came out with a right wing white nativist [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=138.24s)]
*  anti-immigrant bill. That is just half the level that we saw in 2020. Well less than the 10% we saw [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=145.44s)]
*  at this point in 2016. So the bottom line is in this particular election, Kamala Harris and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=151.44s)]
*  Donald Trump are focusing their attention on this tiny, tiny sliver much lower than we're used to. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=157.28s)]
*  In fact, it's the lowest level of undecideds that we've seen in polling at this point this entire [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=163.6s)]
*  21st century. You know what that is not surprising at all that that number is so low, but within the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=168.96s)]
*  margin of error all the polls that you've been looking at that number is extremely. It can make [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=175.12s)]
*  all the difference in the world. So what do these undecideds care about? What are their big issues? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=180.16s)]
*  What are their top? Let me guess. Let me guess. Let me guess. They want they want tax cuts. They [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=185.84s)]
*  want deregulation. They want more war. They want NATO. They want immigrants. And if Kamala Harris [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=192.48s)]
*  doesn't secure all five of these at the same time, these undecideds will vote for the Republican [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=199.44s)]
*  Party, except they will vote for the Republican Party even after Kamala Harris makes a pledge to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=204.56s)]
*  do all five of those things that they want. So let's see. Well, perhaps not surprisingly, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=211.44s)]
*  30% say the economy inflation. That's number one. But number two, they actually don't have a top [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=217.2s)]
*  issue. 28% say there is no top issue, which perhaps isn't so surprising given that they're [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  probably not as tuned into politics. They might care more about the characteristics of the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=228.56s)]
*  candidates themselves rather than the issues that they represent. But I think that you get this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=232.88s)]
*  I love that American media totally looks at like the absolute people in society and consistently [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=237.6s)]
*  props them up as like the only people that matter in the conversation. It's great. I think we are [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=244.0s)]
*  actively positioning we are actively positioning people to be even and large chunk of undecideds [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=249.28s)]
*  right that are the large chunk within the undecideds who say there's no top issue. That of course makes [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=255.6s)]
*  it difficult for the campaigns to go after them. Because what exactly are you going to talk about [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=260.16s)]
*  to the folks who say, Wait a minute, we don't have a top issue. Right. That's that's a hard thing. But [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=264.64s)]
*  obviously the economy, the economy of the economy, that is the issue that seems to be [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=269.92s)]
*  across all. So there are a lot of people we just sort of mentioned this, that don't really understand [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=274.64s)]
*  how anyone could be undecided at this point in the election cycle and with this particular [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=279.68s)]
*  particular election. So what's the deal? What's the deal? Well, I think this might sort of get at it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=284.24s)]
*  2024 is the most important election of my life. 72% of Trump backers say it is 70% of Harris [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=289.6s)]
*  backers say it is but just 24% of undecideds say it is. So the bottom line is they don't actually [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=295.84s)]
*  think there's that much on the line going on here. And that is I think part of the reason why [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=302.24s)]
*  they're willing to stay back and just say, you know what, I don't really necessarily like either [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=306.64s)]
*  of these folks. I don't think this is the most important election. So you know, I'm going to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=310.48s)]
*  continue to be undecided. Of course, there's just 4% of them. But that 4% Okay, take it back. They're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=313.92s)]
*  actually brilliant. He's going to make all the difference in the world come November, they very [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=319.68s)]
*  well could. But if they're not paying attention, like you said, they might start paying attention [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  as we get very, very, very close to the election. Exactly. But at this point, they just don't really [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=328.8s)]
*  think 2024 is that important. So that's why they're not paying attention. All right, Harry and then [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=333.44s)]
*  we know we think is important. But there's that. All right, Kate. All right. Joining us right now [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=337.36s)]
*  is Republican Congressman from Florida. Trump. Remember, the average undecider and focus groups [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=341.36s)]
*  usually hold two views that counter each other easily. Yeah, exactly. They literally in the same [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=346.16s)]
*  breath will say, I love immigrants. I work with immigrants every day. They're wonderful. And they [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=350.56s)]
*  help the economy. And then they'll be like, we have to deport every single one of them. And not [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=357.04s)]
*  and not a single one of them will ever turn around and be like, is this inherently contradicting? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=362.48s)]
*  They will not. They will never question it. And because of the way that because of the way that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=368.8s)]
*  American society, American exceptionalism and American individualism works, those unique [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=375.6s)]
*  snowflakes are truly brilliant. And you have to treat them as though they are truly brilliant. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=381.6s)]
*  And not like what you just said is the thing I've ever heard. Ryan Ruth is that man. Okay, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=386.8s)]
*  seemingly he made up his mind at the end. But if you look at his like political opinions over the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=393.76s)]
*  course of many, many years as we did, you will realize what it looks like in the mind of an [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=400.48s)]
*  average undecided swing voter. Okay, make no mistake. I'm not saying like, oh, dude, you're [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=405.6s)]
*  like, I don't know if they're conflating undecided voters with unconvinced voters. Okay, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=412.96s)]
*  I suspect that there's a little bit of that going on in a lot of these instances. Because the idea [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=419.44s)]
*  of like undecided is, is basically like, I could vote for Trump, or I could vote for Kamala, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=425.28s)]
*  I'm undecided. When in fact, many people are not conflicted between the two, even though if you [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=433.84s)]
*  ask the New York Times, they only care about people who are conflicted between the two, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=441.2s)]
*  which is very frustrating, because most people aren't like that. Okay, it's actually people that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  are deciding between voting or sitting on the couch. Oh, yeah, Ryan Ruth was undecided between [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=454.0s)]
*  voting for Kamala Harris or shooting Donald Trump campaign surrogate Byron Donalds, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=461.52s)]
*  Congressman, it's good to see you. Thank you for coming in. Bouncing off the conversation that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=466.08s)]
*  Harry and Sarah were just having, how undecided do you think the diminishing number of undecided [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=469.52s)]
*  voters really are this election at this point? I believe there's someone. I also have a firm [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=475.44s)]
*  commitment. I have a genuine belief that like every undecided voter is just a Republican voter. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=481.68s)]
*  I believe that Mike, because if you if you look at a guy like Donald Trump, and you're like, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=488.08s)]
*  I'm undecided about, I want to go out and vote, but I don't know, let me hear out this Trump guy, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=494.08s)]
*  like, yeah, you're probably a Trump guy. Aren't you undecided? No, dude, what the I should probably [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=498.8s)]
*  say I'm undecided. Maybe then the New York Times will interview me so I can talk about Israel and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=504.16s)]
*  then they'll definitely not put that in the article. No, I'm not undecided. I'm riding in [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=508.88s)]
*  Biden, baby. I'm riding in Biden. Dude, at this point, please do it if you were a former Trump [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=514.32s)]
*  voter, and you're claiming to be undecided. What the do you need to hear? How many former Trump [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=521.12s)]
*  voters who are still currently undecided exist? Get the out of here, dude. No, they're voting for [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=527.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, but they're still like kind of embarrassed about it. Okay, that's it. Suck my [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  if you claim to be undecided between Kamala and Trump. At this point, and you're a lifelong [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=539.52s)]
*  Republican voter, and you voted for Trump twice, you're gonna vote for Trump. Like, what are we [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  doing? Of course you're gonna vote for Trump. It's so transparent. It's so stupid. Not even last week [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=551.76s)]
*  you were saying I don't know who I'm voting for, but I'll never vote for Trump or something similar. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=558.72s)]
*  No, last week I was also saying I'm voting for Biden. I'm riding in Biden, baby. Also, I'm a [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=562.4s)]
*  political commentator. There's a lot of people who want to cast aside my commentary by simply saying, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=567.36s)]
*  oh, he's a Harris supporter, or oh, he's a Trump supporter. That is the reason why I do not declare [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=574.64s)]
*  who I would be supporting in the election. It's because people want to say, oh, he's not going [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=580.72s)]
*  to vote for Kamala Harris, so don't listen to him. Everything he says, it's not about like who I'm [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=584.96s)]
*  voting for at all. It's actually entirely about how to make my commentary seem less relevant. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=589.12s)]
*  So of course, of course, make up your own goddamn minds. Okay, Trump supporter or not, people only [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=596.0s)]
*  want to know if you'll vote for Harris or not. Yeah, exactly. And for the record, I'm unconvinced. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=601.76s)]
*  And not only that, but also I'm riding in Biden. Step aside, liberals. You will not be able to [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=607.76s)]
*  convince me. What you did to Joseph Robinette Brandon was inexcusable. And I, as an AUKUS voter, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  me and Ryan Routh are going to hold hands at the poll and we're going to go cast a ballot. We're [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=620.8s)]
*  going to write in Biden. I think they're juggling through the realities of America. Number one, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=627.36s)]
*  the economy, this massive inflation created by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden in our country are [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=632.72s)]
*  real. They're looking at that. But then I also do believe they're having to for the record, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=638.72s)]
*  I'm not on one team or another. Okay, I'm on whoever advances, whoever advances and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=643.44s)]
*  improves the material conditions of the working class. Okay, that's whose side I'm on. And neither [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=651.36s)]
*  party is even remotely trying to make a convincing case that they are on the side of the working [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=658.0s)]
*  class. Neither party is doing that. So I will forever criticize both parties for not doing that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=666.4s)]
*  Okay. Juggle with also a lot of the rhetoric that's out there in terms of where the country's going [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=672.8s)]
*  and who's going to protect the country. And I think if you look at the facts, the facts are very [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=678.48s)]
*  clear that Donald Trump addresses the issues that concerns Americans, the economy, our borders and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=682.48s)]
*  our foreign policy. And what vice president Harris is talking about is not those issues. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=688.16s)]
*  There are people that literally less than two months until the election and we can hear the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=693.44s)]
*  candidates voices nearly every day. But what about voters? Since June, the news hour has followed a [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  group of undecided voters from across the country and across the political spectrum. What if I'm an [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  undecided voter who really cares about NATO? There was only one candidate who did NATO and now he's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=708.48s)]
*  not in the race. I cried that day. Yeah. I mean, I'm that voter. It's me. It's Ryan Ruth. We are [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=712.64s)]
*  together. We are committed. Okay. Joe Biden did NATO and he's going to do Taiwan. It's me. It's [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=719.04s)]
*  Ryan Ruth. It's Van Jones. In our latest installment of the deciders series, we found some movement [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=726.0s)]
*  and a lot of thoughts. My name is Steven Beck and I'm from Madison, Alabama. No, you heard a lot of [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=733.28s)]
*  statements. You didn't hear a lot of thoughts. You had a lot of you heard a lot of statements, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=738.24s)]
*  but not a lot of thoughts. You heard the opposite of thoughts in my opinion. In past election [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=743.52s)]
*  cycles, I have not been undecided. This would probably be the first time I've been truly [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=748.0s)]
*  undecided, especially this late in the game. Wait, wait, wait, wait, ask him who we voted for. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=752.72s)]
*  My name is Jessica Dalton. I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah. Undecided, I think is too vague of a term. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=759.2s)]
*  I've always been open to listen to what each candidate has to offer and making my decision [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=764.48s)]
*  based on who the candidate is rather than what the party is offering. I'm Zach Warren and I'm [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  35 years old based in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. I'm one of those voters that does wait to the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=775.04s)]
*  last second. I remember my even back to like 2008 and 2012 and 16. I always wake up on election day [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=779.6s)]
*  and make that choice because there's a lot of things that can happen between now and that's [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=786.0s)]
*  this is okay. This guy's awesome. Also chat. This man is two years older than me. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=790.4000000000001s)]
*  This man is only two years older than me. My name is Steven Stone. I'm in Brooklyn. I have to choose [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=796.64s)]
*  between Kamala or just not voting for the president in this election. I'm Robert Lilly. That guy was [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  cool. I can tell. I typically don't decide. And for sure I'm not a hundred percent until [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=809.84s)]
*  election time. My name is Anna and I live in the suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. Before the debate, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=819.2s)]
*  I was already against Trump. That's not happening. I don't trust either of them as commander in chief [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=825.76s)]
*  or even as necessarily head of government. I would say that neither lived up to my expectations. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  One of the things that I had difficulty with throughout the entire debate was the lack of [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  specifics. It seems like a race to the bottom. More than anything, it's not about anybody [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=842.16s)]
*  having any sort of real ideology and the concerns of the majority of American people at heart. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=847.6s)]
*  It felt very much about just being better than your competitor. She went in for the handshake. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=854.88s)]
*  That actually meant something to me. I think civility is going to be the number one thing. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=860.96s)]
*  We have to get back to that before we can get back to anything else. What was interesting and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=864.56s)]
*  not surprising from Donald Trump was how easily he was baited into getting his ego hurt. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  There's just too many lies told by Kamala Harris in the debate and I expect that to go on. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=876.88s)]
*  She did a fantastic job during that debate. I thought that there was some policy depth that [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=882.8s)]
*  was offered. I did feel when I was watching it that they did question him more than they questioned [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=887.76s)]
*  her on some things. I expected them to say what they said. I would have appreciated additional [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=893.6s)]
*  specifics. I'm sure that in the coming months, I'll be able to do some more additional research. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=901.36s)]
*  I'll take some time to look and examine that more closely. After watching Harris come into [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=905.68s)]
*  the debate and how she handled herself, there's no question in my mind that I will be voting for [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=912.16s)]
*  Harris and Walls. I'm holding out hope and believing that potentially some of these other [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=916.3199999999999s)]
*  movements, these leftist movements, again, the Green Party to move her more left as opposed to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=921.68s)]
*  the right. It does not feel good. At best, I would be holding my nose to vote for Kamala. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  Not knowing enough about her is part of the indecisiveness as far as who... [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=931.92s)]
*  Finally, dude. This is the first time I've ever heard someone openly state this in any one of [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=936.8s)]
*  these different polls where the guy's like, thank God. Thank Christ, dude. There's like one. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=942.88s)]
*  I'm going to vote for at this point. Donald Trump, I... [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=948.4799999999999s)]
*  Great message, but Green's come on, man. He didn't say he's voting for Jill Stein. He said he hopes [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=951.68s)]
*  that the Green Party will be able to convince and move Kamala Harris to the left, which they won't. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=955.76s)]
*  I see is just a much lesser of two evils. And so that's the man I had to vote for. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=961.92s)]
*  These are not easy decisions to make. They touch on so many aspects of our lives and they don't [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  just affect us individually, they affect us globally. He's still a man of the sun, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=972.64s)]
*  quit glazing. Why is he a mess? He's right. What? Why is he a mess? He's right. He's saying it's [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=977.04s)]
*  ridiculous to demand someone's vote without making any concessions whatsoever. Bro, go back to 200 IQ [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=982.7199999999999s)]
*  with that Green Party. No, he's... I mean, he's silly for thinking that the Democratic Party is [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=989.84s)]
*  going to move to the left, but he just used the Greens as an example. He didn't say he's voting [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=994.72s)]
*  for the Green Party, did he? Did I miss it? No, he just said he hopes that leftist movements or the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=999.36s)]
*  Green Party will be able to convince and move Kamala Harris to the left. And unless that happens, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1005.76s)]
*  he's not going to vote. That's a good thing, dude. You should... If you ever get a call, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1011.76s)]
*  from one of these places, you should say that. You should say that all the time. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1016.24s)]
*  Leading up to election day, I'm looking forward to Vice President Harris and Governor Walsh [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1019.76s)]
*  speaking more to their economic policies, specifically their small business initiatives. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1023.84s)]
*  I think those are very important, as well as childcare. I think those go hand in hand [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1028.16s)]
*  and their stance on women's healthcare. I wish I could vote for my values in this election. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1033.04s)]
*  I'll still be voting because there's a lot of down-ballot votes that... [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1038.8s)]
*  Okay, this dude is literally here. Okay, which one of you is this guy? Come on. Come on, come on, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1042.16s)]
*  come on. Come on, cop to it. Like, come on. ...are important to me, as they should be to everyone. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1046.88s)]
*  Not voting is never an option. That is my privilege as an American citizen. People have laid down [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  their lives for that, and I will vote in every election that I'm asked to vote in. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  As divisive as it is, I still think that... I still have this belief that we're going to be okay and [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1062.8000000000002s)]
*  that we're going to do the right thing and that things are going to be all right. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1069.12s)]
*  Can we get a percentage take on Trump slash Harris? Who do you think is on top right now? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1073.6s)]
*  It's Harris. Last guy said civility is his top issue. That's so funny because, like, again, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  that guy's voting for Trump. You want to know why? Because if he's saying civility is his top issue [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1083.4399999999998s)]
*  and he's still undecided at this point, then he's voting for Trump. Because if you don't think Trump [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1088.08s)]
*  is uncivil, an uncivilized monster, okay? Also, I hate that, like, CNN has this clown [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1092.96s)]
*  talking about undecided voters. Like, I don't want to watch the rest of this. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlwAfrbPi0&t=1101.92s)]
