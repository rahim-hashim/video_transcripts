# Hasan's First Day In Japan With Willneff & Caroline | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo)
*  Who's going to be the first to just like be an annoying piece of shit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=0.0s)]
*  Anyway, why am I complaining about this? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=3.12s)]
*  I'm in Japan and I'm having a great time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=4.44s)]
*  OK. Don't be assholes is my point. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=6.96s)]
*  I'm sensitive. I'm sensitive. I'm sensitive. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=10.28s)]
*  I feel so dead to me because there's I'm sensitive. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=12.92s)]
*  I have feelings and bitches. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=16.84s)]
*  You I'm not an animal. OK, I know. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=19.52s)]
*  I know I'm like a streaming. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=21.88s)]
*  I come across like a streaming animal to you, but I'm not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=24.28s)]
*  So, folks, this is part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=30.0s)]
*  It is currently one twenty four twenty twenty five. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=35.88s)]
*  January 24th, fourth day of the Burger Reich, twenty twenty five. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=40.76s)]
*  That is, of course, in Los Angeles, California. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=46.6s)]
*  Right now, where I'm at in Japan, it is actually Saturday 25th. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=49.24s)]
*  It's the 25th of January on Saturday and it is actually five twenty a.m. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=55.76s)]
*  Of course, like I said, I operate off of Los Angeles time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=61.36s)]
*  I operate off of the PST [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=64.48s)]
*  because that's where I reside and that's where my bread and butter is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=69.52s)]
*  So that's the reason why I'm up at five a.m. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=73.68s)]
*  Also, what's happening? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=76.72s)]
*  See a little bit of issues with focus. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=79.68s)]
*  Got to make sure I can fix that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=83.44s)]
*  Austin, why are you up? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=85.72s)]
*  What? Austin's up. That's crazy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=87.6s)]
*  All right. Well, folks, that's wild. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=90.96s)]
*  This is a wild Austin show out in the wild and he's awake. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=93.76s)]
*  That's weird. Why is that weird? Because. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=97.36s)]
*  We were out last night late, like, I mean, not super late, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  but I did stay out till like, I think, eleven. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=105.08s)]
*  Which was crazy for me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=109.8s)]
*  Like, I don't know how I did that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=112.36s)]
*  But yeah, this is a part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  about what's going on in the world of a son house and I would probably [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  come in between the time period where I press the stop streaming button [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=120.16s)]
*  and press the start streaming button. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  And a lot has happened in my world. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  And that's precisely what we're talking about right now, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  So first and foremost, I ended the broadcast last night. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=130.84s)]
*  I ended the broadcast last night, I guess, last night for you guys, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=136.16s)]
*  even though it was like basically the morning for me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=139.16s)]
*  And. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=142.84s)]
*  Is midday for me, I guess. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=145.4s)]
*  Mike is noise getting too much, but I don't care. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=147.2s)]
*  Shut up. It's fine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  OK, I don't want you here in my sleepy farts. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  Wait, is it bad? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=155.68s)]
*  I was getting too strong. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=156.88s)]
*  Is that new or is it because my noise gate has always been the same? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm kind of confused by what chatters are saying. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=163.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of bad. It was bad yesterday, too. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=165.76s)]
*  No, we can hear you just fine. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  It just kind of cuts out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=169.76s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=172.0s)]
*  I don't recall it being this bad. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=174.32s)]
*  It was clipping. It's fine. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=177.12s)]
*  You just have sleepy voice. I don't know. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=178.72s)]
*  Anyway, Mike is cutting out the last syllables of your sentence. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=180.6s)]
*  Huh? That's interesting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  I didn't realize the microphone was having issues like that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=188.44s)]
*  Anyway, I'm not talking quiet. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=192.16s)]
*  I'm talking the normal voice that I talk in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=194.84s)]
*  So I don't know why it's happening. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=197.44s)]
*  The streets are calling you half day, Hossie Bubba. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=199.16s)]
*  I know. So that's my name now because I did. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=201.6s)]
*  I'm doing six hour broadcast now, even if even if I'm like [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=205.64s)]
*  flying in and out of Japan is crazy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=210.24s)]
*  Like, they're calling me half day, Hossie, for sure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  And for good reason, because what am I doing? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=216.32s)]
*  I'm doing half days. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=218.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. What was I going to say? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So we had issues with the backpack, as you guys know. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=222.24s)]
*  We had issues with backpacks. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=227.56s)]
*  Oh, which is really annoying. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=229.28s)]
*  So goddamn expensive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=232.2s)]
*  And I also literally, you know, bought it so that we wouldn't have issues [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=234.84s)]
*  so that I could like provide higher quality content. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=238.96s)]
*  So when the thing that you're like supposed to provide higher quality [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=242.16s)]
*  content with actually ends up doing a worse job overall, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  it's just like kind of breaks your brain a little bit, at least for me. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=249.72s)]
*  Anyway, ever since Trump became president, changement is true. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=253.68s)]
*  I'm no longer the real me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=257.16s)]
*  I'm no longer feeling it like that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=258.88s)]
*  Anyway, where was I? What was I saying? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=260.76s)]
*  What is my my noise gate is to my is it really that bad? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=266.88s)]
*  This one is it bad? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=271.6s)]
*  Is it because I'm like not loud or something? What's happening? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=272.68s)]
*  What about now? Is this better? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=275.4s)]
*  I lowered the threshold. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=276.88s)]
*  We actually. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=279.48s)]
*  The better to make the threshold higher, or is it worse? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=281.48s)]
*  You sound fine. I don't know. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=284.84s)]
*  I don't know. Shit, Mike. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=286.84s)]
*  OK, calm down, everybody. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=289.08s)]
*  That's a teeny bit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=291.08s)]
*  I think that's probably the attack and the release. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=292.4s)]
*  I suspect there's something to do with the attack and the release. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=295.12s)]
*  But in any case, we'll we'll get back to this in a second. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=298.96s)]
*  So where was I? Where was I? Where was I? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=302.44s)]
*  Where was I? I think you were we are used to you streaming [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=305.0s)]
*  after you've been up all morning. Yeah, that's true. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=307.28s)]
*  I am kind of EP right now. I'm an EP boy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=309.24s)]
*  I'm an EP boy. What is this? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=312.56s)]
*  Um, a far right named John Minadio [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=315.44s)]
*  who's currently on Twitter with 30K followers, grooming kids on Twitter [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=318.92s)]
*  and coaching them in the years and his name is Gigafash Bird on Twitter. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=321.48s)]

*  and reported him many times and nothing is happening. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=328.92s)]
*  Well, don't worry when the next terror incident happens [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=331.92s)]
*  and he's directly responsible for it, the FBI can turn around [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=334.92s)]
*  and say he was on our radar. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=337.92s)]
*  So, yeah, do they have basketball in Japan near you? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=339.44s)]
*  Um, maybe you sound like you've been up all night at the arcade. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=341.88s)]
*  No, so that's actually what I was going to talk about. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=346.12s)]
*  So I what did I do? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=348.8s)]
*  We ended the broadcast. We went shopping, right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  I couldn't actually use my SIM card. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=353.4s)]
*  My my SIM cards that they sent me, they actually sent me [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  I show speed SIM cards, unfortunately, because we work with the same company [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=358.92s)]
*  and and they were geo locked for his goddamn Latin American trip. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=364.08s)]
*  OK, yeah, the international SIM cards that I'm supposed to have are are [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=369.72s)]
*  geo locked for North America and Latin America. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=375.88s)]
*  Does that mean he has your SIMs? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=378.76000000000005s)]
*  Yes, he has my international SIM cards. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=380.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in Japan and my goddamn SIM card is like what? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=382.76000000000005s)]

*  Wait, why? It's not the microphone's fault. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=408.56s)]
*  You just sound a bit rusty because you just woke up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  You disappointed us yesterday, brother. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=413.72s)]

*  We went to our special curry spot, Japanese curry spot. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=982.72s)]
*  And it was a lot more welcoming to Gaijin this time around [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=986.48s)]
*  than the last time we were out there, which was, I guess, a little disappointing [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=990.12s)]
*  because I think in Japan, you know, it's [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=994.76s)]
*  the cardigan is La Mer in Japan. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=999.36s)]
*  I think like the food is best served with a side of anti white racism. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1001.72s)]
*  Remember the last time I came to Japan and I talked about how like it's awesome [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1005.8000000000001s)]
*  that they do like anti white racism here. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1009.88s)]
*  And then it's really unique because like you, if you're white, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1012.5200000000001s)]
*  you basically have to travel to a different country to experience racism [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1016.0s)]
*  like a tourist. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1019.76s)]
*  And a lot of people canceled me for saying that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1020.72s)]
*  But it's like probably one of my best takes. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1023.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I get like disappointed if they're not, I get disappointed [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1026.6s)]
*  if they're accommodating. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1030.56s)]
*  I'm gatekeeping Japan, dude. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1031.9599999999998s)]
*  It needs to be isolationist. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1033.6s)]
*  I'm a Japanese isolationist. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1035.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1038.04s)]
*  I'm a Japanese isolationist who believes that Japan must continue being [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1039.4399999999998s)]
*  Japanese and xenophobic because if they open up their borders too much, they're [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1045.28s)]
*  going to be more accommodating at the, at the curry restaurants. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUN4gppjsFo&t=1050.1999999999998s)]
