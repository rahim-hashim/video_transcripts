# Europe Vows ‘Firm Response’ To Latest Trump Tariffs On Car Parts | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA)
*  This is unironically a good thing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=0.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think this is a bad thing. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=2.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he has any capacity to enforce this, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  but I'm not gonna shit on this part of it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=10.0s)]
*  Does he have the power? No, but he has the flex. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=13.36s)]
*  He has the threats. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=17.32s)]
*  But this is very exciting. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=23.72s)]
*  So we're signing a executive order today [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=25.12s)]
*  that's gonna lead to tremendous growth in the automobile industry. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  What we're going to be doing is a 25% tariff [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=32.24s)]
*  on all cars that are not made in the United States. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=35.44s)]
*  If they're made in the United States, there's absolutely no tariff. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=38.24s)]
*  And with that, Donald Trump made his most aggressive trade move so far, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=41.24s)]
*  slapping tariffs on all cars coming into America and all car parts, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=46.24s)]
*  a move that will significantly raise the cost of vehicles [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=51.84s)]
*  being imported to the US from around the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=55.36s)]
*  But also, whether he realises it or not [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=58.36s)]
*  will hike the price of cars made in America by American car makers too. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=61.36s)]
*  Right now, a car would be made here, sent to Canada, sent to Mexico, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=67.36s)]
*  sent all over the place. It's ridiculous. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=71.36s)]
*  He's right. The supply chain for car manufacturing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=73.36s)]
*  is among the most intertwined in the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=76.36s)]
*  So tariffs against some will... [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=79.36s)]
*  The only thing I don't understand about this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=81.36s)]
*  is why the UAW likes these tariffs. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=83.48s)]
*  Because as it stands currently, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=86.48s)]
*  the American car manufacturing is not done in America. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=88.48s)]
*  It's done in America, Mexico and Canada. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=92.48s)]
*  So it is the one area where we have the industrial capacity [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=96.48s)]
*  to ramp up production significantly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=101.48s)]
*  and actually boost domestic labour and boost domestic manufacturing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=104.48s)]
*  It's true. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=109.48s)]
*  It's one of the only industries we have aside from baby machines. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  So as I've said before, I'm not anti-tariff across the board. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm not unconditionally anti-tariff. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  I think trade protectionism, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  especially in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  can be valuable. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=128.6s)]
*  Having said that, I don't know what their plans are, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=130.6s)]
*  especially in terms of all the other parts of the cars [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=136.6s)]
*  being made in Mexico and Canada. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=139.72s)]
*  But in the interim, prices will definitely go up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=141.72s)]
*  Ford Trucks is also a baby killing machine? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=144.72s)]
*  OK, that's different. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=146.72s)]
*  It will hurt them all, as the market's made immediately clear. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=147.72s)]
*  Japan's Toyota in Europe, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=151.72s)]
*  we're looking at Mercedes-Benz and Porsche shares [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=153.72s)]
*  down by around 3 to 4%. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=156.72s)]
*  The biggest automover, though, at this hour, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=158.72s)]
*  is General Motors, down nearly 9%. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=160.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's rationale is that the rest of the world [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=163.72s)]
*  has been ripping America off for decades. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=165.72s)]
*  Trade deals, particularly in the auto sector, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=168.84s)]
*  have decimated US manufacturing and jobs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=171.84s)]
*  Now he wants to bring... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=174.84s)]
*  And he's trying to use tariffs to force car makers [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=176.84s)]
*  to do their manufacturing here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=179.84s)]
*  Now that may well work in the long term, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=181.84s)]
*  but in the short term, car prices for US consumers will rise. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=184.84s)]
*  Demand will likely fall, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=189.84s)]
*  and thousands of US jobs could be lost again. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=191.84s)]
*  Prices on autos are just going to rise across the globe, really, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=194.84s)]
*  which is pretty tough, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=197.96s)]
*  because when you think about every country right now, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=199.96s)]
*  everyone's facing higher cost of living, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=201.96s)]
*  everything has gotten more expensive, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=203.96s)]
*  and cars are such a big budget item for many people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=205.96s)]
*  So having to absorb these increased costs [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=208.96s)]
*  is really hitting a hard time [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=210.96s)]
*  for all consumers across the world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=212.96s)]
*  So who stands to be the hardest hit? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=214.96s)]
*  Well, by far it's Mexico, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=216.96s)]
*  given the US imports nearly 80 billion worth of vehicles [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=218.96s)]
*  from its southern neighbour. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=221.96s)]
*  Why does chat keep spamming cum? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=223.96s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=225.96s)]
*  Followed by Japan, worth nearly 40 billion, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=227.08s)]
*  then South Korea, and Canada, with over 30 billion worth. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=230.08s)]
*  In Europe, the US imports most cars from Germany, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=234.08s)]
*  almost $25 billion worth, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=238.08s)]
*  and imports from the UK, while smaller, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=240.08s)]
*  are still worth more than $8 billion. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=243.08s)]
*  You know, this will hurt us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=246.08s)]
*  Canada's Prime Minister was visiting a bridge [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=248.08s)]
*  that connects his country to the US [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=250.08s)]
*  and is a key trading hub [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=252.08s)]
*  when news of Trump's tariffs hit. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=254.08s)]
*  This is a direct attack, to be clear, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=256.2s)]
*  a direct attack on the very workers [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=259.2s)]
*  that I stood in front of at the Ambassador Bridge. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=262.2s)]
*  A bridge is a symbol of the tight ties [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=265.2s)]
*  between our two countries' ties. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=268.2s)]
*  Their audio is busted. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=270.2s)]
*  Canada has already been taken down [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=272.2s)]
*  with these tariffs, dude. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=274.2s)]
*  Canada, United States, Mexico equals cum? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=276.2s)]
*  They are in the process of being broken. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=278.2s)]
*  Broken ties, he says, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=281.2s)]
*  because don't forget, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=283.32s)]
*  Canada has also been clobbered by Trump's tariffs [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=285.32s)]
*  on steel and aluminium imports, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=288.32s)]
*  as has Mexico, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=290.32s)]
*  whose president sounded defiant today. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=292.32s)]
*  We have to defend the jobs created in Mexico [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=297.32s)]
*  and defend Mexican companies too. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=300.32s)]
*  Of course, within the Mexico-US-Canada trade agreement, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=302.32s)]
*  there should be no tariffs. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=306.32s)]
*  That is the essence of the trade agreement. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=308.32s)]
*  If this has to happen, I will regret it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=313.32s)]
*  And of course, the Europeans will protect themselves [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=316.32s)]
*  by reciprocating. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=319.32s)]
*  Perhaps anticipating a wave of retaliation, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=321.32s)]
*  President Trump took to social media [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=324.32s)]
*  in the early hours, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=326.32s)]
*  that if the European Union works with Canada [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=328.32s)]
*  to do economic harm to the USA, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=330.32s)]
*  large-scale tariffs, far larger than currently planned, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=333.32s)]
*  will be placed on them both [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=337.32s)]
*  to protect the best friend [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=339.32s)]
*  that each of those two countries ever had. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=341.44s)]
*  Car tariffs today, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=344.44s)]
*  another round of reciprocal tariffs next week. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=346.44s)]
*  With best friends like that, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=349.44s)]
*  who needs enemies? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=351.44s)]
*  Well, the Office for Budget Responsibility [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=353.44s)]
*  estimated that a full-scale trade [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=355.44s)]
*  could wipe out all the £9.9 billion of headroom [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=357.44s)]
*  the Chancellor bought herself [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=360.44s)]
*  with the spending cuts she announced yesterday. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=362.44s)]
*  Rachel Reeves is pinning her hopes [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=364.44s)]
*  on government negotiators [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=366.44s)]
*  striking a deal with the Trump administration [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=368.44s)]
*  that protects the UK. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=370.56s)]
*  Let's go live to our political editor, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=372.56s)]
*  Gary Gibbon in Westminster. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=374.56s)]
*  We've been in government about luxury car exporters [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=376.56s)]
*  who are particularly exposed to the American market [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=378.56s)]
*  and you talk to people in government [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=380.56s)]
*  they say Jaguar Land Rover is probably [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=382.56s)]
*  number one on their list of concerns. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=384.56s)]
*  But you're talking about [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=386.56s)]
*  what actually is President Trump [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=388.56s)]
*  going to decide on Liberation Day [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=390.56s)]
*  as he calls it next week [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=392.56s)]
*  and what we really know about the talks [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=394.56s)]
*  that are still ongoing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=396.56s)]
*  between Britain and the United States [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=398.68s)]
*  is that they are intensive [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=400.68s)]
*  they are nothing like normal trade agreement [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUrUloryOxA&t=402.68s)]
