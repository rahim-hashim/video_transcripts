# They Threaten Iranian Civilians | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q)
*  all of these guys that do the funny memes and it's like, Oh yeah. If you are, if you are during Ramadan as haram, like all those guys, they all have noticeably been absent from the conversation about Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  point, I think it was like 15, 16 months in people started being like, why the haven't these guys said anything about Israel at all? Anyway, we already covered this way as Iran. Let's watch how the Iranian civilians are responding to the Israeli strikes. Much. Hey has been made about coming. Israel is liberators. Much has been said about how much. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=19.0s)]
*  Iranians love being glassed. I wonder if BBC's coverage reflects that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=49.0s)]
*  Out strikes on each other. Civilians are being urged to seek shelter with the Iranian government using mosques, metro stations, schools and other buildings. Iran's government currently limits access to the country for journalists. But the BBC's Persian service provides news to Iranian audiences in Farsi. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=56.0s)]
*  Farham Gabbadi is a senior reporter at BBC Persian and earlier he updated me on what people in Iran are telling him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=74.0s)]
*  Many people who have texted me in the past 24 hours, they were complaining about that, that our voices are not heard. People don't know what we are going through. For example, one of the things that Iranian people are extremely worried about is what the Israeli defense minister has said recently after the last night barrage of missiles that Iran shot at Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=82.0s)]
*  And at least eight people, Israelis were killed. Iranian defense minister said that residents of Tehran will pay the price for that and soon they will pay the price for that. Right after that there was a report by Jerusalem Post saying that they expect that Israel will ask certain neighborhoods in Tehran to evacuate. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=103.0s)]
*  And things like that has worried a lot of, especially residents of Tehran, because they are saying that we are not the ones who are shooting missiles at you. We are, many of us are oppressed by this regime as well. And now we are the ones who are paying the price for that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=121.0s)]
*  So there are several things that they are worried about. One thing is that that overnight they cannot sleep. They've got sleepless nights because of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=136.0s)]
*  Why don't they let journalists in? Feels like it would be good for the world to know what's going on there. They do. They let in, I mean, fucking Max Blumenthal went there, but he's obviously very anti-America. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=146.0s)]
*  But I don't know. I suspect it's probably because they, they want to, it's the same as like, is the same principle behind China and Russia where they want to control all the flow of infringement coming in and out. And they also don't want espionage opportunities as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=159.0s)]
*  There's a many circumstances. This is like, the media is often used as like infiltration. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=175.0s)]
*  Attacks that are taking place across [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=185.0s)]
*  I'm live in Iran. I thought people would really support Israel or any other invader before the attacks. But when the bombs hit the mood shifted, haven't seen anybody happy about them, except on Twitter. In the real world, everyone is either [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=191.0s)]
*  They're in shock or haven't yet gotten a grasp of the situation. I mean, look at Lebanon. It's literally the gayest country in the region. Okay. Look at Lebanon, gayest country in the region and look at their attitude towards Hezbollah, which is an anti-gay militancy in times of Israel strikes on Lebanon. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=203.0s)]
*  It's the same shit. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=223.0s)]
*  It's the same shit. You got mad secular people who otherwise would, who otherwise would look at this as like a, like a Shia fighting force, even thinking about Hezbollah very differently because of Israeli violence. Wow. Can't believe the Iranians didn't like the statement is really [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=224.0s)]
*  Defense minister. Katz wows that the resident vows that the residents of Tehran will pay the price and soon after Ronnie missiles killed at least five people overnight as an Iranian. It's funny that you pronounce that I'm more correctly than this BBC Persian guy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=240.0s)]
*  Yeah. He doesn't want to scare the audience. That's why [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=250.0s)]
*  The one thing that unites the entire diverse Muslim world from Morocco to Iran to Indonesia is anti-Zionism. Yeah, for sure. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=255.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, the entire Muslim world's leadership, not so United on that principle, but the entire Muslim world is anti-Zionism. Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=263.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, the entire Muslim world's leadership, not so United on that principle, but the entire Muslim world, the populations are certainly from Tehran and other search and received videos last night that for dope, one of the important nuclear sites that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=271.0s)]
*  The one thing that unites the entire diverse Muslim world from Morocco to Iran to Indonesia is anti-Zionism. Yeah, for sure. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=280.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, the entire Muslim world's leadership, not so United on that principle, but the entire Muslim world, the populations are certainly [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=291.0s)]
*  That's why I said that for dope, one of the important nuclear sites was attacked Iranian officials are saying that Natanz the other side near as one was [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=298.0s)]

*  I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=316.0s)]
*  I've never seen a dude that looks like that hit a line like that before. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=346.0s)]
*  If you see no, not this guy, this guy sucks. Wait, this guy actually says something about Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=357.0s)]
*  No, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=363.2s)]
*  no, I'm not talking about this guy. This guy is notoriously a dick rider. Many of those famous Salafi shakes, Salafi shakes are such rapacious little [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=364.8s)]
*  Israel dick riders. They go to the UAE all the time. They, there is like, okay, listen, I don't know why I'm tapped into this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=375.56s)]
*  I don't know why I'm tapped into this because it's not within my field of interest at all. But, but I will [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=383.04s)]
*  tell you this. I will tell you this much. There is a lot of drama in the, in the famous Salafi shake world. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=392.36s)]
*  Okay. All of these guys that do the funny memes and it's like, Oh yeah. If you are, if you are during Ramadan is haram. Like all those guys, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=402.44s)]
*  they all have noticeably been absent from [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=413.44s)]
*  the conversation about Israel. And at a certain point, I think it was like 15, 16 months in people started being like, why haven't these guys said anything about Israel at all? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=418.84s)]
*  What is going on? And, and basically, basically then more information came out showing that they were like, some of these dudes were straight up like going to UAE and even meeting with like Israeli envoys and things like [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=430.28s)]
*  that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=447.28s)]
*  And the only time, the only time that they ever talk about it is like, is though they are like a, like a Hollywood celebrity that wants to make a statement, but also wants to keep [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=447.72s)]
*  their job where they'll say, well, they're say the war, like they'll be like, Oh, we must stop the war. Like, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=463.72s)]
*  weirdly enough, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=473.16s)]
*  like they have more smoke for, they have more smoke for, for Muslims who let their girlfriends out in the wild. Then they do for Israel's, blottering children in Palestine. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=478.16s)]
*  What is this? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=492.8s)]
*  If someone is at the, is in the UAE, you know, they only present pro Israel because the UAE won't tolerate it. Anyway, what is this? This guy, this guy, this guy is going to be like, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=500.8s)]
*  maybe, maybe too much, too much backlash. And he's now changing his team. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=513.96s)]
*  There's like two countries are fighting right now. What, and one of them is the Shia and one of them is Jewish and they both make many bad things to Muslims. So as Muslim, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=517.96s)]
*  are we allowed to cheer for one of them or should we just remain neutral? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=527.96s)]
*  Is this all what the Muslims can do? Cheer? Yeah, this is not a football game. This is not something that we, you know, go out in the street. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=530.96s)]
*  Dude, I swear to God, I swear to God, some of these Salafi, Salafis have brain damage. Okay. Like they unironically think that Shias are worse, older than the Muslims. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=542.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=558.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=561.96s)]
*  Streets with flags and supporting country X or country B or this or that. This is what we've always stated that is not permissible. That is the issue of demonstrations where lots of chaos, lots of haram things take place. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=583.96s)]
*  As Muslims, we side with anyone who claims to be Muslim, even if they're full of innovation, even if we believe in their hatred and enmity of Islam and the Muslims, yet [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=597.96s)]
*  still they're better than the other part, which is blatantly killing civilians, women, children, and the whole world is watching. And their ministers say that we would like to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=608.96s)]
*  all the children, all the suckling babies, even the dogs and donkeys and animals they have, we would like to wipe them all off, annihilate them. Is this [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=621.96s)]
*  This is the guy who said protests are haram Pakistani Twitter yelled at him for days. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=632.96s)]
*  Something plausible, disbelievers who are united against Islam. It is. And if any Muslim would have said this, they would have labeled the whole region as a region of terror and a bloodshed, a bloodthirsty violent fanatics. So we don't cheer. We judge things by what [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=637.96s)]
*  My white brother is a Salafist revert on ironic. This is Shia Muslims aren't really Muslims. Do what did he is he like a car crash victim? How the are you a white guy and become a Salafist revert? I don't understand it, dude. I don't know. It's like, is this how Catholics feel when they see all these like Catholic converts running around talking about how like the new Catholic Church is actually a bunch of pedophiles or whatever, but like the old one was good or some shit because they're too woke. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=658.96s)]
*  Like I don't get the revered stuff anyway. I don't get it. It's like I don't understand conversion adult conversion across the board. I find it really strange. But like especially to one of the most like fundamentalist parts. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=686.96s)]
*  Like this is so like what is a polar bear doing in Arlington? Whenever I see a white Salafist revert, I'm like, what are you used to go to Catholic school? And now he says Catholics aren't Christian either. Lamao Trump, everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. What possible explosions heard in Tehran? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=699.96s)]
*  Have you seen the Malaysia wants to send a flotilla about a thousand ships like the freedom flotilla? My friends are Salafists, but there are the two types of love is those who call themselves Salafists Eagles. They're brainwashed and those that follow Salaf way. Orthodox Muslims. Those are normal. I mean, I just don't get the fundamentalism no matter which religion it is. You know what I mean? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=729.96s)]
*  Trump, Iran should assign the deal. I told them to sign what a shame and waste of human life simply stated Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again. Everyone should immediately evacuate that on says IDF favorite correspondent Barack [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=746.96s)]
*  David. What the are they about to do, dude? Oh Jesus Christ. Al Jazeera on a goddamn on a ad break. What is this breaking? US nuclear sniffer plan is in the air. What? Okay. I don't, I don't want to. This is no, no, no. I don't know about all this. Okay. That seems here is his full statement. I gave Iran a chance. I gave Iran chance after she has to make a deal. I told them in the strongest words, just do it. But no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get it done. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=759.96s)]
*  I told them it would be much worse than anything they know anticipated or were told that the United States must. Oh no, there I told you, dude. I told you that they wouldn't do this after G7. That's from three days ago. But I'm are they? No, this is the new statement. Iran should assign the deal. I told them to sign what a shame and a waste of human life simply stated Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again. Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. This was three minutes ago. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. They just couldn't get it done. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=787.96s)]
*  This is three minutes ago. This is the new statement. A German Luftwaffe refueling plan was spotted above Jordan today, apparently paying the single transponder signal accidentally above Jordan. Wait, what do you mean? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=817.96s)]
*  Misinformation. This is this is not misinformation. This is Trump. This is Trump's latest statement reported on by also Barack Ravid. I didn't say they're using a nuke. Everybody calm down. This is the tweet. This is the repost of said tweet. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=831.84s)]
*  Will the G7 leaders with the G7 leaders not saying a word about this? Yes, they're all they're all servile chatter. What are you talking about? They are all servile to America's interest. And America's interest is to blow up Iran to destabilize Iran to make Iran a failed state. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  Just that explains last night's movement. According to US defense officials who spoke to Reuters, the large scale deployment of roughly 30 aerial refueling tanks with the US Air Force last night to airbase in Europe is meant to allow US President Trump options and handling the escalating war between Israel and Iran. What do you think the role of Egypt lately? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=864.5999999999999s)]
*  The Egyptian government is also a dog to American interests. Were you saying that they would wait for G7 to be underway before attacking? I suspected that if there was going to be American escalation, like America joining offensively, America has already been collaborating with Israel nonstop. But like, if there was a if there was a significant escalation, it would come after G7. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=879.04s)]
*  Limitations limitations on missiles and munitions. So there might be some degree of exhaustion, at least when it comes to missile strikes. The Israelis, of course, have to keep up a fairly exacting amount of refueling to continue the war they've been they've been fighting. And they may not be able to do that, which is one of the reasons I think they're going to be coming soon to the United States and saying, please help us. Please get us out of here. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=903.48s)]

*  ...is flabbergasted that there has been no condemnation against Israel. We haven't seen [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1651.58s)]
*  any international bodies, not even the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1656.98s)]
*  condemn Israel for its actions. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1662.74s)]
*  What about the Iranian public at large, Dorsa? The Iranian people, the average Iranian, how [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1664.1799999999998s)]
*  worried are they today and what's been the impact of these Israeli attacks on their daily [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1669.62s)]
*  lives? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1674.62s)]
*  Well, it's been disrupted for sure. People are extremely worried. You have to remember [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1675.62s)]
*  Iran hasn't seen these kinds of attacks on its soil in at least 37 years. The last time [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1680.34s)]
*  they saw this kind of violence was during the Iran-Iraq war and that ended in 1988. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1687.02s)]
*  Since then there has been no strikes, no airstrikes, no attacks inside Iran on this scale. So the [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1692.9399999999998s)]
*  general population is very much worried and scared and rightfully so. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1700.82s)]
*  Dorsa, thank you very much for that for now. Dorsa Jabari here in the studio with us. I'm [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1705.78s)]
*  fully back to continuing coverage of the Israel-Iran war. We'll continue in just a few minutes [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1710.06s)]
*  here. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1715.3400000000001s)]
*  Trump's threats lost a ton of credibility. No, he was threatening Hamas with all hell [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1716.3400000000001s)]
*  breaks loose if they don't agree to release hostages in 48 hours. This isn't like that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1718.94s)]
*  I feel like this is an entirely different level of, of elevated threat. Also, we were [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1724.22s)]
*  talking about the Iranian attitudes and NPR wrote this really funny statement that John [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1731.26s)]
*  Schwartz made fun of thanks to NPR. Thanks to NPR for explaining that due to the ancient [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1736.82s)]
*  mysterious culture of Persia, Iranians don't like to be attacked. Well, it's not clear. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1741.74s)]
*  I think the most of us, the question is how do either side get out of this? Because the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1745.66s)]
*  danger is that both countries rally around their flags. The Iranian regime is very unpopular, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1749.86s)]
*  but this is a moment where Persian nationalism, which goes back five millennia, people are [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1753.66s)]
*  very proud. They don't like to be attacked. They want to be the ones that decide their [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1757.54s)]
*  future and not to have another country come in and try to dictate what they do, whether [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1761.6200000000001s)]
*  on energy or it's on regional relations or on supporting extremist groups. So this is [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1765.58s)]
*  a moment for the Iranians. That is also an existential challenge improvement. I guess [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1769.86s)]
*  it's an ancient Arab and Persian tradition to like it when thousand ton bombs are dropped [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1774.06s)]
*  on you. Yeah. I guess, I guess the NPR at least says like Iranians due to their proud [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1779.3799999999999s)]
*  tradition of, of 5,000 year history don't appreciate when foreign nations that have [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1788.94s)]
*  been around for 77 years, drop munitions on them. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1795.38s)]
*  Yeah. As opposed to the other type of coverage from Washington pose where they say stuff [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1799.5s)]
*  like Iranians are euphoric to receive bombs from Israel. You know, Edward Said rolling [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1804.78s)]
*  in his gray dude, it's just, why did he even write a book? As Mond really defended us nuking [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1810.54s)]
*  Iran and killing people. I can't really believe it. Why can't you believe it is the most believable [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1818.1799999999998s)]
*  thing by the way, if I were to say that same thing about Tel Aviv, which I would never [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1822.4199999999998s)]
*  say for the record, and we ban people for saying that all the time, I would get banned [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1826.4199999999998s)]
*  instantly, but I have on ironically use this as an example, double standard. Someone can [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1832.26s)]
*  say, someone can say they want to nuke Tehran and kill everyone in it and not receive any [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1838.26s)]
*  penalties whatsoever. It's not even a remote violation of terms of service, even though [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1847.06s)]
*  there's Iranians living in Tehran right now on this platform that are streamers. Okay. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1850.74s)]
*  But if someone were to say the exact same about, if someone were to say the exact same [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1856.02s)]
*  thing about Tel Aviv, you know, you would get, you get banned. Ironically enough, Iran [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1860.1799999999998s)]
*  does not have nukes and Israel does have nukes. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1866.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know how he defended the principle of, of, you know, using nuclear weapons on [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1871.46s)]
*  Tehran. I doubt that he's openly stated it. Like I doubt that he said it as is like when [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1878.9s)]
*  he had the clarity, like the full blown clarity of saying that Palestinians are an inferior [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1885.3000000000002s)]
*  culture that deserved to be a genocide. When he said that he got banned for it. So I think [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1891.0600000000002s)]
*  he knows better than to say something like that openly. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1897.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1901.14s)]
*  Military site is the height of cowardice and a sign of desperation. As some of them, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1904.0200000000002s)]
*  Javed has more. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1909.38s)]
*  This is the moment when Israel attacked Iran state TV during a live broadcast. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1912.98s)]
*  Anyway, hi, we're, this is a repeat. I was continuing, but residents of Tehran, many of [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1921.86s)]
*  them are fleeing the capital city. However, the roads are blocked. Some of them, they [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1935.3s)]
*  run out of fuel because they get stuck in the traffic jam for so many hours. So they [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1940.74s)]
*  cannot even manage to leave the city. So what people are concerned right now is to stockpile [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1945.6999999999998s)]
*  food and find a way to escape Tehran. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1950.42s)]
*  We know, don't we, that there has been unrest between the people and the Iranian regime over [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1953.38s)]
*  the last few years. Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister has been talking about the fact that, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1958.5s)]
*  you know, the people aren't with the regime. Do you get that sense that this might unite [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1964.26s)]
*  the Iranian people? Are we able to get any of that sense? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1970.18s)]
*  I get your point because usually when at a time of war, there is this rally around the flag [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1974.74s)]
*  effect. However, it's, I think, too early to see that what I see and what I, when you talk to [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1979.54s)]
*  people, they just are saying that they have, they're in a state of panic. They're in a state [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1984.5s)]
*  of shock. So to expect Iranians to go on the streets and protest right now, I don't know how [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1989.86s)]
*  realistic that is. That was Param Gabbadi from BBC Persian speaking to me a little earlier. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=1994.34s)]
*  And just to let you know, on the BBC News live page, there are lots more reports. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2000.82s)]
*  Let's get more analysis now from Abbas Aslani, who joins us live from Inside Tehran. He's a [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2005.6200000000001s)]
*  journalist and also a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2011.6200000000001s)]
*  It is great to have you this morning. Thank you for joining us. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2016.18s)]
*  Thank you, Paula, for having me. If we could, just give me a general sense of what you're seeing in [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2021.6200000000001s)]
*  Tehran. What are people telling you? I've read reports that the ferocity of the attacks caught [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2028.18s)]
*  many people by surprise there on Friday. Paula, you know, after the initial shock that came on [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2034.5s)]
*  early Friday morning, Iran tried to recover and we were seeing that the air defense, including [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2040.66s)]
*  into Iran and other cities, were trying to actively engage with the hostile targets coming from the [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2046.98s)]
*  Israeli side or those, let's say drones flying over the sky. And, you know, the feeling this time, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2052.9s)]
*  comparing to previous exchanges in the past between Iran and Israel, is a bit different. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2061.14s)]
*  There's a sense of war going on between the two sides. The high ranking officials are using the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2066.18s)]
*  term war, not, I mean, just a limited conflict between the two sides. And that's why this [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2073.3799999999997s)]
*  situation is a bit more serious. And as of the latest round of attacks from the Israeli side [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2080.1s)]
*  yesterday, which targeted residential complexes and areas, some people in the capital city have [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2087.62s)]
*  been trying to avoid unnecessary commute, but they are doing their normal life. However, they [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2095.06s)]
*  somehow, it seemed that by yesterday attacks, Israel wanted to create a sense of fear and [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2102.58s)]
*  intimidate the population in order to, you know, somehow create a kind of chaos. But government [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2108.34s)]
*  has been trying to handle the situation and in terms of the power, electricity or things like [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2114.5s)]
*  that, water, it's condition. And in the meantime, we have been seeing from the Iranian side that [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2120.58s)]
*  gradually they have been trying to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their attacks [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2127.7s)]
*  against Israel. Specifically last night, they tried to use newer missiles and more [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2133.86s)]
*  missiles reportedly. And the Iranian officials, when they are talking, they have been not talking [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2138.98s)]
*  about a specific time for the end of this conflict, but they, the hint that this might continue in [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2148.02s)]
*  future. And if it continues, it will, you know, become more crushing and it will escalate into a, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2154.66s)]
*  let's say, more complicated situation. And this indicates that, but why is that? Because [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2162.66s)]
*  when we are looking at the public in the country and in the capital city, we are seeing that [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2170.42s)]
*  this external threat coming from the Israeli side and this aggression has made different [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2177.54s)]
*  factions and different types of people to rally around the flag. And I was talking to even some [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2182.98s)]
*  people who are critical of the establishment and the government. They may not agree with the [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2188.82s)]
*  government on many issues and they have been critical of the establishment, but all agree [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2194.5s)]
*  in one thing that Iran needs to have to give a crushing response to Israel to establish a [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2200.42s)]
*  deterrence against any likely or potential attacks or aggression coming from the Israeli side. And [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2206.7400000000002s)]
*  let's say unity among different political factions as well as the ordinary people. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2214.26s)]
*  So it's, and we only have about a minute more of your time here, Abbas. So essentially what [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2221.7000000000003s)]
*  you're hearing from your perspective as a journalist, there does seem to be this wide [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2226.42s)]
*  spread support among Iranians when it comes to that initial preemptive round of strikes that [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2234.1800000000003s)]
*  Iran launched on Israel, if I'm hearing you correct? Yes, you know, this has created a kind [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2240.82s)]
*  of unity among the public supporting the Iranian defense forces and government to retaliate against [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2248.5800000000004s)]
*  Israel. And nobody's buying into Iran that Benjamin Netanyahu is going after Iran's nuclear program [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2257.3s)]
*  because residential areas as well as more than 90% of those victims of the attack have been [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2267.14s)]
*  civilians. And yesterday many people they saw there by their own eyes that ordinary people were [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2276.5s)]
*  targeted. So that's why this has created a unity in the country. And following what happened in [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2282.9s)]
*  Gaza, Israel does not have a good standing among the Iranian public. And this somehow, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2289.3799999999997s)]
*  this recent aggression against Iran has increased the level of unpopularity of Israel among Iranians. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2296.8199999999997s)]
*  That's why we could say that the majority of the Iran [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2304.8999999999996s)]
*  reports indicate aerial activity near the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2310.18s)]
*  And people are supporting that response against Israel and they are demanding for more crushing [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2314.4199999999996s)]
*  response. One is that because they maybe hate the actions by Israel. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2322.26s)]
*  They're trying to establish a deterrence against any likely future attacks. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2327.54s)]
*  Israel's defense minister has vowed, quote, the residents of Tehran will pay the price and soon. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2334.98s)]
*  Now, Israeli officials say at least 23 people have been killed since Iran's retaliation started. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2341.54s)]
*  And Ron, at least 224 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since Friday. And that's [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2346.18s)]
*  according to he's lying. By the way, this guy is on CNN. So the idea that like a CNN commentator [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2352.74s)]
*  would use as an opportunity to not say what you think he should be saying is so funny. Yeah. No, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2360.2599999999998s)]
*  he's lying. Iranians love getting bombed. Iranians actually are, they're, they're massive fans of [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2366.18s)]
*  death and destruction and murder of their family members. Famously white house officials comment [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2374.1s)]
*  on Trump's statement. New Trump social media posts telling Iranians to immediately evacuate Tehran [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2379.38s)]
*  reflected the urgency of need for Iran to come to the negotiating table away to, Oh my God, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2383.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to lose my mind. What is this madness? What is this madness, dude? White house officials [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2388.1s)]
*  say Trump's post urging Tehran evacuation reflects urgency for Iran to come to talks. Oh, that's cool. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2396.3399999999997s)]
*  There's a, I don't know. There's a different way to say that. I think without making it seem like [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2402.5s)]
*  you're just going to nuke Tehran guys. Stop asking if Congress needs to approve any US military action. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2408.42s)]
*  Okay. Please. What are you saying? What are you? Do you hear yourselves? Do you hear yourselves? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2414.34s)]
*  Look at the country. Look at the state of this nation. Stop asking me stupid questions. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2422.98s)]
*  It's like, like, Oh, well, they can't do that. They can't just like black bag American legal [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2428.8999999999996s)]
*  permanent residents for being mean to Israel, a foreign nation. Oh wait, they have been doing that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2434.58s)]
*  Okay. Wait, I'm confused. Are you telling me that America, the American executive leadership, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2440.8199999999997s)]
*  the white house could just single-handedly decide to strike a sovereign nation? Yes. The answer is [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2448.8999999999996s)]
*  yes. The answer is technically no, but nobody gives up. Nobody, especially when it comes to war, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2457.38s)]
*  Democrats don't even give a f**k. Like look at Joe Biden. Joe Biden literally bombed Yemen. Okay. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2463.2200000000003s)]
*  Did he get congressional approval for that? No, he didn't. It didn't matter. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2473.1400000000003s)]
*  Trump did it as well in the first term and Trump did it as well in the second term already. Again, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2477.94s)]
*  bombing Yemen. There is no more or Syria. There's no more. There is no congressional approval. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2482.98s)]
*  Ironically enough, Chuck Schumer, a couple of weeks ago was calling Trump a p**sy for not [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2488.18s)]
*  bombing Iran. Okay. He's like, Oh, it did. Trump is taco. Trump is doing a backdoor to allow them [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2493.62s)]
*  to continue enriching uranium for their nuclear power plants at the civilian level. That's [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2501.14s)]
*  unacceptable. Like, do we forget that? Look at how the New York times framed it. President Trump [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2507.54s)]
*  in a post on true social during the G7 meeting in Canada reiterated his suggestion that Iran had [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2512.82s)]
*  brought Israeli attacks on itself by not heeding his urging to sign a deal to end this nuclear [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2517.7000000000003s)]
*  program. What a shame. What a waste of human life. Trump wrote simply stated. Iraq can not have a [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2522.5s)]
*  nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again. Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2525.86s)]
*  during remarks. The reporter is about an hour earlier. Trump said he believed that Iran is [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2531.46s)]
*  basically at the negotiating table and that he wanted to make a deal. Trump deleted his tweet. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2535.06s)]
*  Wait, what? No, he didn't. Also, why should any country? Why should any country ever trust the [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2540.74s)]
*  word of America ever again, for the rest of time? Like this is happening amidst a denuclearization [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2548.02s)]
*  agreement. Stop saying lies, by the way, that he deleted his tweet or whatever. He did not [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2555.7799999999997s)]
*  delete any of it. I god damn it. This is so this is so lame. To the country's ministry of health, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2561.7799999999997s)]
*  the IDF vowing their strikes will be like a bunch of chatters are just like [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2568.66s)]
*  making shit up. He didn't. It's still there. What? Yeah, it's still on his page. What are you talking [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2573.46s)]
*  about? Dumb fucks. Why are you guys doing this? Come even more intense. And Iran's president says [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2579.54s)]
*  that the country's response will escalate as well. I'm going to start banning evil. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2587.14s)]
*  We will continue to intensify our operations and in doing so, strengthen our security for years [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2592.8199999999997s)]
*  to come. Defending our home front is a crime. If you keep like saying dumb shit, while we're [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2597.78s)]
*  awaiting confirmation of whether or not America's like entering the battle with offensive capabilities. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2604.1000000000004s)]
*  If you do this, if you post shit like this, I will ban you. Yeah, I saw the report. Yes, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2612.1800000000003s)]
*  Trump refused to sign the de escalation thing at the G seven critical component of this campaign. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2618.1800000000003s)]
*  We are by no means seeking to expand the war, but naturally, as our army, our powerful IRGC [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2623.86s)]
*  and our dear people have shown appropriate responses have been given so far. The more [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2630.1s)]
*  they try to escalate naturally, the responses will become tougher and more severe. More innocent [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2635.54s)]
*  people may lose their lives. Chief international security correspondent Nick paid walls joining me [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2641.3s)]
*  live now from London. Nick, it's good to have you this morning. In your view here, where does [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2648.26s)]
*  President Trump fit into this? As the escalation continues to grow, he seems to be both offering [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2653.3s)]
*  peace talks. He also continues to back Israel. So where does this road to potential road for [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2658.82s)]
*  diplomacy land? Yeah, I mean, it's been particularly opaque to work out exactly what the Trump [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2665.5400000000004s)]
*  administration wanted prior to this. And now it appears that they label these Israeli strikes as [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2670.9s)]
*  very successful, exactly what they think their future position may end up being here. But [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2676.58s)]
*  President Trump over the past hours has said that the Iranians are talking, suggested that perhaps [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2682.34s)]
*  there could be a deal here. And I think for the moment now, why it appears that as far as we know [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2687.7s)]
*  publicly, the United States is not materially involved in these Israeli strikes, that they may [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2693.06s)]
*  be holding themselves out as a potential off ramp for some kind of diplomatic de escalation here. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2699.46s)]
*  Now, clearly, there were suggestions overnight to that an Israeli thought to kill the Iranian [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2705.38s)]
*  Supreme Leader at Olajamanay may have been something that was vetoed by the United States. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2711.1400000000003s)]
*  And so there are suggestions potentially that the Trump administration is maybe trying to have it [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2716.34s)]
*  both ways, suggest they have some sense of control or veto power over exactly what Israel does, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2719.78s)]
*  while at the same time aren't necessarily trying to call all the moves here. So Trump, I think, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2725.54s)]
*  to have it both ways, there may be voices around him that are indeed suggesting that as Israel [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2731.06s)]
*  continues to take a remarkable, a devastating toll, frankly, not just on [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2737.14s)]
*  any question, are people justifying backing Israel? I mean, if you ask the public, many people don't [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2740.8999999999996s)]
*  give a fuck about Israel, but if you ask politicians, when have they stopped backing Israel? If you ask [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2745.14s)]
*  the media, when have they stopped backing Israel? If anything, after 19 months of wild Holocaust, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2750.18s)]
*  that was live streamed, there was a brief moment where the media got a new permission structure to [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2756.82s)]
*  finally criticize Israel a little bit only to have that completely reset as soon as what is, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2762.26s)]
*  is it effing again? Mini F tiny F. Okay. Calm down everybody. Only to completely reset on that [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2768.26s)]
*  position. As soon as Israel launched another attack this time against a sovereign nation with an [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2773.46s)]
*  actual, with, with actual targeting and strike capabilities that can actually punish Israel and [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2780.26s)]
*  Israeli society from afar. We have yet to see the Iranian retaliation tonight for the record. I know [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2785.78s)]
*  that they were saying that that was going to happen. A big retaliation was going to happen. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2792.26s)]
*  And the fact that it hasn't happened could mean two things that their capabilities are diminishing [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2796.26s)]
*  or potentially that they were worried about the Trump statement as well. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2802.02s)]
*  It's on Iran's military, but according to Iranian officials on Iranian civilians as well, over 200 [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2807.78s)]
*  killed is crazy though, because you reap what you sow. What do you mean? Brandon moment. What's crazy [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2813.46s)]
*  though, is that like the, I'm losing my mind a little bit. It's talking about Israel. I know [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2821.38s)]
*  he was talking about Israel was crazy is the, the idea that this is all about denuclearization [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2829.46s)]
*  and getting around to the table is a lie. Okay. It has nothing to do with Iran getting nukes. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2836.7400000000002s)]
*  Does America not want Iran to get nukes? Of course. But the reason why America doesn't want [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2842.5s)]
*  Iran to get nukes is because then they can't dominate Iran. The same reason why Israel does [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2846.42s)]
*  not want Iran to get nukes, not because they're going to use it, but the threat of being able to [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2851.94s)]
*  use the nukes would make it impossible for Israel to bomb Tehran in the way that it is currently. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2855.86s)]
*  Nuclear proliferation in the age of nukes simply means you get to have sovereignty. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2861.86s)]
*  Okay. That's all this means. That's it. If Iran had nukes, Israel wouldn't get to fly over [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2867.54s)]
*  and bomb Tehran like this, because the simple threat of Iran deploying nukes to Israel [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2874.7400000000002s)]
*  would be enough for Israel to never behave like this. It would make the region a more stable [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2880.02s)]
*  region. That's why John Mercheimer also says this. Okay. That's it. Having said that the [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2884.34s)]
*  conversation around the conversation around like Iran denuclearization is bullshit. Okay. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2890.34s)]
*  It's bullshit. It's not about Iran denuclearization at all. They want to do [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2896.82s)]
*  enforceable regime change in Iran, and they are not shying away from killing a fuckton of civilians [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2901.54s)]
*  and engaging in direct military action against the incredibly densely populated capital of Iran [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2909.7000000000003s)]
*  to do so. Just like the hostages being released was not a real goal for Israel. Did we forget? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2917.94s)]
*  That's just a talking point. The real goal was ethnic cleansing. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2929.54s)]
*  Hostages, as long as they existed, could be used as a reason to do ethnic cleansing. And once the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2933.7000000000003s)]
*  hostages were on the throes of being completely released, okay, because the remaining hostages [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2940.34s)]
*  are prisoners of war. They're IDF soldiers that were captured. Now Israel doesn't even talk about [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2946.18s)]
*  the hostages. They're there. They don't give a fuck. They're still doing ethnic cleansing. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2953.14s)]
*  The conversation has completely gone away. I wonder why. Because it had nothing to do with [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2957.46s)]
*  releasing the hostages or the prisoners of war at all. It had everything to do with ethnically [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2964.82s)]
*  cleansing the Gaza Strip and completely dominating Gaza Strip and reoccupying the Gaza Strip. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2969.3s)]
*  Iran can't have nukes is a bullshit fucking reason. The real goal here is to dominate [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2975.7s)]
*  the Iranian public and destabilize it permanently, decapitate its leadership, and then [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2982.2599999999998s)]
*  put forth a puppet that they can control. Okay. I can't believe motherfuckers still go, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2986.9s)]
*  bro, Hamas killed the hostages. Israel killed more hostages than Hamas has. What are you talking [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2992.66s)]
*  about? Israel, Israel, Israel is the fucking, Israel is the responsible party here. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=2997.78s)]

*  the civilians of Tehran to immediately evacuate, threatening to bomb Tehran into oblivion. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3054.82s)]
*  He turned around and tweeted about how Tucker Carlson is wrong. Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3062.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh my god. Clown country, utter clown show, complete clown country is a F little F happened. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3069.86s)]
*  Frame drop. I know. I know there's some frame. It's patchy. It's patchy. It's a little bit of [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3077.38s)]
*  frame drops taking place. Tehran 15 million metro area. Los Angeles 13 million metro area. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3083.86s)]
*  Exactly. Iran's been on the brink of having nukes since 1993 when it Nia Hoyoung minister of the [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3090.02s)]
*  Knesset wrote they could acquire a bomb by 1999. Frankly, the goal of regime change I think is no [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3095.38s)]
*  more the primary goal here than it was in Iraq. The sake of the war is war. It brings Israeli [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3100.82s)]
*  society together and it remobilized American military support while the government stays in [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3104.98s)]
*  power and the region continues to suffer. Like I've said a hundred times is a reset button. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3108.9s)]
*  No, it's not just a reset button. The sake of the the sake of blowing up Iran in this final [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3111.94s)]
*  solution against Iran is to envision a different Middle East. Iran is the final spoiler against [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3119.3s)]
*  American ambition of full domination over this oil rich region. If it doesn't happen tomorrow, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3130.5s)]
*  if it doesn't happen today, it was bound to happen in, I don't know, the next fucking 10 years. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3137.22s)]
*  Another Trump post. Tucker Carlson says in his newsletter that Trump is complicit in an act of [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3143.7799999999997s)]
*  war. Many in Trump's magnet movement are not happy. A big chunk of them are isolationists who believe [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3149.8599999999997s)]
*  Trump would end all wars. Another chunk is anti-Israel. Tucker Carlson. This could be the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3154.4199999999996s)]
*  final newsletter before an all out war. US says it was not involved. That's not true. Trump is [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3157.4599999999996s)]
*  complicit in an act of war. America first means many great things, including the fact that Iran [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3162.42s)]
*  can not have a nuclear weapon. Make America great again. I'm sorry. Like why are you even entertaining [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3169.06s)]
*  some fucking MAGA base that's going to get mad at you for bombing Iran, dude? What the fuck is [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3175.06s)]
*  going on? This is our fucking president. This is our future. What we are living through. It's like, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3180.1800000000003s)]
*  this is the possible lamest way to go into World War Three. Joe Rogan, regular, apologizes for [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3185.94s)]
*  supporting Trump calls for impeachment. Oh, Dave Smith, comedian and frequent Joe Rogan guest. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3191.94s)]
*  Dave Smith is apologize for supporting president Donald Trump and is now calling for his impeachment. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3198.42s)]
*  Watch the video on this. They feature you, Jason. Maybe they organically found themselves in this [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3206.34s)]
*  space. And I think the Republican party took advantage of that very well. That doesn't exist [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3212.18s)]
*  on the left. It's not necessarily flooding the market with like a bunch of liberals. Like, oh, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3216.66s)]
*  if we had like eight more pod save Americas that kind of look like me, for example, like more [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3221.54s)]
*  bro-y, right? Then that would be fine. It's like, no, you can't podcast your way out of this problem. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3226.5s)]
*  There was a list that looked at who had the top like election night coverage, who had the most [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3231.14s)]
*  views. And that list was populated exclusively by right wingers, except for me. So I'm out there. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3234.66s)]
*  I'm here. But obviously I'm not directly aligned with the top of the ticket or with many of the [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3239.94s)]
*  establishment Democrats and their attitude towards consistently and stubbornly defending [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3247.38s)]
*  third way neoliberalism. There is a divide here that does not exist within the Republican base [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3252.5s)]
*  of support that will develop a relatively conservative audience. So I think this is an [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3259.2200000000003s)]
*  issue that has to be solved top down. I think first, it's not about like 10 more podcasters or [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3263.62s)]
*  20 more liberal podcasters. I think it's more so about the democratic party looking within and doing [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3269.06s)]
*  is reals using this as a reset button as well. It's not an accident. This was done right before [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3274.26s)]
*  the conference for Europe to recognize Palestine. Israel's using Israel's trying to use Iran's [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3277.7000000000003s)]
*  pariah status among global powers or gain trust and support and stymie the growth of pro-Palestinian [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3282.7400000000002s)]
*  sentiment and policy. No, because the conference recognizing Palestine is meaningless. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3287.5400000000004s)]
*  Like Ireland recognized Palestinian statehood a long time ago, and they still can't even fucking [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3295.1400000000003s)]
*  do BDS against Israel. So that part is just like, that's all messaging. That's all fucking [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3301.46s)]
*  bullshit. The reason why Netanyahu fucking pulled the trigger was because he was worried about [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3307.62s)]
*  internal conflict that would basically make it impossible for them to do this. And who knows [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3313.86s)]
*  when Israel would get the second chance of going after Iran. This is right after all of the Iranian [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3320.18s)]
*  proxies have been diminished with the exception of, I guess, Yemen. All of the Iranian proxies have [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3329.86s)]
*  been either decapitated like Hezbollah and have been diminished in their capacity. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3337.1400000000003s)]
*  The logistical hub of Syria is gone. There is no, there's no way for Iran to surround Israel or [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3342.26s)]
*  present a serious threat to Israel beyond lobbying missiles from fucking Iran directly towards [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3349.6200000000003s)]
*  Israel, which is still fairly consequential. And I think these guys have actually miscalculated. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3354.98s)]
*  Like I think Israel, I think Israel thought that they would be able to withstand Iranian attacks, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3360.9s)]
*  or maybe even take over Iranian capabilities fairly quickly. Take, take out Iranian capabilities [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3368.58s)]
*  fairly quickly. Having said that, however, I think the real reason why they did this now was because [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3374.66s)]
*  if the Knesset dissolved due to not having enough soldiers to continue doing baby cleansing [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3381.7799999999997s)]
*  in fucking Gaza and therefore trying to bring the Haredi population to conscript them forcibly, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3389.3799999999997s)]
*  the Knesset was destined to dissolve. And if that were to happen, they would never, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3396.42s)]
*  they would never be able to take advantage of this current best opportunity to strike Iran. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3402.18s)]
*  That's what I think. Maybe I'm wrong, but that is my assessment. Yeah. President Trump is leaving [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3407.62s)]
*  the G7 summit early, by the way, which is again, not good news. President Trump is leaving the G7 [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3415.54s)]
*  summit early and will return to DC tonight. I think it is pretty funny, however, that the way [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3420.3399999999997s)]
*  that this is being done, like the consent being manufactured against Iran is fucking identical to [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3425.62s)]
*  invading Iraq. Like it is literally identical. The actors are the fucking same. Benjamin Nenyahoo is [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3433.38s)]
*  still saying the same shit, but this time he changed like two letters. Okay. How crazy? I guess not to [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3439.38s)]
*  one letter. I agree with you. 100% of the timing here is just right for Nenyahoo to eliminate Iran [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3447.3s)]
*  as the head of this axis. My point is that while Bibi doesn't want a difficult war, I think he [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3452.1800000000003s)]
*  wants a long one. I mean, sure. I just, I don't think, yeah, one letter, not two anyway, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3455.38s)]
*  president Trump, Caroline Leavitt says president Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3463.7000000000003s)]
*  major trade deal with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer much was accomplished, but because of what's [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3472.9s)]
*  going on in the middle East president trouble with leaving tonight after dinner with heads of state [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3476.7400000000002s)]
*  reads like a daycare report card. Here's the full warning from the IRGC to Israel. Yeah. I saw this. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3481.14s)]
*  The Iranian revolutionary guard corps warns and orders the evacuation of cities. I mean, this is [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3487.06s)]
*  so stupid in the coming hours. The IRGC aerospace force will carry out precise attack against [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3492.74s)]
*  occupied territories. Any city facility or center within the occupied territories would be considered [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3498.02s)]
*  a legitimate target. You must have Lee. Okay. This also features the Gaza strip and even the [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3503.14s)]
*  fucking Golan Heights. What is this? What is this fucking stupid ass? Yeah. They're using the greater [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3509.3s)]
*  Israel map. Nowhere is safe. We are going to bomb the West bank. We are going to bomb Golan Heights. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3517.78s)]
*  We are going to bomb the Gaza strip. It's our time. Sadly, it looks like I was right. Trump [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3525.6200000000003s)]
*  said the launch neocon regime change war against Iran on behalf of Israel. He's done nothing to [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3530.98s)]
*  explain his actions to the American public or even his base because he can't he's forcing [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3534.82s)]
*  Americans to fight Israel's war because he's owned a gigantic U S air force deployment is [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3537.54s)]
*  currently underway. This from yesterday with over 20 aerial refueling tankers moving across the ocean [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3541.86s)]
*  along with many more military assets as Netanyahu pushes Trump to join Israel's war on Iran. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3546.34s)]
*  I'm certain that Trump does not want the U S directly engaged in the war that he fantasized [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3550.66s)]
*  about winning a Nobel peace prize by ending it. And that in any case, he's too mentally lazy to [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3554.34s)]
*  manage such a conflict. I don't think so because if he wanted a Nobel peace prize, he could have [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3558.02s)]
*  literally gotten one by telling Benjamin and the other to stop the genocide. And he never did. It [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3563.3s)]
*  is also clear that his base has no desire to fight any neocon war of choice for Israel. America's [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3567.54s)]
*  first influencers like their calls on an MTG are now escalating the opposition because they know [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3572.02s)]
*  that will sabotage was less of Trump's domestic agenda. But this is the most brandonized presidency. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3575.46s)]
*  This is the most brandonized presidency of all time. This is full Brandon. Trump is going full [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3582.34s)]
*  Brandon, basically fucking slow sleepwalking into more genocide in Gaza and also an even [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3588.98s)]
*  further escalation of conflict in the fucking region. This is literally full Brandonization. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3598.02s)]
*  This is it. Guy who came on Brandon, what did he do? He ran against Trump saying he was the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3603.62s)]
*  reasonable foreign policy leader. He won. He said he was going to be the adult in the room. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3611.14s)]
*  Many people forgot this because of the last year of Brandonization, but quite literally, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3616.42s)]
*  Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020 because he was supposed to be the adult in the room and [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3621.2200000000003s)]
*  bring back all of our allies. Okay. And he did the opposite is his administration was so damaging to [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3626.5s)]
*  the entire premise of the international rule based order. There was no more international rules or [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3636.82s)]
*  laws. It was over, especially because of the glaring hypocrisy that even the dumbest fucking [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3643.46s)]
*  person could see between the way that we moved against Russia versus the way that we moved [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3650.58s)]
*  with Israel. That was huge. Those two things happening in the same leadership made it impossible [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3657.86s)]
*  to fucking hide and say, Oh, well, this is like two different political parties in the way that [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3665.94s)]
*  they fucking react. The situations are different. But it was over at that point. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3669.7s)]
*  And then Trump came in and what did he say? He said he was going to be the peace president. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3673.62s)]
*  He said he was going to actually end the wars. Day one, he said he ran against the Brandon regime [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3678.58s)]
*  and Kamala Harris specifically by claiming that he was a fucking peaceful dove, claiming that he [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3686.34s)]
*  was going to end the wars. He was going to be done with it. No more unnecessary wars, I say. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3692.26s)]
*  I'm going to end both Ukraine and Russia day one and I'm going to end the Israel Palestine [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3696.98s)]
*  situation day one. Okay. That's what he fucking said. What has happened since then? More war. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3702.82s)]
*  Nothing has ended. I'm willing to entertain how much more difficult it is to navigate through [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3710.18s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia because Russia is the responsible party for the invasion and it's a foreign [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3715.86s)]
*  adversary. But with Israel, the ethnic cleansing campaign could have stopped. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3720.18s)]
*  He has all the fucking power. You know how he says, I have no, I have no, you have no cards. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3726.2599999999998s)]
*  You have no cars. The Zelensky, he has all the cars with Israel. He could say that to everything [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3732.5s)]
*  Trump said to Zelensky. He could have literally said to Benjamin Netanyahu, the humiliation that [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3737.46s)]
*  he puts Zelensky through, he could have absolutely put Benjamin Netanyahu through 100%. He could have [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3743.3799999999997s)]
*  done that, but he didn't. He didn't do that at all because he also is a part of the uniparty [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3749.94s)]
*  strategy. Now we're getting double the fucking war, full Brandonization, baby, full fucking [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3757.78s)]
*  Brandon. Now we got fucking tankers and refueling ships. I mean, refueling planes flying in the [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3764.5s)]
*  region. And it feels like there's another aircraft carrier that's moving in that direction too. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3770.98s)]
*  Here's representative fine. God, I hate this fucking piece of shit. Randy fine is one of the [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3777.14s)]
*  biggest monstrous pieces of shit out there. Thank you. POTUS bombs away. Iranian air defenses were [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3782.9s)]
*  activated in the city of Moshe Suleiman. Who's this Don? When does this let them fight thought [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3788.5s)]
*  give? I mean, it's not even a let them fight type situation. Like I think it's crazy that, I mean, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3792.8199999999997s)]
*  there's just, uh, so vice president events declares, we never asked you to go to war unless you [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3798.9s)]
*  absolutely have to at the U S army's 250th anniversary military parade in Washington, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3805.46s)]
*  DC. And so to our soul, we're so proud of you. And let me tell you that the way that we honor [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3810.66s)]
*  and respect you is number one, we never ask you to go to war unless you absolutely have to. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3816.02s)]
*  And number two, when we do ask you to go to war, we give you the weapons and the support needed [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3822.5s)]
*  to kick the hell out of the enemy and come back home safely. The gunshots that we heard [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3827.78s)]
*  weren't gunshots. It was anti-aircraft battery. I think imagine John Bolton's probably pretty sad [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3832.02s)]
*  that he didn't get to be a part of this. No, I don't think he cares. He's still nutting. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3838.98s)]
*  He's still firing off the nuts. He doesn't have to directly be involved. You know what I mean? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3843.62s)]
*  This is his baby coming to fruition here. Let's hear from the Democrats on this global. I continue [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3847.54s)]
*  our conversation right now. Brett McGurk is joining us. Brett McGurk is a Brett McGurk is a [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3853.54s)]
*  responsible party for the, the Brandon White House coordinator. What is happening? Brett McGurk is [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3859.46s)]
*  a responsible party for Brandon's Israel defense. Global affairs analyst. Let's see what he has to [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3867.46s)]
*  say about the Trump administration. I'm sure he's got a lot of smoke for them. Middle East and North [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3873.78s)]
*  Africa. We're seeing Iranian missiles hit central Tel Aviv and Haifa for that matter as well going [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3879.3s)]
*  after oil refinery projects in Haifa. Where do you see all this going? I think if it comes back to [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3885.3s)]
*  one question for me, Fordo, Fordo, Fordo. Fordo is the deeply underground nuclear enrichment facility [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3892.1800000000003s)]
*  buried into a mountain about a half mile underground. That is something the United States [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3897.54s)]
*  can take out. It's something the Israelis will have a lot of difficulty doing. If this ends with [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3902.02s)]
*  Fordo intact, you could actually have a worse problem. You get Iran more inclined to go to [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3906.82s)]
*  nuclear weapon and they have that infrastructure intact. Wait a minute. Wait, I'm so confused. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3913.14s)]
*  Everyone keeps yelling at me saying that the Democrats would be very different than Donald [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3919.7799999999997s)]
*  Trump on this issue. This is so weird. This is here is the former White House coordinator for [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3923.54s)]
*  the MENA region, Brett McGurk, who I believe famously told Israel to strike Lebanon now. Wait, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3930.5s)]
*  but I thought foreign policy wasn't fucking you and a party. What's going on? This is Brandon's [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3938.98s)]
*  guy. This is the guy who was the prime guy. This was basically the fucking Steve Witkoff [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3943.22s)]
*  more than Anthony Blinken. Actually, ironically enough, Marco Rubio and Anthony Blinken would be [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3949.94s)]
*  the analog here and Steve Witkoff and Brett McGurk would be the analog between Trump and Brandon. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3954.58s)]
*  So why is the Steve Witkoff of the Biden administration on CNN [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3960.2599999999998s)]
*  in line with the Trump administration's militancy? Hmm. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3968.1s)]
*  Two ways to deal with Fordo. Number one, a diplomatic deal. I think if the Iranian [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3972.3399999999997s)]
*  foreign minister Abbasarachi called Steve Witkoff, president of President Trump's envoy tomorrow [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3976.5s)]
*  or today and said, hey, let's sit down on the deal you put down a month ago. Remember, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3981.14s)]
*  basically get rid of the risk of an Iranian nuclear weapon. I think that this war would stop. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3986.1s)]
*  The second way to take out Fordo is a military operation. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3991.86s)]
*  Wow. Wow, that's even better. Fordo is the Iranian deep underground nuclear facility. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=3995.54s)]
*  Israel currently does not have the tech to be able to bomb it. Their bombs simply do not reach [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4003.78s)]
*  that deep. Okay. America is one of the only allied countries to Israel that has the, the, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4010.66s)]
*  the Moab style bunker buster bombs that they could potentially deploy to blow it up. They need a B2 [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4019.06s)]
*  bomber. And it's weird because here you have Biden's got even for the record, like even it's not a [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4026.58s)]
*  guarantee that even like American munitions could actually hit it open presence. Thank you for the [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4034.02s)]
*  50 big ones, the 50 bones. Okay. It is super deep underground. The earth still reigns supreme [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4038.5s)]
*  when it comes to withstanding explosive ordinance. Okay. So I just I'm confused because everyone [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4046.98s)]
*  keeps saying that this straw manning is where the left loses me this straw manning. I heard this, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4055.22s)]
*  who said the Democrats are different on this issue? Who said that we said domestic? Have you ever [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4060.42s)]
*  heard me say that the Democrats are, are in lockstep with the Republicans on domestic? No, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4064.9s)]
*  I always say the Democrats follow the past four years of the Republican administration. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4071.54s)]
*  They're marginally better on domestic issues. That's not a straw man. Dumb. There are plenty [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4078.02s)]
*  of people who have been yelling at me since the beginning of this administration, every single [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4083.86s)]
*  fucking day, every single goddamn day about how the Democrats and Republicans are not uniparty. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4087.54s)]
*  Ironically enough, the Obama plan is one of the few instances that I point to, to talk about how [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4095.22s)]
*  the Democrats actually, if left to the rest of the Democrats, they wouldn't have ever continued [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4101.22s)]
*  with the Obama plan. But yes, the Obama denuclearization agreement was good. That is [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4105.86s)]
*  the signature accomplishment of the Obama administration. I've said that. So you're wrong. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4110.34s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. It's no, I'm not wrong about the uniparty. Chuck Schumer was [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4115.54s)]
*  against the fucking denuclearization agreement. You dumbass. The fuck are you talking about? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4124.26s)]
*  There are going to be every now and then some differences, but ultimately it is directionally [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4128.9s)]
*  the same. Okay. You are so fucking stupid. You literally just said, you literally said, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4134.98s)]
*  I heard this, who said the Democrats were different on this issue? And then went, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4142.02s)]
*  well, what about Obama's plan? Where is Obama's plan? It's gone. Why didn't Biden bring it back? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4144.9800000000005s)]
*  Biden was Obama's vice president. Why didn't, why didn't Joseph Robinette Brandon, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4151.9400000000005s)]
*  why didn't Joseph Robinette Brandon bring back the Iran denuclearization agreement because of Trump? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4158.5s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize for the first three fucking years of the Biden administration, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4165.3s)]
*  Donald Trump was actually running for president because of Trump. He couldn't, there were no [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4170.58s)]
*  relations. That's not true. That's fucking bullshit. You are wrong. Biden even hired some of the same [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4175.7s)]
*  people that Obama had initially to restart talks with Iran. Why didn't they follow through on it? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4181.46s)]
*  Trump destroyed our ability to negotiate. Oh, get the fuck out of here, dude. So why is Biden's [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4188.66s)]
*  fucking literal men, a region director who was responsible for their entire middle Eastern [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4193.78s)]
*  operations over here saying, we got a bomb fordo then. Is that also because of Trump? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4199.06s)]
*  Is that also because of Trump? Some of you guys will move the goalpost wildly, will swing it [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4203.9400000000005s)]
*  around wildly with the hopes of defending the least popular party in this country, less popular [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4209.3s)]
*  than even the Republicans. And the Republicans are also deeply unpopular. I don't understand why. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4215.780000000001s)]
*  Do you work for the Democratic party? Is this what your job relies on? Do you get fucking pay stubs? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4220.1s)]
*  Like what is happening here? It doesn't make sense. What is this defense of a falsehood? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4224.9s)]
*  You sound like a fucking QAnon supporter. Nope. My family's being deported. My family's being hurt. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4229.86s)]
*  Dude, don't ever fucking come in here and act like I haven't been screaming about the Democrats and [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4236.82s)]
*  their refusal to fucking defend undocumented migrants. When Kamala Harris literally repackaged, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4244.0199999999995s)]
*  repackaged the fucking 2020 Trump campaign, basically adopting the right-wing framework [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4250.660000000001s)]
*  that migrants were actually a criminal element in this country that needed to be forcibly removed. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4260.42s)]
*  That's what the Democrats did for your family. So go fucking yell at them instead of trying to [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4267.700000000001s)]
*  yell at me, you dumb fuck. God damn. She would have taken their work visas. Maybe, maybe. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4273.06s)]
*  Do you really want to use your fucking family's work visas as a, as a own here in this circumstance [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4280.26s)]
*  to go to one of the fucking only outlets that is defending unconditionally undocumented migrants? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4286.740000000001s)]
*  Really? I'm your enemy, huh? The Democrats, they're your friends. I'm your fucking enemy [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4291.540000000001s)]
*  for yelling at the Democrats for not even fucking protecting the migrants. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4296.34s)]
*  You are so fucking stupid and so fucking brain broken, dude. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4300.5s)]
*  Go take it up with the rest of the fucking libtards in your stupid fucking circles that [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4304.1s)]
*  you spend time in online that celebrate, that salivate at the notion of, well, you know, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4310.1s)]
*  they deserve it. They deserve it. They didn't sufficiently vote for Kamala Harris. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4315.38s)]
*  Huh? Nope. You're wrong here. Oh my God. Oh my God. We, we deserve, we deserve everything [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4321.14s)]
*  that's coming for us. I swear to God, we all deserve it. Fuck. I'm in my office helping [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4328.02s)]
*  with the immigration. I see the pain. Yeah. You see the pain. Make sure you figure out whether or [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4334.18s)]
*  not the people whose families have been sufficiently in support of Kamala Harris. Next time you're [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4338.42s)]
*  fucking processing someone's like deportation order, trying to fight against that. Okay. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4342.34s)]
*  Cause if there have immediate family members that have fucking voted for Donald Trump, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4347.3s)]
*  you should probably allow them to be expeditiously deported instead of fucking defending them. Then [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4350.900000000001s)]
*  I don't do that, which is the straw man. I don't know what you fucking do. All I can say is you [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4355.78s)]
*  are so firmly committed and invested to defending the democratic party that you move the goalpost [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4360.42s)]
*  to immigration, which again is a fucking weakness for the Democrats. And it's only a weakness [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4365.0599999999995s)]
*  because they never defended migrants because they don't give a fuck about the migrants beyond a [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4370.58s)]
*  talking point. And the quicker you as an independent voter realize that and demand change from your own [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4374.82s)]
*  fucking elected representatives, instead of coming to a fucking person who actually does [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4380.66s)]
*  have a real commitment to fucking defending migrants, the better this will be for you, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4385.22s)]
*  the more productive it will be for you. You stupid fucking moron. Democrats are also [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4389.3s)]
*  responsible for all of the fucking awfulness that migrants are experiencing right now. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4394.26s)]
*  They normalize the sentiment. I've been begging since 2021 for the Biden administration to [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4398.9s)]
*  actually develop a counter message to get ahead of this problem before the Republicans use it. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4405.54s)]
*  I've been saying it for the past 10 years, but especially detailing exactly how things were [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4410.26s)]
*  going to unfold for migrants. If the Biden administration didn't quickly follow through [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4415.06s)]
*  on their fucking promises of amnesty for migrants, keeping them in undocumented limbo, instead of [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4419.46s)]
*  keeping them in undocumented limbo to actually go after and tackle this problem and counter [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4426.5s)]
*  message aggressively. And they didn't do that. And what did they do instead? Waited out three [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4431.22s)]
*  fucking years, allowed this problem to fucking fester, allow the Republicans the message about [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4435.9400000000005s)]
*  how migrants are fucking eating cats and dogs like your Haitian relatives are eating cats and [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4440.02s)]
*  dogs is what the Republicans said in order to win the election. And the Democrats even at that point [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4444.18s)]
*  couldn't turn around and be like, this is insane. This is that migrants are not actually responsible [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4450.1s)]
*  for crimes in this country. Okay, holy fuck. If you cannot at this point realize that when the [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4455.46s)]
*  counterbalance, the counter message and the counter mechanism that is supposed to be in place against [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4462.1s)]
*  growing fascism in this country is the Democratic Party, and they've dropped the ball in spectacular [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4467.62s)]
*  fashion when it comes to every single issue, including but not limited to even migrants, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4471.22s)]
*  turning around and basically admitting that the Republicans are right and that the migrants do [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4476.82s)]
*  constitute a national security threat, which is exactly what the Democrats did. October 6th [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4483.22s)]
*  is when Biden came out before October 7, one day before October 7, Biden came out and said, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4487.62s)]
*  we are also going to build a right wing, we're going to build the wall. We're going to build [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4492.18s)]
*  a right wing piece of legislation to combat the crimes that migrants are committing in this country. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4496.18s)]
*  That was fucking bullshit. That was never real, but they conceded on the right wing framing. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4502.34s)]
*  And a big part of the reason why this issue became a 60 40 issue, 60% in favor of fucking mass [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4507.3s)]
*  deportation, as opposed to amnesty was because the Democrats also admitted on their side that this [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4512.5s)]
*  was actually a real national security problem for the first time ever in contemporary Democratic [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4518.900000000001s)]
*  Party history. For the first time ever, Democrats literally came out and said, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4525.14s)]
*  undocumented migrants are actually constituting a fucking national security problem. They gave [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4529.780000000001s)]
*  ground but wouldn't take work visas. You are such a fucking moron, dude. You are such a fucking donkey [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4535.38s)]
*  who gives a fuck if the Democrats would offer temporary work visas while simultaneously [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4542.18s)]
*  literally admitting a false that the Republicans had presented that they are actually a fucking [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4548.18s)]
*  national security threat. They are pushing the needle in the direction of mass deportation, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4553.38s)]
*  and the Democrats are not fighting against it. So of course, Americans are going to start believing [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4559.06s)]
*  that they are actually fucking criminals. This is my point. Also, you said you have your Haitian. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4563.14s)]
*  I don't know if you're also Haitians or if you're Haitian or you're working with Haitians in the [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4569.3s)]

*  angry at me. You'd be angry at the Democrats altogether. What the fuck is this? That's not [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4581.54s)]
*  a leap. I've never met a lived up immigration attorney that doesn't actually fucking criticize [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4586.18s)]
*  the Democrats and their failures on migration. Maybe you are the one fucking person. Anyway, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4591.3s)]
*  I'm done with you. Suck my dick. Yeah, Biden was so good on the Haitian migrants. Remember? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4597.06s)]
*  Actually, you know what? I'm going to unban that person because I want them to address this shit [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4601.94s)]
*  too. What was the fucking account username? Chat. So what he has asked all of us to convey clearly [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4605.22s)]

*  That was the big problem, not our white nativist immigration policies. It was the horses. We're [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4626.900000000001s)]
*  going to punish the person for using the reins as a whip because that's unacceptable protocol. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4633.14s)]
*  Maybe you're missing the forest for the trees there a little bit. It's not that people are [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4637.7s)]

*  It's definitely a bad part of it, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The real good stuff is the [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4647.54s)]
*  horrifying immigration policy that dictates that 690,000 people that were seeking asylum were purged [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4652.820000000001s)]

*  to get legal paperwork done so they could even fucking try to seek asylum here. Okay, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4667.219999999999s)]

*  More than 1,400 Haitians have been deported since Sunday. Meanwhile, in Washington, members of the [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=4693.299999999999s)]

*  on the trip with President Trump is the Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5037.3s)]
*  Dumbass Kay Hyvers. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5040.900000000001s)]
*  I told you he's been briefing him throughout the day on the latest and the updates that we've been [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5041.3s)]

*  Benjamin Netanyahu. And so everyone is watching obviously what is happening in the Middle East [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5049.46s)]
*  and also why the president's cutting his trip short, his trip here early short is making such [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5053.860000000001s)]

*  had heard from Iranian state media... [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5084.74s)]
*  I think these people have no capacity to like analyze the world as events are unfolding [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5087.22s)]
*  without trying to get a phone. This is inherently reactionary. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5093.46s)]

*  person that is your enemy that you must own at all costs. Like you have no substance to your [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5105.14s)]
*  commentary. You have no worldview. You are just simply moving along with the I told you so [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5110.5s)]

*  It's so crazy. The idea that like, well, imagine if we had Harris right now, we wouldn't be in war. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5133.94s)]

*  opportunity. We'd be so we'd be so hard defending Israel right now. And these morons still go [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5166.9s)]
*  Kamala would have never done this. Let it go. Let it go. Drop it. Please. I don't want to I don't [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5172.0199999999995s)]
*  want to argue with dipshits that have this kind of opinion right now. In this like time of [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5178.5s)]
*  unprecedented danger that Kamala Harris would certainly also be on board with. Waltz was [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5183.46s)]
*  significantly more progressive than Kamala. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5190.34s)]
*  The nuclear. Jesus Christ. That remains. And unless the US is involved, it's a real question [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5193.860000000001s)]
*  whether or not they can actually take out both of these Iranian nuclear facilities. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5202.74s)]
*  And it's interesting Anderson, you know, when you talk to people here about fucking aerospace [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5210.02s)]
*  engineer, but he has the IQ of a fucking plankton, dude. He opens the door and revs the engine to [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5215.14s)]
*  his fucking dual sport literally outside of the fucking house, like right next to me. I can smell [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5221.22s)]
*  the fucking fumes. I'm losing my fucking mind. I don't know why he has to always use industrial [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5227.9400000000005s)]
*  equipment or loud sounding fucking motorbikes right next to me with the fucking door open. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5233.9400000000005s)]
*  And processes of progress has already been made in that endeavor. But if the objective is to [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5240.98s)]
*  completely dismantle it to ensure that it can never be resurrected, that seems to indicate that [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5250.339999999999s)]
*  regime change is really the desired outcome here. Not clear how that would transpire or what that [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5256.5s)]
*  would look like. But certainly that is raising a lot of anxiety, Anderson, across this entire region. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5263.62s)]
*  Kirsten Ward, thanks very much. We're going to check back in with you later on in this hour. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5270.5s)]
*  I want to get perspective now from CNN Global Affairs Analyst, Brett McGurk, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5274.5s)]
*  former Middle East and North Africa coordinator for the National Security Council, also retired [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5277.62s)]
*  U.S. Army Colonel Pete Mansour, senior fellow at the Mershon Center for International Security [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5282.099999999999s)]
*  Studies at Ohio State University. Colonel, first of all, what's your read on the president's social [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5287.299999999999s)]
*  media post calling for the evacuation of Tehran? Do you think that is an indication that the United [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5291.379999999999s)]
*  States is going to get directly involved in this? It certainly seems that way. You know, I didn't [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5296.66s)]
*  really think the United States would get involved unless it was attacked in the region by Iran. But [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5302.18s)]
*  with the president returning a day early from the G7, there's really no reason for him to do that if [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5307.78s)]
*  he's just monitoring the situation. He can do that up in Calgary. So I think this may be tipping the [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5313.54s)]
*  hand that the United States might weigh in with in a military sense to complete the job that the [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5319.78s)]
*  Israelis have started. Brett, do you agree with that? That this seems to be an indication of [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5325.62s)]
*  something? As Brett McGurk. I think there's two things going on here, Anderson, and both are [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5330.0199999999995s)]
*  linked. I think we are moving our military assets into place to be able to do a strike into Iran, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5333.86s)]
*  particularly to take out that Fordo facility deeply underground, something really only the U.S. can do. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5339.54s)]
*  But secondly, there's still an off ramp on diplomacy. This is coercive diplomacy, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5344.58s)]
*  what you're seeing. Oh, dude, yeah. Basically, the White House believes they put a deal down [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5348.98s)]
*  to the Iranians about six weeks ago that is a good, fair deal. The Iranians really never [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5353.46s)]
*  responded to that. In fact, they escalated their program in response to that. And basically, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5358.18s)]
*  I think the view is if Abbas Arachi, the former minister of Iran, calls Steve Wittkopf, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5362.9800000000005s)]
*  who is President Trump's envoy, and says, you know what, I re-looked at the deal you put down, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5368.26s)]
*  I'm ready to take it, that's the off ramp. If Iran does not do that, I think we're actually, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5372.02s)]
*  it seems like the U.S. is putting everything in place to get directly involved militarily. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5378.02s)]
*  One way or the other, it's very clear here, I think Iran cannot be left at the end of this [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5383.9400000000005s)]
*  with that enrichment program in place at Fordo. Natanz is the other one. The Israelis have hit [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5388.34s)]
*  that. And then you have the conversion facility. This is part of the fuel cycle at Esfahan, which [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5393.9400000000005s)]
*  has also been hit. But Fordo, Fordo, Fordo, that is the key. And if you don't dismantle Fordo at [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5398.9800000000005s)]
*  the end of this, as you said, Anderson, not only does Iran have the know-how, they have an underground [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5403.94s)]
*  facility with about 10 cascades of very advanced centrifuges, and then you're kind of in an even [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5409.139999999999s)]
*  worse position. So this is really coming to a head fast. It's unprecedented. If anybody says they know [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5414.0199999999995s)]
*  where this is going, they don't know what they're talking about. But I see putting the military [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5419.7s)]
*  pieces in place, that's smart, as you have a diplomatic off ramp. So, you know, let's hope [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5424.0199999999995s)]
*  Iran decides to take that off ramp. Otherwise, I think we're possibly looking for looking to [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5430.26s)]
*  an American strike at Fordo. Colonel, do you have a sense of how long it takes to get U.S. assets [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5435.46s)]
*  in place? I mean, we're talking about, you know, battleships and other assets. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5440.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, we're really talking B-2 bombers and other aircraft like the B-1 that can carry the kind of [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5447.46s)]
*  weapons that could penetrate the mountain at Fordo and destroy it. You know, some of those [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5454.26s)]
*  systems are already in place. They're at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. They're at Gutter, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5460.18s)]
*  and they can fly from Whiteberry for that matter. So we have the capability now to strike Fordo. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5464.5s)]
*  It's just a matter of giving the word. Brett, as we said, Tehran is home to more than 9 million [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5470.66s)]
*  people. Obviously, a complete evacuation of a city of 9 million people is a difficult thing, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5477.06s)]
*  particularly if there's, you know, incoming fire. And at the same time, we heard from Israel, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5483.86s)]
*  from Netanyahu, the idea of Iranians rising up and overthrowing. Did you kill your brother? No, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5490.82s)]
*  he escaped on a motorcycle. That seems a difficult, I mean, obviously there have, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5495.86s)]
*  we've seen demonstrations before. There's clearly a lot of animus toward the regime, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5500.259999999999s)]
*  a lot of dissatisfaction. There's a lot of different ethnic groups as well. But rising up [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5504.58s)]
*  while under bombardment, that seems a contradictory thing. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5511.62s)]
*  Now, if I were the president, if I were advising the president, I would say you got to keep the [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5516.5s)]
*  Israelis avoid mission creep here. The declared objectives of the Israelis are the nuclear program [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5520.099999999999s)]
*  and the missile program. If by taking those out, you wind up with a regime change scenario, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5526.34s)]
*  that's one thing. Guys, there's a lot of diversity of opinion here. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5531.7s)]
*  Regime change. On the fucking CNN panel. I would not try to go down that road. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5534.34s)]
*  Keep the mission focused, align your ends and means. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5541.22s)]
*  Big, big diversity in the panel here. How much do we bomb Iran? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5544.34s)]
*  Mission creep scenario. You get into massive unintended consequences, don't know where that's [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5548.1s)]
*  going. I think you want to have an endpoint. Again, align the military resources, have a [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5552.26s)]
*  diplomatic off ramp. I can see that's what the White House here is trying to do. But it's very, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5556.66s)]
*  very unclear where this is heading tonight. Colonel, you would agree with that given [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5562.58s)]
*  experiences in Iraq and other places, regime change should not be in your estimation part of. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5567.38s)]
*  He told me he had headphones on so he couldn't hear me. He had AirPods in, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5574.9s)]
*  so he couldn't hear me yelling at him. Iranian people to rise up, but they're leaving the [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5581.46s)]
*  one city that matters. If they're going to rise up, it's going to take months or years before that [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5587.38s)]
*  happens. If there's to be regime change in Iran today, it's going to have to come from within [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5592.5s)]
*  in some sort of coup. And I don't think the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are going to [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5598.66s)]
*  assassinate the Ayatollah. So I agree with Ambassador McGurk. Stay on target, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5604.26s)]
*  destroy the nuclear program and the missile program. And then you've defanged Iran and you've [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5611.78s)]
*  already defanged its proxies around the region. And then the region is in a much better position [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5618.26s)]
*  going forward. Peter Munsoor, Colonel, thank you very much. Brett McGurk as well. More now on the [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5624.58s)]
*  kind of day this has been. You're seen in Nick Payton Walsh with that. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5630.74s)]
*  Mid-broadcast, the conflict came to the— What the fuck? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5638.74s)]
*  Calling for a military coup on CNN. Yeah. I mean, Americans are the, this makes sense. This is how [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5642.74s)]
*  America is. Are we on ironically talking about assassinating the head of state of another country? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5650.98s)]
*  Yes. Yes, they are. Like they're also fantasizing about like the Iranians moving to the mountain [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5663.14s)]
*  side away from Tehran only to return to fucking do regime change. I've always said Fox news for [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5675.38s)]

*  Trump ran against Hillary Clinton successfully by positioning himself as as against the Iraq war. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5820.42s)]
*  That was a bad war. It was a shitty war. We should have never entertained it. We lied to go into it. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5829.22s)]

*  24 hours a day, including since Israel's operation rising line began. General Jack Keene, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5957.78s)]

*  he claims to help Israel destroy completely this nuclear enterprise. And Fordow sits out there [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5969.94s)]
*  as a potential target that Israeli is challenged by. It's not that they don't have imagination. It's [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5978.34s)]
*  not that they couldn't do some surprising things. None of that certainly would be off the table, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5983.78s)]
*  but the guarantee is to for the United States to use its penetration bombing to take that side [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=5991.139999999999s)]

*  Israeli society that says 50% of Israeli society believes that Fox news is not sufficiently pro [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6014.82s)]

*  Fordow is a half mile buried inside of a mountain and you believe the United States has no choice [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6051.7s)]
*  but to get involved with the Iranians? Explain that, sir. Well, it's in the United States core [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6059.46s)]
*  national interest that Iran does not have a nuclear capability and get to it. That, that's a fact. And [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6064.5s)]
*  this, this capability, if we, if we leave it there, the Ayatollah will recover and rebuild. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6071.62s)]

*  has a chance. And that's what these guys are all about. And for all the chatters who were too young [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6087.22s)]
*  and never read in history books, how America massaged the narrative to go to war in Iraq, [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6095.9400000000005s)]

*  language. And we've got to, we, we've got to finish what we started here. We can't, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6125.3s)]

*  definitely have to go to war with Iran. Asked us to fight their war answer. No. Is this another [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6217.38s)]
*  Iraq or is it something entirely different? Well, let me tell you what makes this moment unlike [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6224.26s)]
*  anything else we have faced before. First, this was not a call to war. This was not a land invasion. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6230.900000000001s)]
*  This, this, this is not a campaign to topple a regime and then sit around for 20 years, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6237.86s)]
*  trying to rebuild a culture that doesn't want what we have. Even though Iran, the Iranian people are [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6242.1s)]

*  Shiite Islam that believes not just in the return of the messianic figure called the Mahadi, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6305.94s)]

*  to do that is to quote, using their words, wash the world in blood. Okay, I think I'm out at that. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsJeOeS8o9Q&t=6318.9s)]
