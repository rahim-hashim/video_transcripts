# Governor Firebombing Motive Revealed | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc)
*  You think he had mental clarity during the free Palestine part of this conversation and then just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=0.0s)]
*  completely collapsed on the rest of it? Or do you think legitimately Josh Shapiro also is not only, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=5.36s)]
*  you know, in his mind genuinely, this is his mind is clear. He's not experiencing episode. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=14.56s)]
*  Um, and, and, uh, he thinks Josh Shapiro sincerely is like, uh, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=21.36s)]
*  a, uh, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=25.28s)]
*  911. What's the address of the emergency? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=32.0s)]
*  I don't really have an emergency. I would like to apply. Um, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  governor Josh Shapiro needs to know that Cody Ballmer will not take part in his plans for what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=42.32s)]
*  he wants to do to the Palestinian people. He needs to leave my family alone. He needs to get his eyes [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  off of my daughters. Wow. This guy seems to be an ideologically minded person and definitely [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=54.0s)]
*  not experiencing a, a bout of paranoia born out of them taking, uh, not taking their medication. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=61.2s)]
*  You know, this is the, um, 911 call of the arson suspect that is basically confessing in this 911 [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=71.12s)]
*  call that he Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro's residence, the governor's mansion in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=81.44s)]
*  When this initially happened, when this initially took place, I thought it was a strange, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=88.64s)]
*  uh, I thought it was a strange act considering that like there's definitely amongst people who are, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=94.16s)]
*  uh, following closely American politics. Like I'm sure, especially in Pennsylvania, there's like [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=99.84s)]
*  Josh Shapiro has fallen out of favor, but he is far from like, I would say he's far from the biggest [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=104.24s)]
*  villain, uh, especially for someone who is, um, uh, pro Palestine, right? Like John Fetterman, I think [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=108.96s)]
*  is a, is seen as a figure that draws infinitely more ire due to the way he talks about Palestinians [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  due to like his, uh, ridiculous, uh, display of fealty to Israel. So Josh Shapiro on the other hand, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=125.28s)]
*  despite, you know, writing an article when he was in high school about and how Arabs are genetically, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=137.44s)]
*  uh, predisposition to be barbaric or whatever. And that's why Israel has to wipe him out. Like, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=143.2s)]
*  that came out when he ran, uh, when he was a contender for the vice presidential nod, he is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=149.04s)]
*  far from the most infamous figure amongst the free Palestine movement in general. So I thought the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=154.56s)]
*  target was weird, which is part of the reason why I thought I suspected that this could have been [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=163.44s)]
*  an anti-Semitic attack given the timing of it as well during Passover and because Josh Shapiro [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=167.84s)]
*  is Jewish. Now we find out that he's just, I mean, this corresponds to the things that his, uh, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=174.32s)]
*  it was at his mother or his wife, I think her his ex-wife that had revealed to the authorities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=179.92s)]
*  I think it was a might've been his mom. I agree with Shapiro did a bomb that signing that went [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=185.2s)]
*  viral. No, dude, put yourself in the mind of a normie. The reason why I'm mentioning this is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=189.84s)]
*  because especially paired up with all the other stuff that, uh, other stuff that has come out, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=197.44s)]
*  including the 911 call, the, the reasoning for why Josh Shapiro became the target of his ire is, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=204.56s)]
*  or the reasoning for why he took action like this is because he was off his medication. I mean, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to reveal too much, but let me tell you something. I'm quite familiar with people who [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=215.44s)]
*  talk like this. As a matter of fact, many Twitch streamers would probably tell you that they're [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=220.56s)]
*  familiar with people who talk like this. And ironically, I banned someone earlier who was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=225.2s)]
*  talking just like this. I'm not a psychiatrist. I'm not a psychologist, but given my own personal [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=230.32s)]
*  experience, uh, with people that believe that they know that they're being gang stalked or think that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=238.24s)]
*  they know the person, uh, a person that is, uh, you know, that they've seen on television only, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=245.36s)]
*  it comes across as like a schizophrenic, uh, person experiencing, um, hallucinations like [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  paranoid delusions, considering that he thinks Josh Shapiro is coming after and has eyes on his [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=260.16s)]
*  daughters and things of that nature. It feels as though he thought Josh Shapiro was personally [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=266.16s)]
*  targeting him. It has the hallmark of a psychotic attack. So much so that I am very personally [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=272.32s)]
*  familiar with this kind of statement, these kinds of statements. Um, unfortunately, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  and he needs to stop having my friends killed. Like he killed, had many, or last week on Saturday, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=286.88s)]
*  our people have been put through too much by that monster. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=293.84s)]
*  Yeah. All he has is a banquet hall to clean. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=296.4s)]
*  Yeah. He's not talking about like, this is not him being figurative, but he's not making, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=302.4s)]
*  um, he, in his mind, he's being literal. He's not, this isn't him being like, Oh, I meant like, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=309.2s)]
*  get your eyes off my daughters. As in like, you're going to, you're taking actions, uh, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=316.56s)]
*  in the state of Pennsylvania that, uh, end up harming my daughters. He means like literally [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=321.84s)]
*  in his mind, he thinks Josh Shapiro is personally coming after him and his friends. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=333.67999999999995s)]
*  Enough. I'm tired of offering extensions of peace. I only want to be able to provide for my children. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  I should not be taken to these extremes. It's not fair. I wish no harm onto anyone, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  but that man, that man, he is doing serious, serious harm to probably yourself included. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=347.76s)]
*  And I do wish you the best, sir. You all know where to find me. I'm not hiding and I will [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=356.88s)]
*  confess to everything that I had done. Now to the chilling 911 call. Authorities say it was made [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=361.44s)]
*  shortly after the attack on the Pennsylvania governor's residence. ABC's Morgan Norwood joined [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=368.88s)]
*  us now in Morgan. Police say that the call came from the man accused in that fire bombing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Janae. And less than an hour after flames tore through the Pennsylvania [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=379.52s)]
*  governor's mansion, the suspect made that chilling move calling 911 to confess. He was calm, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=383.2s)]
*  almost detached and then ranted about the war in Gaza. And this morning that 911 call is now a key [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=388.56s)]
*  part of that massive investigation. You all know where to find me. I'm not hiding and I will [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  confess to everything that I had done this morning. The chilling confession police say is from the man [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=400.64s)]
*  who allegedly governor Josh Shapiro's Pennsylvania home. 911. What's the address of the emergency? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=406.4s)]
*  I don't really have an emergency. I would like to apologize. In less than an hour after the attack, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=414.08s)]
*  authorities say 38 year old Cody Balmer calmly called 911 heard in this newly obtained audio. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=420.24s)]
*  My favorite is this community specifically and their tendency to hear someone very clearly [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=426.96s)]
*  experiencing a mental health episode and to try and find logic in it. Like this happens all the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=434.24s)]
*  time. A gray name will come in here and be like, you've been, you've kidnapped me 55 times. Hassan [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=440.56s)]
*  piker, the people will know your crimes. Everyone will know how you kidnapped me and how you stalk [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=446.72s)]
*  me every day. And there will be like eight other chatters. I'd be like, what? I can't believe you've [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=452.8s)]
*  done that to that other person. How could you do such a thing? And they're not joking when they say [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=457.92s)]
*  that they literally they're being sincere. I like that it's happening in this instance as well. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=463.52s)]
*  No matter who is very clearly experiencing a breakdown, people would just go, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=470.16s)]
*  hold up. Here's the logic behind it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=478.88s)]
*  ...and describing his as related to the war in Gaza, calling Shapiro who favors a two state [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=481.92s)]
*  solution, a monster. Governor Josh Shapiro needs to know that Cody Balmer will not take [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=488.16s)]
*  part in his plan for what he [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  the Palestinian part of this is literally the only part that the media is focusing on. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=502.23999999999995s)]
*  Like you mean, dude, you think this guy literally was like, I'm doing this, the free Palestine. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=513.04s)]
*  You think that was going on? What about all the other shit that he said about how [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=519.68s)]
*  Josh Shapiro is personally stalking my daughters and trying to kill them or some shit. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=523.36s)]
*  You think he had mental clarity during the free Palestine part of this conversation [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=537.04s)]
*  and then just completely collapsed on the rest of it? Or do you think [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=541.76s)]
*  ...legitimately, Josh Shapiro also is not only, you know, in his mind, genuinely, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=546.0s)]
*  this is his mind is clear. He's not experiencing a episode. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=553.12s)]
*  And he thinks Josh Shapiro sincerely is like a anti-Palestine. And that's why he's taking action. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=559.12s)]
*  Just like he, just like Josh Shapiro may or may not have kidnapped his daughters. Like, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=563.52s)]
*  what do you think he wants to do to the Palestinian people? All he has is a banquet hall to clean up. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  The brazen attack happened just hours after the Shapiro family hosted more than two dozen people [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=573.76s)]
*  for the first night of Passover. When police say the suspect hopped a fence at the governor's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=579.52s)]
*  mansion, broke windows and thrills made from beer bottles and gasoline. No one was injured in the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=584.08s)]
*  attack. In an exclusive interview, ABC's George Stephanopoulos asking the governor whether this [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=590.56s)]
*  was a hate crime. I recognize when you're in these positions of power, there are people out there that [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=596.24s)]
*  want to do you harm. I try not to be captive to the fear and I try not to worry or think about [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=604.0s)]
*  why people want to do that harm. And this morning that suspect is facing arson and charges with. He [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=609.52s)]
*  has yet to enter a plea, but we know he's due back in court next week. All right, Morgan Norwood, thank you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-y0JmOIZRc&t=616.3199999999999s)]
