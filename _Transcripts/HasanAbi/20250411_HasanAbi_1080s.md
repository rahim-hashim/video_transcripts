*  The court says steps must be taken to return him to the u.s [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=113.84s)]
*  Something the white house argues they don't have the jurisdiction to do scott mcfarland has the story scott. Good morning [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=117.36s)]
*  And dana good morning. It was a unanimous decision that kilmar abrigo garcia must be returned [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=124.88s)]
*  The supreme court didn't set a deadline [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=130.48s)]
*  But they ruled the trump administration must facilitate getting him out of that salvador in prison and back to the u.s [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=132.8s)]
*  Oh, the insurrection act is the fucking uh, april 20th [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=138.88s)]
*  meme [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=143.44s)]
*  That's circulating online that donald trump is going to invoke the insurrection act of 1807 [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=144.88s)]
*  on 4 2020 24 [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=151.67999999999998s)]

*  Followed by him declaring martial law. That's what you guys are saying, right? That's like [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=156.64s)]
*  I think that's like the liberal q anon, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, I mean he's insane but seems a bit far-fetched [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  I heard that from someone who trusted tiktok psychics for election advice [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  It's been nearly a month since kilmar abrigo garcia was plucked from a street in maryland by federal agents detained arrested and flown with more [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=174.18s)]
*  Than 200 others to el salvador [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=181.94s)]
*  After pleas from his wife that he has no you never know, okay [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  I have it on good authority from the tiktoks that I watched that donald trump is actually gonna [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=188.5s)]
*  Nuke ohio. He's crazy. He could do it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=193.46s)]
*  I get it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=197.22s)]
*  Do you understand why we can't operate? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  Uh with that kind of thinking like we can't just simply say like well, he's crazy. He could do it like I get it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=201.7s)]
*  He is crazy. But as far as I understand it's just like the the actual martial law rumor [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=208.26s)]
*  Came from facebook [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=215.62s)]
*  Or no, uh text originated from a march 21st article archive reported to be on the publishing platform medium.com [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=218.02s)]
*  Like let's look at this. This is uh snopes being distributed on yahoo news investigating rumor [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=223.88s)]
*  Trump will declare martial law on april 20th after invoking insurrection act of 1807 [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=229.56s)]
*  You know, I can't do any I can't do any commentary or criticism [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  If my assessment is uh, my assessment on donald trump revolves around well, he's crazy [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  You know what? I mean? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=247.48s)]
*  Like there's no analysis else to be made. He's crazy anything and everything is on the table. Nothing is off the table [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=248.6s)]
*  He's crazy online users should have rumor online users shared a rumor claiming u.s president donald trump would invoke insurrection act of 1807 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=254.6s)]
*  On april 20th 2025 followed by him declaring martial law the insurrection act grants u.s president the power to deploy the military into states [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=263.88s)]
*  for civilian law enforcement to share [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=272.28s)]
*  The rumor users copied and pasted the text from the first archived in a series of articles written by medium.com blogger only identified by the handle [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=275.08s)]
*  alethiis dennis [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=282.18s)]
*  The rumor partly pertained to a trump executive order issued on january 20th declaring a national emergency at the southern u.s border [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=285.0s)]
*  Part of that order requested trump to receive a joint report from the secretary's defense and homeland security within 90 days or by april 20th [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=291.0s)]
*  Advising whether to invoke the insurrection act of 1807 the order did not explicitly mention the words martial law [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=297.32s)]
*  While alethiis tenis the author of a series of articles featured at length [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=303.8s)]
*  On a wealth of data about trump's past actions as well as the information about the insurrection act this rumor existed [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  More as a prediction than a provable claim the dod department of homeland security in the white house did not yet respond to email requests for comment [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  A rumor that circulated online [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay, where it is said that one reader email snubs i'm seeing many posts on facebook [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=323.96s)]
*  That on april 20th trump will declare martial law another person referenced an executive order issued on january 20th the first day of the trump second term [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=328.44s)]
*  Okay, um, yeah, this is it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=335.32s)]
*  I really wish there was a way to get this to the hands of every american before april 20th from the medium [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=338.28s)]
*  Snopes is a fact checker. They aren't saying it's real. I know snopes is a fact checker. Let's see what their fact check comes out to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=343.96s)]
*  Okay, they didn't even fact check this. Uh-oh even snopes found a fact [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=352.2s)]
*  It can't check like I think his [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=356.44s)]
*  invoking of martial law or not martial law [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  but the insurrection act of 1807 is potentially to claim as a matter of national emergency and therefore [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=362.04s)]
*  Logistically in order to implement deportations. They have to utilize the military. There's not enough agents in ice [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  I I suspect that the reason why they're doing this is so that they can use the military for [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  Uh either invading mexico but operate on or operate on us soil to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  uh [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=387.08s)]
*  Deport people which is still insane [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  I just don't think that they're following false flag [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  Operations of otherwise peaceful protests arrest of journalists and politicians military takeovers of major u.s [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=395.38s)]
*  cities press censorship closed borders and postponed elections the author ended the article if we don't act before april 20th [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=399.48s)]
*  Then by april 23rd, it will already be too late if this happens libs will be eating you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=405.48s)]
*  I mean i'll be in prison. So I don't give a fuck if liberals will say I told you so [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  Because i'll be in fucking prison at that point, you know [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=416.76000000000005s)]
*  Oh, man, I can't believe liberals will be annoying to me in prison [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  After the american military comes to my house and arrests me for being a fucking political dissident [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, i'm hearing from my source that there's wmds into you on it. Yeah, can I say hi to you if we're in the same camp? No [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=431.48s)]
*  Yes, medium is just a blog [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=443.64000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, um, yeah, he's authorizing military to occupy and take jurisdiction over public land along the southern border. That's crazy stuff [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=445.8s)]
*  All right, let's get back to this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=453.32000000000005s)]
*  Supreme court says trump administration must facilitate return of man mistakenly deport no gang ties [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=455.0s)]
*  kilmar [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=460.76s)]
*  If you can hear me [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=463.08s)]
*  I'm still fighting for you [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  And then admission from the department of justice that abrago garcia was deported by mistake [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=469.08s)]
*  The error that you are referring to was a clerical error [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=474.35999999999996s)]
*  It was an administrative error the u.s supreme court has intervened upholding a lower court order that he'd be sent back to the u.s [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=477.23999999999995s)]
*  Thursday night the original judge handling the case judge paula zinnis of maryland ordered the trump administration to facilitate [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  The return of abrigo garcia to the u.s as soon as possible [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=492.28s)]
*  The order gives the department of justice until 9 30 am friday to detail abrigo garcia's location and the steps the u.s [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=496.52s)]
*  Is taken to bring him back the development comes amid scathing criticism of the trump administration [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=503.79999999999995s)]
*  For deporting 200 plus foreign nationals without any due process [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=509.79999999999995s)]
*  The trump administration looks like a more and more of a police state every day and that's a country that none of us recognize [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=514.28s)]
*  Also developing overnight the administration has moved to essentially cancel social security numbers for thousands of immigrants here on temporary legal status [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=521.88s)]
*  The white house said is a motivation to get them to self-deport [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=530.52s)]
*  But that is a form of financial death adriana makes it almost impossible to do business with financial institutions [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=534.2s)]
*  All right scott. Thank you for decades president trump is finally doing it caroline real quick the president of al-salvador is coming to the white house on monday [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=541.26s)]

*  The supreme court made their ruling last night very clear that it's the administration's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=552.6999999999999s)]
*  Responsibility to facilitate the return not to effectuate the return. I believe that yep [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=558.28s)]
*  classic [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=564.68s)]
*  Oh, they're doing it [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=566.2199999999999s)]

*  You can't tell us what the timeline looks like a lower court might but then we'll kick the cam back up [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=587.9s)]
*  To a higher court before we do that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=594.62s)]
*  Department of justice just filed another brief in the lower court [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=597.18s)]
*  I would defer you to that for any updates [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=600.38s)]

*  It was a mistake to send this man who is a lawful resident of the united states married to a u.s [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=623.18s)]

*  And what a court called kafka-esque mistake an attorney for abrigo garcia appeared in court this afternoon [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=643.5799999999999s)]
*  Here's what abrigo garcia's lawyer said outside court while calling on the white house to abide by the supreme court's order to return his client [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=649.34s)]
*  The government attorney did say that they intend to comply with the order and bring him back [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=657.1s)]
*  That's the bare minimum. They should have done that already. They've had plenty of time between [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=662.5400000000001s)]
*  The supreme court's order early yesterday evening and now he should be here in the united states. It's a five-hour flight [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=667.2600000000001s)]
*  Yes [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=673.26s)]
*  But he's not let's bring in our chief justice correspondent pierre thomas in greenbelt, maryland. So pierre you were there [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=674.86s)]
*  Tell us what happened in court and and what the judge's reaction to the government's position was [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=681.82s)]
*  Completely unhinged shit happening at the at every facet of government right now [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=688.04s)]
*  But especially when it comes to this stuff [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=694.54s)]
*  Terry I think the most notable thing about the hearing today was how frustrated the judge actually was [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=696.54s)]
*  She has some basic questions for the government's attorney. Number one was where is mr [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=703.02s)]
*  abrigo garcia and what is his condition and she was clearly flustered when the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=708.3s)]
*  Attorney for the government could not answer that question terry. He could not answer the question [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=715.82s)]
*  She asked him another question about exactly what steps were being taken [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=720.62s)]
*  All these days after her initial order to bring abrigo garcia back to the united states [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=724.94s)]
*  The government's attorney did not have an answer for that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=731.1s)]
*  That is why the judge ended up in the position of taking the stand that every day until they get mr [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=734.22s)]
*  Abrigo garcia back to this country. She wants an update to answer the questions that she put before the government [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=740.86s)]
*  She clearly has a sense that the government is not complying [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=747.5s)]
*  Intentionally and she's pushing them to give her the answers that she wants harry [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=751.98s)]
*  Yeah to pretty basic questions. Where is he? What's his condition under whose authority is? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=756.14s)]
*  Because pierre obviously the supreme court said [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=761.02s)]
*  That order is good law the supreme court all nine justices upheld her order saying that this man must be returned to the united states, but [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=763.74s)]
*  uh, the the court can't tell the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=772.14s)]
*  Government how to do it. Do you get the sense that the department of justice is not openly defying this order? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=775.1s)]
*  But is at least going to slow walk it and maybe not even do that much to accomplish it and obey it [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=781.74s)]
*  Well the question of whether they're slow walking it is an open one [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=789.26s)]
*  Uh, the government's attorney today drew in sign, uh simply was saying that the government was trying to evaluate the supreme court's ruling [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=793.34s)]
*  It took issue with part of the judge's interpretation of the supreme court ruling [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=800.54s)]
*  The government attorney did say that they intended to comply with the supreme court order [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=805.74s)]
*  But you raised a very critical question terry how quickly? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=811.9s)]
*  Uh will that take place and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=816.38s)]
*  Again, I can't tell you I can't emphasize enough the the level of frustration [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=818.86s)]
*  We saw from the judge when she asked that basic question. Where is mr [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=823.98s)]
*  Arbrego, guercia and under what condition is he being held? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=828.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a federal judge a lot of power there and she's having trouble exercising it over the trump administration pierre thomas. Thanks very much [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boTrEfXS_o&t=832.3s)]
