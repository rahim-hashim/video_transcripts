*  Oh, this is going to be a stern stern Lee worded letter. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=65.7s)]
*  Okay, you feel me the sternest. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=70.2s)]
*  Xi Jinping reportedly told State News Agency Shinwa that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=73.5s)]
*  China opposes acts that infringes on the territorial [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=77.1s)]
*  integrity of other countries and added that all parties [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=80.4s)]
*  should promote de-escalation was also putting forward his [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=84.1s)]
*  willingness to play a constructive role in this a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=87.5s)]
*  spokesperson me more here at the Foreign Ministry in Beijing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=91.1s)]
*  also made a thinly veiled critique to the United States [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=94.3s)]
*  saying I quote the country with special influence on Israel [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=98.6s)]
*  in particular needs to maintain sorry John is in bloodthirsty [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=102.1s)]
*  demons like the u.s. is brother. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=105.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  China needs to defend Iran. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=113.0s)]
*  They need to defend Iran for their own interests. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  They need to defend Iran for their own sovereignty. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=116.7s)]
*  Why is America attacking Iran? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  They're attacking Iran not for just like not because like [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  they were like, oh, we just don't like how many they're [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  attacking Iran because ultimately they want to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=131.4s)]
*  destabilize Iran, which is a major regional player so they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=134.1s)]
*  can have the entire energy production capacity of the world [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=138.4s)]
*  under their control with some exceptions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=143.2s)]
*  But pretty much the entirety of the energy production will [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  be will be free of Iranian intervention. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=151.9s)]
*  I'm not even making an argument that like China needs to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  enter the conflict for moral reasons like oh, yeah, like my [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  expectation is not that the Chinese state is going to do [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=164.6s)]
*  anything moral. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay, they're not they are only interested in China and that's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  it. China is nowhere near not even a fraction as ideologically [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  invested as like the USSR was in terms of offering support to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=180.7s)]
*  Allies. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=187.2s)]
*  Okay, they're not Iranian oils like 2% of China's energy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=189.2s)]
*  No, you're you're missing the forest for the fucking trees [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  and it's not 2% about 10%. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=196.0s)]
*  It's a lot more important to Iran than it is to China, but [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=199.6s)]
*  10% is nothing to it's nothing to discount. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=203.6s)]
*  But also but also you're you're failing to comprehend what I'm [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=208.2s)]
*  talking about when I say this is a matter of significant [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=212.4s)]
*  national security concern and sovereignty concern for China. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=216.7s)]
*  Okay, because if there is no Iranian threat in the region [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  and let's say America turns around and says we got to shut [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  off the oil faucet to China. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  There is no retaliatory measure. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=233.0s)]
*  There's no immediate retaliatory measure that that China can [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=236.1s)]
*  implement by way of its allies like Iran. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=239.0s)]
*  That's the whole reason why America wants to pack up Iran [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=241.5s)]
*  to begin with so they can have not one but two different [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=244.3s)]
*  methods of trying to to cripple Chinese manufacturing and to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=249.3s)]
*  to cripple China in general. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  I've spent the last week explaining this over and over [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=256.1s)]
*  again. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=258.8s)]
*  Law at all the chatters expecting China to do anything [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=260.3s)]
*  other than protect his own government interests remind that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=262.1s)]
*  both US and China sold weapons to Sri Lanka to help them with [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  their time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=266.0s)]
*  Those which are war crimes almost identical in characters [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=266.8s)]
*  of those Israel's doing as the Palestinians morals never [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=268.8s)]
*  stopped China from taking the same side as the US on the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=271.1s)]
*  time. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=273.0s)]
*  This is pure geopolitics. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=273.7s)]
*  I know which is why I'm saying from a pure geopolitics [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=274.6s)]
*  perspective. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=277.5s)]
*  I think China needs to react beyond just simply stern warnings, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=278.0s)]
*  but what a fuck. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=282.2s)]
*  What do I know, you know? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=283.2s)]
*  I'm a nobody. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=285.5s)]
*  I'm just a dumb guy Xi Jinping. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=286.8s)]
*  I'm sure is is making a calculated decision here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=289.0s)]
*  See what I'm saying in a fair and objective position state [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=293.6s)]
*  media such as the tabloid the Global Times also blaming the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=298.1s)]
*  US for abandoning the nuclear deal and letting this situation [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=302.0s)]
*  escalate China's official stance is that Israel's actions [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=306.8s)]
*  constitute a violation of Iran's territorial integrity. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=310.9s)]
*  And although the Chinese Foreign Minister did tell his [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=315.0s)]
*  Israeli counterpart that Israel shouldn't have to constantly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=317.9s)]
*  live in anxiety about a potential war either. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=320.8s)]
*  This is by the way a much stronger tone and position that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=324.6s)]
*  China has taken compared to when Russia invaded Ukraine in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  any case. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  So this conflict is creating the kind of instability Chinese [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=333.5s)]
*  leaders want to avoid at all cost. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=337.5s)]
*  So you want China to join the war? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=340.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  I want China to defend its own own interest in the region. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=342.5s)]
*  Why is America defending Israel? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=347.1s)]
*  Why is America letting Israel do whatever the fuck it wants in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=348.7s)]
*  the region? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=350.7s)]
*  It's for its own patient from the adversary that America is [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=351.8s)]
*  very clearly gearing to fight. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=356.2s)]
*  China has made a lot of of Hassan being a warhawk. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=359.2s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  Iran is the one that's been attacked. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=366.2s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm a warhawk. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=368.8s)]
*  Are you stupid? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=370.0s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=371.0s)]
*  I'm saying China has a defend Iran. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=372.3s)]
*  Okay, Chinese presence is a deterrence enough as it is a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  massive trade partner of a bunch of the other Gulf region [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  countries as far as oil goes and also with Israel as well. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=385.1s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  It needs to I'm a peace Hawk not a warhawk. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  Its presence is a deterrence. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  What the is just like Iranian retaliatory strikes are the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=397.1s)]
*  only way that Israel ever stands down judging by 77 years [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  of Israeli history of conquest and blood and soil politics. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  The only time Israel ever stands down is when the the death [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=411.1s)]
*  toll for the Israeli occupying force is too high. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=414.8s)]
*  Stand down when there is a a militant deterrence in the form [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=421.6s)]
*  of retaliations. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=427.8s)]
*  I don't want anybody to lob missiles at anybody. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=429.70000000000005s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  But Israel doesn't stop. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=435.1s)]

*  It's like saying, hey, if you tell Israel to stand down by [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  engaging in discourse here in America and in acts of civil [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=530.4s)]

*  The best option is the most peaceful one. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=538.3s)]
*  Okay, but you have to go down these different routes and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=541.9s)]
*  exhaust all of the avenues. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  The best possible way to stop Israel is by getting America to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  tell Israel to stand down and the only way to do that is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=553.0s)]
*  why with tremendous public pressure, okay, tremendous [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=555.8s)]
*  public pressure that causes a lot of private enterprise from [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=559.6s)]
*  also enacting economic pressure on the state of Israel. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=565.1s)]
*  But if that doesn't happen, then the next step is let's [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=567.9s)]
*  say in a world where America says you have to stand down [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=571.0s)]
*  and Israel doesn't comply which would never happen obviously, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=573.0s)]
*  but in that circumstance then America shuts off all aid and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=575.8s)]
*  all support and implement sanctions on Israel. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=579.3s)]
*  Let's say Israel says I'm not going to stop. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=581.7s)]
*  I'm not going to stand down after all sanctions. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=583.7s)]
*  The you know, nuclear sanctions package is implemented on [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=585.9s)]
*  Israel like it was with Russia, which by the way, Russia [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=589.5s)]
*  obviously has a much larger economy that is geared towards [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=592.2s)]
*  avoiding these sorts of sanctions and that's precisely [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=598.3000000000001s)]
*  the reason why they were able to backtracking an incoming ban. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  Oh, you're talking about the chatter. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=605.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  No, it's fine. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=607.1s)]
*  There can be some reasonable discourse here. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=607.8000000000001s)]
*  Calm down. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=609.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=610.2s)]
*  If that doesn't work, if the sanctions package doesn't work, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=611.0s)]
*  then I have to engage in military intervention. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  Does that mean I'm a war hawk? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=616.2s)]
*  I don't want that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=617.7s)]
*  Obviously none of these things would happen because it [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  takes one phone call for Israel to stand down from America [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=620.9s)]
*  obviously due to all of the other options that America has. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=624.0s)]
*  Israel would cease to exist if it wasn't for America. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=627.1s)]
*  Israel would never be able to be this violent of a country [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=632.4s)]
*  if it wasn't for a constant flow of American weapons and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=635.0s)]
*  American defense contracts and American munitions that they [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=638.6s)]
*  can use in their offensive campaigns and the anti-air [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  defense systems that America is constantly supplying munitions [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=645.6s)]
*  for. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=651.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=651.5s)]
*  The same principle applies for Iran. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=652.2s)]
*  Iran is currently engaging in very restrained acts of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=655.1s)]
*  retaliation as opposed to Israel's incredibly unrestrained [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=659.5s)]
*  acts of escalation. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=664.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=666.4s)]
*  It's tit for tat. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=667.0s)]
*  But that is not seemingly enough for Israel to stop. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=668.3000000000001s)]
*  Obviously the first option and the best option here is a [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=673.1s)]
*  reasonable compromise through the negotiations process. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=676.9000000000001s)]
*  America's positions, however, are maximalist and they seem [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=681.5s)]
*  they seem disinterested in even budging a little bit. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  Like ridiculous provisions like oh, you can have a nuclear [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  energy grid as long as you're getting nuclear power outside [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=695.0s)]
*  Like that's ridiculous. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=695.5s)]
*  It's a non-starter. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=696.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay, they don't even want Iran to have any nuclear power [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=697.5s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=701.8s)]
*  That is a ridiculous position. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=703.0s)]
*  Not that it matters because very clearly America used the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=704.9s)]
*  the the nuclear bargaining the negotiations as a as a cloak [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=709.3s)]
*  and daggers operation to allow Israel to first strike Iran. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=714.0999999999999s)]
*  But if the retaliatory attacks don't actually cause Israel to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=718.1999999999999s)]
*  incur significant enough penalties that they stand down [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=722.0999999999999s)]
*  then there has to be something else that is a protective banner [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=725.6s)]
*  over Iran and that is the presence of China. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=729.0s)]
*  If that doesn't work, if America and Israel are so gung-ho [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=732.1999999999999s)]
*  that they still want to destabilize the country, they still [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=736.6s)]
*  want to do decapitation strike and and and you know continue [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=741.1s)]

*  effort to defend its asset in the region. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=751.6s)]

*  at all. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=786.0s)]

*  American ambition in the region as a destabilizing force when [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=788.5s)]

*  this channel is that Iran is very close to being able to [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1165.6s)]

*  What do you make of that argument? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1181.7s)]

*  They probably have a division of work. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1453.3s)]
*  The United States was not very much involved on the surface of [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1455.1999999999998s)]
*  the situation, but no one should be surprised if the United [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1458.5s)]

*  United States is involved from the very beginning of the war, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1472.0s)]

*  United States still keep saying that they are not involved, but [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1484.4s)]

*  My personal concern is that if the United States really gets [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1522.6000000000001s)]
*  bogged down in this war against Iran, no one knows what will [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1526.1s)]

*  peace and stability anywhere in the world and China will feel [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1559.8s)]

*  wrong. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1583.1000000000001s)]
*  If there isn't peace then they can't do trade. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1583.9s)]
*  It would be devastating for trade maxers. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1586.5s)]
*  They need to trade max for China's own benefit. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1589.5s)]

*  I want to pick up on that because we heard from President Trump [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1620.6000000000001s)]

*  did kill the Supreme Leader? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1640.0s)]
*  This is exactly the confusion that President Trump is creating [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1643.3s)]
*  deliberately or unintentionally. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1647.6s)]
*  I don't think assassination of a head of state or head of government [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1650.0s)]
*  or political leaders or military leaders of another country is [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1654.3s)]
*  the right thing to do in the world of today. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1657.7s)]
*  I think countries need to have the minimum decency and the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1660.7s)]
*  protocol in dealing with another country. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1664.8s)]
*  Assassination is the bad thing and assassination may serve as [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1667.2s)]

*  haunt you. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1676.2s)]
*  Therefore, engaging in assassination, especially against [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1676.8s)]
*  head of state or leader of another religious faith, for example, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1681.3s)]

*  sovereign country is the wrong thing to do, especially at a [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1691.1s)]

*  surprise attack against Iran. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1700.6999999999998s)]
*  This is the worst time for the head of the state of the United [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1703.3999999999999s)]

*  killing the leader of Iran. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1712.0s)]
*  You mentioned in your first answer, where you painted a [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1715.3s)]

*  between Beijing and Tehran. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1723.0s)]
*  Let me put the scenario to you. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1724.6s)]
*  If Iran goes the same way as, for example, Syria and the [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1726.8s)]
*  assassination that you mentioned or otherwise brings about a [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1731.5s)]
*  change of management, shall we say, in Iran, I mean, that [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1736.3999999999999s)]
*  would be a loss for China, wouldn't it? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1740.3999999999999s)]
*  Because you'd have lost an ally, a key ally in this region, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1741.8s)]
*  because if a pro-western government replaces the government [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1746.2s)]
*  that's there already, that would be a loss for China, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1749.3999999999999s)]
*  wouldn't it? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1752.2s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1754.0s)]
*  I think China has always the long perspective and historical [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1755.1s)]
*  perspective to look at any contemporary events like... [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1759.8999999999999s)]

*  then you already know that every Chinese person, even if [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1773.4s)]

*  That's what the chatter said. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1810.0s)]

*  There are actual libs there. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1812.4s)]
*  Gao is very much pro-CCP, have met him in person. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1813.5s)]
*  He's an extension of the state. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1815.9s)]
*  His role in his think tank is like a diplomat. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1817.5s)]
*  Billy D Thumbo? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1819.9s)]
*  What had happened in Syria and what is happening in Iran? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1821.5s)]
*  What do you put me on for? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1826.4s)]
*  We are not confused by the events on a day-to-day basis. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1828.9s)]
*  We look at the situation in 10 years, in 100 years, sometimes [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1833.8000000000002s)]
*  500 years, if not even longer. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1838.8000000000002s)]
*  Therefore, in the historical perspective, if you really look [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1841.2s)]
*  at the situation in the long haul perspective, war is bad. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1845.0s)]
*  For Israel to impose an undeclared war on Iran is an aggression. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1850.3000000000002s)]
*  And whatever Iran is doing is justified because they are defending [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1857.1000000000001s)]
*  their own sovereignty and territorial integrity. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1862.6000000000001s)]
*  They are fighting back against aggressors. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1865.4s)]
*  And if the United States wants to join Israel to become an aggressor [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1868.5s)]
*  against the Iran, well, history will eventually have its own verdict. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1872.2s)]
*  Therefore, I think all of us need to work on with Israel to [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1877.5s)]
*  stop the war as quickly as possible and come up with peaceful [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1881.9s)]
*  ways to negotiate with Iran. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1885.9s)]
*  And I personally will completely support the ending of whatever [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1889.2s)]
*  nuclear weapon program, if any, by Iran. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1893.3000000000002s)]

*  Middle East will become a nuclear free zone that will be in the [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1901.3000000000002s)]

*  over again, it's America slowly but surely erodes all of China's allies. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1914.3s)]
*  China will do its best to promote the real justified result for any [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1921.4s)]
*  such tension or conflict of war and China will do its best to prevent [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1927.9s)]

*  Were the United States to intervene and join forces with Israel in [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1990.6999999999998s)]

*  Do you see a day that China or Russia or other actors could perhaps [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=1999.0s)]
*  join in support of Iran? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2003.8s)]
*  Well, imposing a war on a great country like Iran with 1.66 million [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2007.4s)]
*  square kilometers and with up to more than 90 million people and a [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2014.7s)]

*  Shia people throughout the world is really poking for more disaster [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2026.3s)]
*  if it is not stopped right away. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2032.6s)]
*  And if other countries want to join the fight on the side of Israel, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2034.8999999999999s)]
*  I will urge them to stop that right away. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2039.8999999999999s)]
*  And if for example, oh yeah, totally. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2043.0s)]
*  Oh, thank you for the urging. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2045.7s)]
*  It seems like they're definitely stopping England, Germany, France [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2047.6s)]
*  for other countries want to join the fight against Iran. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2052.6s)]
*  You never want to exclude the possibility that other major countries [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2056.0s)]
*  want to fight together with Iran because the war imposed on Iran is [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2060.0s)]
*  the unjustified war. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2065.5s)]
*  It's a war of aggression. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2067.0s)]
*  It's undeclared war. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2068.6000000000004s)]
*  It's a surprise attack and any people, any country, any country under [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2069.7000000000003s)]
*  such surprise attack and attack of aggression has full legal justification [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2074.4s)]
*  to fight back. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2080.4s)]
*  Therefore stopping the war right now is the best way. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2081.9s)]
*  Allow me to escalate and to get out of control will most likely hurt [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2085.2999999999997s)]

*  and in many other countries in that particular part of the world. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2095.4s)]
*  And I think China is doing the right thing urging on Israel to stop [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2099.6s)]
*  the war urging on Iran not to escalate for example, try to wrap up [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2103.2s)]
*  the situation so that all parties involved can talk about peace rather [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2108.4s)]

*  worried that a US bomb wouldn't be able to strike deep enough [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2421.0s)]

*  today you had Trump posted on Truth Social. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2425.6s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has no idea what my thoughts are [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2427.6s)]

*  So we're gonna have to wait to see what happens as we go into [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2431.2s)]
*  the weekend, but I'm not gonna leave you high and dry. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2433.2s)]
*  I'm gonna be covering the updates on my main TikTok. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2435.4s)]
*  It's Philip DeFranco. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2437.5s)]
*  I'll link it in the description. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2438.4s)]
*  Did they miss their target when they struck the empty wing? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2440.0s)]
*  It was an empty wing the target. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2442.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2445.2s)]
*  My suspicion is that they used like a cluster style ballistic [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2446.5s)]
*  missile, which is not as not as precise. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2451.7999999999997s)]
*  And in the process while they were trying to target like that [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2457.1s)]
*  area, I assume there is like is there's military shit [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2459.9s)]
*  everywhere in Israel, right? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2464.2000000000003s)]
*  You have anti-air defense systems everywhere. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2465.4s)]
*  So you have launchers everywhere. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2470.0s)]
*  Those are military targets. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2471.4s)]
*  You have, you know, espionage facilities military bases. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2472.7000000000003s)]
*  Ironically enough, that's literally what Israel says Hamas [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2476.8s)]
*  is doing. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2481.2000000000003s)]
*  But I suspect that given the given the the lack of precision [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2482.7000000000003s)]
*  from this type of cluster type munition, I assume they were [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2491.2000000000003s)]
*  I assume they were bombing military positions that ended up [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2495.6000000000004s)]
*  also hitting the hospital or they could have directly targeted [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2498.9s)]
*  the hospital to to be fair because so far if you noticed [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2502.2000000000003s)]
*  every single every single retaliatory attack that Iran [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2507.7000000000003s)]
*  is engaged in has actually been following through on on [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2511.1s)]
*  Israel's acts of aggression first Israel has already struck [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2517.1s)]
*  an Iranian hospital as I covered before a couple days prior. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2520.7s)]
*  The best example I can give you is the the the oil refinery [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2524.7s)]
*  that they struck the Iran struck after Israel had hit the [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2531.7999999999997s)]
*  the oil Depot in Tehran so I could totally see them actually [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2538.3s)]
*  hitting a hospital deliberately as well. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2543.4s)]
*  I mean, it's a war crime and they have hit civilian infrastructure [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2545.3s)]
*  already considering that Israel already hit their nuclear facilities [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2548.9s)]
*  a couple times at this point and especially the last last [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2555.3s)]
*  night's strikes on a nuclear facility the one called a rock [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2560.0s)]
*  that's a collaborative nuclear facility with China and Iran. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2565.6s)]
*  I suspect that today will be tonight when they strike back [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2570.2000000000003s)]
*  depending on what took place today because there was some [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2577.3s)]
*  reports of maybe like a decapitation strike that took place [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2580.0s)]
*  against how many but I suspect that at some point they will [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2583.6s)]
*  strike back at a Israeli nuclear facility. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2588.3s)]
*  It's all been tit-for-tat. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2592.4s)]
*  It's all been tit-for-tat so far out of their mind or completely [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfrnqVc-8Q&t=2594.2000000000003s)]
