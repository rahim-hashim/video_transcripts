# Israeli PM Sabotaged The Hostage Deal | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA)
*  They were prosecuted by Israeli courts. People that were directly aligned with Benjamin and Yahoo that worked under Benjamin and Yahoo were leaking classified information to European outlets in an effort to sully the deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, there was this part as well. You have Golan admitting Hannibal directive, which everyone said was bullshit. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=18.0s)]
*  Was the order given to use the Hannibal directive, which is the Israeli directive to kill Israeli citizens if they're taking hostage rather than allow Palestinians to use them as a bargaining chip. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=25.62s)]
*  I think tactically in some places it was says you have Golan in other places it was not and that is a problem. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, something I've talked about for quite some quite some time. But yeah, a US Senator wants Americans who use deep seek to be thrown in prison. That's cool. Yeah, there is more from this interview though. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=48.62s)]
*  Golan, you have Golan former Defense Minister you have Golan. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=64.62s)]
*  Current Golan confirms what we've long known same ceasefire deal was there and agreed by Hamas back in April and Israel torpedoed it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=70.62s)]
*  Let's talk about the hostages. Did the Israeli government do everything possible to bring them back? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=79.62s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=84.62s)]
*  We could have brought back more hostages earlier at a lower cost. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=86.62s)]
*  The agreement we see unfolding these days is broadly speaking, according to the Americans, according to the cabinet secretary, essentially the same deal that was on the table in May, which you supported. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=90.62s)]
*  Oh, don't worry. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=108.62s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=109.62s)]
*  Was identical to the current proposal, except it was worse in several ways. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=115.62s)]
*  Unfortunately, there are fewer hostages still alive now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=121.62s)]
*  The more time has passed and we are paying a heavier price. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=126.62s)]
*  At least 110 additional convicted murders will be released in this process. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=129.62s)]
*  I like that he's saying the deal is identical, except it's worse because they're releasing more Palestinians as a process as a part of this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=137.62s)]
*  This clip would hit hard if any of your critics cared even a little bit about the truth. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=146.62s)]
*  No, my critics do not care about the truth. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=149.62s)]
*  That's why they're my critics, especially on this issue. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=151.62s)]
*  You can have ideological disagreements with me. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=154.62s)]
*  You can have disagreements, but on, I don't know my best standards and practices, but you can't disagree with the truth. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=156.62s)]
*  And because people refuse to contend with the reality, they usually try to push for alternative ways of being critical or desperately seek out with a fine-tuned comb with a fine-tuned comb. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=164.62s)]
*  Anything that they can clip out of context. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=177.62s)]
*  And the damage to the Israeli ethos is severe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=179.62s)]
*  So who's responsible for the fact that it didn't happen back then? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=182.62s)]
*  Take, for example, the events of April. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=186.62s)]
*  It explains the entire situation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=188.62s)]
*  The War Cabinet unanimously decided to proceed with a deal. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=190.62s)]
*  And that included withdrawing from the NetSignal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=193.62s)]
*  With different mechanisms for releasing hostages. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=198.62s)]
*  By the way, I literally mentioned this as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=200.62s)]
*  Not only did I mention this as well, but also on top of that, Israeli hostage families also directly mentioned this saying that the responsibility was entirely on Benjamin Netanyahu's hands. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=203.62s)]
*  For refusing to withdraw from the Netzerim corridor in the Philadelphia corridor for no reason whatsoever. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=217.62s)]
*  It was like a last second edition. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=224.62s)]
*  In exchange for prisoners. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=228.62s)]
*  The decision was made in the early afternoon by the evening during a broader Cabinet meeting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=232.62s)]
*  During a broader Cabinet discussion. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=237.62s)]
*  Finance Minister Smoltz, who was not supposed to be privy to the plan, entered and said, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=240.62s)]
*  There's a plan to return 18 hostages in exchange for withdrawing from the Netzerim and so on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=249.62s)]
*  We will oppose this in the early afternoon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=256.62s)]
*  There's a plan to return 18 hostages in exchange for withdrawing from the Netzerim and so on. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=260.62s)]
*  We will oppose this and we will leave the government if it happens. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=266.62s)]
*  I wonder how Smoltz was privy to this information. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=268.62s)]
*  It's Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=272.62s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to tank the deal. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=274.62s)]
*  I mean, his people... [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=276.62s)]
*  Murat! [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=279.62s)]
*  Telephone to the office. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=281.62s)]
*  Come on, let's continue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=282.62s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu routinely sought out to sully the deal over and over and over again. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=283.62s)]
*  And he took the initiative. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=290.62s)]
*  I mean, he had people in his orbit leaking classified information to European outlets. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=292.62s)]
*  If you recall, they were prosecuted by Israeli courts. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=300.62s)]
*  They were prosecuted by Israeli courts. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=304.62s)]
*  People that were directly aligned with Benjamin Netanyahu, that worked under Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=305.62s)]
*  were leaking classified information to European outlets in an effort to sully the deal. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=311.62s)]
*  Who told him? I don't know. I didn't tell him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=316.62s)]
*  We had told the security establishment we needed to secure 33 hostages with a minimum of 18. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=321.62s)]
*  Yet the number leaked to the media shortly after. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=326.62s)]
*  Within an hour, two or three, it was 18. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=331.62s)]
*  It took one, two, three days before Hamas understood the situation from Israeli media and said, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=334.62s)]
*  And that deal collapsed, only resurfacing at the end of May through the president's speech. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=338.62s)]
*  That's not the reason why that deal collapsed. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=343.62s)]
*  The reason, I don't know, sounds like a really good guy in a moderating voice. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=345.62s)]
*  Okay, I'm not even going to entertain these jokes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=348.62s)]
*  Okay, calm down. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=351.62s)]
*  Did someone leak this from the cabinet to small Jewish to sabotage the deal? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=353.62s)]
*  No, the real reason why the deal fell apart is the Netzerim corridor was destroyed. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=357.62s)]
*  That's the real reason. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=362.62s)]
*  And no, Yoav Golan is not a moderating voice, nor a good guy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=364.62s)]
*  He is a j**s-idle, monstrous piece of s**t who very actively and deliberately in the initial stages after October 7 said that we are fighting human animals and we must cut out their electricity, their food and their water. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=367.62s)]
*  And then he proceeded to do that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=376.62s)]
*  And he said, I don't know, I don't know. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=379.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=382.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=384.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=386.62s)]
*  Okay, so no, he is not a good guy as evidenced by even this information because despite the fact that he has a personal bone to pick with Benjamin Netanyahu, he is once again still entertaining certain aspects of the war cabinet's mismanagement by claiming that it was actually Hamasa who drew from the deal because they found out that, you know, parts of the deal were leaked to Israeli media. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=388.62s)]
*  When the real reason why the deal never came to fruition was because Israel refused to concede because they added additional s**t. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=407.62s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu added additional clauses to the deal, such as not withdrawing from the Netzerim corridor. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=415.62s)]
*  Yo, every video game just went offline. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=422.62s)]
*  What is happening today in my chat? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=425.62s)]
*  YouTube went offline. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=428.62s)]
*  Yo, is every video game actually offline? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=430.62s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=433.62s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=434.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=436.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=438.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=440.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=442.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=444.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=446.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=448.62s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=450.62s)]
*  Sound detector says yes. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=452.62s)]
*  Oh, PSN? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=454.62s)]
*  Sam. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=455.62s)]
*  You understand more than I do, and it's a problem to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=456.12s)]
*  understand more than I do. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=457.98s)]
*  But to say, Netanyahu, if I were to stop at the point where [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=459.48s)]
*  you have a problem and you want me to stop, then it wouldn't [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=462.18s)]
*  have been a fight, it wouldn't have been a sign of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=464.38s)]
*  hate, it wouldn't have been a sign of help. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=466.06s)]
*  Wouldn't all of this happen? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=467.66s)]
*  First, to push, to take, to take and to continue the fight [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=470.14s)]
*  in the Hizan. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=474.3s)]
*  What, the fact that Azam was talking about that unironically [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=476.46s)]
*  as a conspiracy was incredible. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=479.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=480.62s)]
*  I love it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=482.74s)]
*  Here's Piers Morgan denying the Hannibal Directive. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=483.34s)]
*  Yeah, of course he's denying it, because he's a propagandist [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=486.06s)]
*  for Israel. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=488.46s)]
*  Many mainstream outlets are propagandists for Israel. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=490.29999999999995s)]
*  About the 1,200 people who they murdered and the 7,000 [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=492.78s)]
*  they wounded. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=495.7s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=496.5s)]
*  Hundreds of those people were killed when Israel implemented [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=497.9s)]
*  the Hannibal Directive. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=501.14s)]
*  That's simply not true. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=501.94s)]
*  It simply is true. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=502.85999999999996s)]
*  It isn't. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=504.34s)]
*  And I encourage you, in the spirit of journalistic inquiry [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=505.05999999999995s)]
*  and curiosity, to really look that up. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=508.9s)]
*  It's already been thoroughly investigated. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=511.66s)]
*  And also, this is four months ago too. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=514.4200000000001s)]
*  So at this point, we did know that Israel played a role [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=517.3000000000001s)]
*  in killing at least some of the Israelis that were [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=521.34s)]
*  about to be taken hostage. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=525.74s)]
*  It's not like this was immediately after October 7, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5gPuzNXZA&t=528.14s)]
