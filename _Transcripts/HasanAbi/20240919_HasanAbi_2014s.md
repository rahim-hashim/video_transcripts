# How Does A Fed Cut Affect the American Economy? | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ)
*  Okay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Bro, he did the Zelensky tagline. Yo, is him bro. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=3.36s)]
*  That's him. I swear to God, that's him, bro. That's him. Is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  him, bro. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=17.8s)]
*  This shit. Here's the Fed chair. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=25.16s)]
*  Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=27.64s)]
*  on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=30.8s)]
*  and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=34.28s)]
*  Our economy is strong overall and has made significant [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=36.92s)]
*  progress toward our goals over the past two years. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=39.6s)]
*  The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=43.2s)]
*  Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=46.6s)]
*  7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of August. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  We're committed to maintaining our economy's strength by [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=56.16s)]
*  2 percent goal. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=59.63999999999999s)]
*  decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=62.4s)]
*  our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. This [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=65.96s)]
*  decision reflects our growing confidence that we're going to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=69.28s)]
*  alleviate inflation for a lot of people. And so if you have any [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=79.12s)]
*  reactions that we love. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  They're like, yeah, we want the Fed to cut the interest rates. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=86.76s)]
*  If it cuts the interest rates, boo. Now we don't want it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=91.64s)]
*  My reaction is a half a point is nothing compared to what [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  American families have been dealing with for the last three [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=102.16s)]
*  years. The question is, really? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Iran or Biden or Busters? Iranian hackers sent stolen [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=106.0s)]
*  Trump campaign information to the Biden campaign. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=109.88s)]
*  I'm deeply frustrated that the branding camp didn't use the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  stolen hacked information. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=115.72s)]
*  I think that's because historically rate cuts have led to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  a recession. Yeah, dude, those people are definitely making [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=119.96s)]
*  that calculation. Also, a rate cut of of half a percent is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=123.6s)]
*  nothing. So which one is it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=128.72s)]
*  Are they mad that the rate cuts are not large enough or are they [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=130.48s)]
*  mad that like they perceive a recession to happen? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=133.96s)]
*  It just spells what it will look like for the future. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=137.8s)]
*  With an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=142.28s)]
*  in the labor market can be maintained in a context of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2%. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=149.2s)]
*  We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=153.52s)]
*  I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=156.76s)]
*  reviewing economic developments. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=159.8s)]
*  Terry, we now know that the Federal Reserve is cutting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=161.48s)]
*  interest rates by half of a percentage point, a 50 basis point rate cut. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=164.6s)]
*  That is bigger than it had originally expected on the bigger side of things. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=169.76s)]
*  When you think about this move from the Fed, this is an historic move, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=174.16s)]
*  the first rate cut in four years from the Federal Reserve. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=177.88s)]
*  And now it is sending a very clear signal that it is taking this fight [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=181.44s)]
*  seriously, that it wants to preserve the jobs market in its statement. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=185.24s)]
*  It makes that clear that it is making a half point rate cut to try to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=189.52s)]
*  preserve the jobs market with inflation now closer to its target. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=193.84s)]
*  So again, Terry, a lot of division going into this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=197.28s)]
*  The Fed went bigger and went with that half point rate cut. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=199.6s)]
*  Right. Got it. Thank you, Elizabeth. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=203.24s)]
*  They went bigger, Alexis. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=205.16s)]
*  And so first, why? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=207.08s)]
*  Why do they go bigger and what's it going to mean? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=209.32s)]
*  There were two camps of thought here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=211.08s)]
*  I mean, they got a lot of criticism, Terry, a few years ago when they started [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=212.6s)]
*  raising interest rates, many thought they were too late to react to what was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=216.68s)]
*  happening during the pandemic and that that's why inflation really got away [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=221.6s)]
*  from them. And we saw inflation hit a 40 year high. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=226.76s)]
*  So there were some who said, look, you need this aggressive half point cut now [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=229.16s)]
*  to help out the job market, which has been slowing down and to prevent the economy [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=233.56s)]
*  from maybe moving in the opposite direction, slowing down so much that we [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=237.88s)]
*  would possibly tip into a recession maybe later next year. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=241.84s)]
*  Others are saying a half point is that it could actually, believe it or not, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=246.32s)]
*  fan inflation again, because it might be a stimulant for the economy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=250.52s)]
*  There are some who thought a quarter point cut was the way to go. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=254.8s)]
*  If you look at the number here on the screen, a live number of the Dow Jones [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=257.68s)]
*  Industrial Average rallying now more than 260 points. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=260.6s)]
*  Clearly, Wall Street believes that the Fed did the right thing and that it was [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=263.92s)]
*  time for this half point aggressive interest rate cut. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=267.92s)]
*  All right. So, Elizabeth, this is this is Wall Street likes it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=271.32s)]
*  We were just looking at the stock market going up. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=276.2s)]
*  What does it mean for consumers, though? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  You know what this means, Terry, is that we are clearly on this trajectory. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  The Fed is very seriously now embarking on this path of lower interest rates. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=284.32s)]
*  I do want to point something out to you, Terry, from the statement from the Federal [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=289.0s)]
*  Reserve, which was just released, that there was one governor of the Fed that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  dissented. What that means is they didn't agree with this decision. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  They said instead they would have preferred that smaller rate cut. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  But otherwise, all of the members of the Federal Reserve did vote in favor of this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  And what that shows, there was a pretty big consensus around a half point cut. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  And that shows that the Federal Reserve, as it kind of met over the last two days, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=310.44s)]
*  as it looked at the economy, looked at the data that it has right now, it decided [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=314.36s)]
*  that this was the move that will ultimately result in what it wants to do, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=317.96s)]
*  which is preserving that jobs market like Alexis was talking about and also [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=321.52s)]
*  continuing to keep inflation in check. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=325.4s)]
*  So right now, what that means, you ask what it means for consumers, we will [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=327.4s)]
*  expect to see rates lower when you think about mortgage rates. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=330.64s)]
*  We've already seen them trending down. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=333.96s)]
*  Those should continue to go lower in the months ahead. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=335.28s)]
*  Credit card rates generally start to go lower auto loan rates, impacts on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=338.24s)]
*  businesses too, who are taking out loans. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=342.32s)]
*  And that's where you'll start to trickle, see this trickle throughout the American [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=343.92s)]
*  economy, Terry, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=346.68s)]
*  both Donald Trump and Kamala here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=347.44s)]
*  Doubtful. I will see. What are you talking about, dude? We'll see. I mean, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=349.24s)]
*  they've interest rates have been interest rates have been going down beyond this, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=353.76s)]
*  but I don't think that it'll ever get back to a point that I don't think that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=359.6s)]
*  it'll get ever get back to a point where, where it was a locked in my [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=363.8s)]
*  rate at 2020 at 3.7. I don't see it hitting that anymore. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=367.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't even think it'll go down there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=371.08s)]
*  I feel like the same principle stands for the same principle stands for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=373.76s)]
*  for inflation everywhere else, which is that when people get comfortable, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=379.44s)]
*  when people get comfortable at a certain at a at a certain interest rate, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  as in people still go out and refinance, I don't think that I don't think that I [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=388.84s)]
*  don't think that banks will go along with it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=395.4s)]
*  But who knows? Boeing is putting 10s of 1000 employees on furlough. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=396.88s)]
*  I know we're going to talk about Boeing. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=399.96s)]
*  Did you see this crazy inflation tick tock? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=401.52s)]
*  I just like look through my Walmart history and I found this like [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=403.76s)]
*  Walmart order from two years ago for the whole month worth of groceries. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=409.44s)]
*  Forty five items cost one hundred and twenty six dollars. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=413.84s)]
*  A whole month of groceries just for me, basically. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=418.24s)]
*  But I did notice this reorder all button, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=421.32s)]
*  and I wanted to see how much it would cost now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=425.16s)]
*  Now this order of 45 items for one month would have cost four hundred and fourteen dollars. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=428.36s)]
*  That is I've been telling people do not believe the government [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=437.68s)]
*  when they say inflation is only eight or 10 percent. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=441.96s)]
*  Food's gone up double, triple. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=444.32s)]
*  That's over 100 percent. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=446.64s)]
*  This whoever doing inflation numbers, liars. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=448.32s)]
*  What do you mean? It's not just groceries, man. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=451.68s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=454.8s)]
*  There's also a ton of junk fees that a lot of like online delivery services [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=456.08s)]
*  have added over the course of the past couple of years. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  One thing I will tell you, for example, if you ever order Uber Eats, OK, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=464.04s)]
*  and you happen to actually go to the restaurant that you normally order [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=469.04s)]
*  Uber Eats from, look at the prices inside the restaurant [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=472.44s)]
*  versus look at the prices for the same items on Uber Eats. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=475.24s)]
*  The prices on Uber Eats are much higher. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=478.36s)]
*  If you go to the restaurant directly is cheaper. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=481.32s)]
*  I'm talking about the same exact thing. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=484.0s)]
*  Like this is before the delivery fees. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=485.76s)]
*  This is before all the other additional fees tacked on to it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=487.56s)]
*  A lot of people don't even know that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=491.56s)]
*  And the same goes for Amazon as well. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  Bro, Uber Eats is a luxury. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=495.68s)]
*  Ain't no everyday man using that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=496.92s)]
*  The example that we're looking at is literally Amazon delivery dog. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=499.56s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=503.92s)]
*  Like, that's the reason why I'm using the Uber Eats example. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=505.36s)]
*  Even if you pick up through Uber Eats, it's still more expensive. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, yes, they do. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=512.52s)]
*  Or it was Walmart, sorry, not Amazon. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  But still, that's like online delivery, online grocery delivery. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=516.56s)]
*  So there's probably a bunch of additional junk fees associated [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=520.8s)]
*  with that purchase now beyond the fact that Amazon has also tacked up the prices. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=524.4s)]
*  Labor economist, she's chill on today's rate cut points. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=528.52s)]
*  What does this mean? Is it good? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=532.68s)]
*  Here's my quick reaction. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=534.56s)]
*  Still a little gussied up from being on TV where I was talking about exactly this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=536.4s)]
*  So I hope you appreciate the extra effort. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=539.84s)]
*  But basically, the Fed started raising interest rates in March of 2022 to battle inflation. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=542.12s)]
*  They raised rates 11 times since then. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=548.6s)]
*  But for about a year and a half now, they've been held at around 5%. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=551.04s)]
*  And the question was, when is the Fed going to cut? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, they were waiting for prices to fall sufficiently to feel [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=557.64s)]
*  that the threat of inflation had been contained. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=561.0s)]
*  Now, if only there was another deflationary mechanism, you know, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=563.32s)]
*  beyond monetary policy, I just I don't [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=567.96s)]
*  I can't really think of any alternatives. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=571.88s)]
*  Can you guys is there is there anything else other than the monetary policy [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=574.76s)]
*  to engage in any sort of like deflationary mechanism? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's right. It's called fiscal policy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=585.24s)]
*  That's the other side of this process that is oftentimes forgotten. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=588.36s)]
*  Well, fiscal fiscal policy requires legislative action. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=592.68s)]
*  And obviously, obviously, when the legislative branch of the government is completely gutted [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=597.0s)]
*  and obstructionist policies, obstructionist principles from one party or the other, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=604.12s)]
*  especially when it comes to deflationary mechanisms, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=610.48s)]
*  which would probably increase taxes, for example, or even like any kind of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  anti-capitalist measures in terms of this could be, I guess, the federal agencies [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=618.24s)]
*  engaging in antitrust initiatives. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=624.36s)]
*  It could mean it could mean tax. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=627.44s)]
*  Like I said, it could mean increasing taxes. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=629.96s)]
*  It can even mean something like instituting price controls, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=631.68s)]
*  you know, all that sort of stuff. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=636.84s)]
*  When when neither party has the appetite to push for these kinds of bold, radical ideas, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=639.08s)]
*  and neither party actually ever gets punished for being obstructionist. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=645.8s)]
*  And by neither party, I mean, the Republicans don't ever get punished for being obstructionist. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=650.28s)]
*  Obviously, there is no there's no alternative. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=653.7199999999999s)]
*  The only thing you have in your hands, the only thing that remains is monetary policy, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  because it's not controlled technically by anything but I guess market pressure, market movements. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=662.28s)]
*  There is no there's no direct government intervention there. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=670.5999999999999s)]
*  So that's the only that's the that's the only tool that the American government has [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=674.3599999999999s)]
*  to deal with such a thing to deal with inflation. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=680.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, if it were left up, left up the Trump, he would also take over that part as well. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=685.0s)]
*  Now that prices are at two point five percent, as we found out last month, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=689.56s)]
*  it feels like we reached that milestone. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=693.24s)]
*  But in the meantime, the labor market has been showing more and more signs of distress. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=695.0s)]
*  Unemployment rate has been rising for about a year. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=699.64s)]
*  And ever since the Fed started raising interest rates way back in March of twenty two, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=702.1999999999999s)]
*  hiring has fallen. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=707.32s)]
*  And pretty much every month since then, the number of people [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=708.6s)]
*  fiscal policies sound a bit neoliberal. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=711.6400000000001s)]
*  What? No, it's just what are you talking about? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=713.72s)]
*  That's just simply the term for it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=715.8000000000001s)]
*  Fiscal policies are policies that the government has at its disposal to engage in inflationary [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=718.5200000000001s)]
*  or deflationary mechanisms. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=724.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's a broad range of things that the legislative body could do or the federal [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=726.6800000000001s)]
*  regulatory agencies could do. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=731.48s)]
*  Whereas monetary policy is in the hands of the Fed. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=733.72s)]
*  That's it. It's a generic term. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  It's not like neoliberal. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=740.2s)]
*  People hired into a new job and the rate of hiring in our economy has been falling, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=741.8000000000001s)]
*  getting to dangerously low levels that would indicate recession. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=746.36s)]
*  Of course, the only reason why we're not in a recession [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=749.88s)]
*  was because layoffs have not ticked up at all. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=752.2800000000001s)]
*  You mean that most employers are holding on to the employees they have, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=754.6800000000001s)]
*  but they're not quickly expanding their payrolls. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=757.96s)]
*  It's a really tenuous time for the labor market. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=760.36s)]
*  The question for today was how much are they going to cut rates by? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=763.48s)]
*  If it was 50 points versus 25 points really signals how committed the Fed is to the labor market. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  50 points is what I thought the data suggested and what I had just said on TV, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=774.44s)]
*  that if you look at hiring, if you look at the number of jobs added, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=777.96s)]
*  if you look at the change in the unemployment rate, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=780.6s)]
*  the Fed has little room for maneuvering here. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  They have to cut by 50 just to make sure that they telegraph to everyone that the labor market [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  matters and that what workers are going through matters. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=789.8000000000001s)]
*  Employers have made it through this bite against inflation without cutting jobs, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=792.76s)]
*  but we don't know how much longer they're going to wait to do that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=797.8s)]
*  So this was a good signal. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=800.2s)]
*  A lot of people thought maybe they would go for 25 instead. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=802.04s)]
*  The reason for that though was not so much about data as it was narrative. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=805.3199999999999s)]
*  If they go by 50, does it look like they're helping Kamala? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=809.48s)]
*  If they go by 50, does it look like they're actually panicking? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=811.96s)]
*  If they go by 50, is that just because what the market wants? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=814.76s)]
*  The data indicated they should cut by 50. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=817.56s)]
*  The narrative indicated that they might cut by 25. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=820.12s)]
*  But they went with 50. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=822.76s)]
*  I'm really happy they did. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=824.12s)]
*  It's going to show kind of an immediate effect in interest rates. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=825.56s)]
*  The stock market's probably going to go up by a lot to the extent that that matters to you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=829.48s)]
*  But it's a really good signal to send to employers that borrowing is about to become cheaper. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=834.04s)]
*  And hopefully they're going to respond by expanding their payrolls because that is what [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=838.52s)]
*  the labor market needs right now. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=842.36s)]
*  But I thought they were hiring a lot. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=843.96s)]
*  I just don't understand it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=846.04s)]
*  Not these last round of jobs numbers, which caused the Fed to respond in the way that they did. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=848.04s)]
*  But for the past couple of years, we've been hearing that hiring is back on the menu. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=855.56s)]
*  There's so many readily available jobs out there. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=860.36s)]
*  It's so the situation in the job market is so dire that it led to people considering [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=863.0s)]
*  a new term, I guess, or maybe it was an old term is new to me, ghost jobs. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=868.76s)]
*  The notion that like a company wants to make it seem like they're hiring is though they're expanding, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=873.48s)]
*  but they're not actually hiring. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=878.9200000000001s)]
*  I work in finance, not even close. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=881.08s)]
*  I literally have you playing in the background. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=883.4s)]
*  I'm playing for a second job while being a full time student. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=884.76s)]
*  Low paying jobs are open mid to high paying jobs aren't. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=887.24s)]
*  Anyway, that's what's been happening to me is I got laid off last January, at least 35% [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=890.6800000000001s)]
*  of HR professionals have admitted to posting ghost jobs according to surveys. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=895.24s)]
*  What? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=899.08s)]
*  Show me the data. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=899.96s)]
*  I would like to look into that. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=901.16s)]
*  I think a lot of this stuff. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=902.76s)]
*  I think a lot of this stuff is just fake in general because of the financialized aspect [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=905.32s)]
*  of our entire economy. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=910.2s)]
*  It's more so just about like confidence in a stock and the way that most corporations [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=911.72s)]
*  move is not about like widgets in a widget factory and who gets to produce those widgets [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=917.96s)]
*  any longer. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=923.64s)]
*  It's not about like the way that the company moves. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=924.44s)]
*  It's not like that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=927.7199999999999s)]
*  It's more so just confidence. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  People will yell at me and say I'm wrong for this and say classic socialist doesn't know [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=938.52s)]
*  enough about the economy. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=942.6s)]
*  And I agree. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=943.8s)]
*  Certainly not my strong suit. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=945.0s)]
*  But when I look at this stuff, I personally see what is this? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=947.4s)]
*  Thanks for skipping my message. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=953.56s)]
*  You know, it's really going to suck if the people who love their comfy life are going [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=955.16s)]
*  to have to go back to backbreaking work. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=957.7199999999999s)]
*  Did you hear the boot? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=959.4s)]
*  And they when he said the Fed cut interest rates, I didn't skip your message. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=960.76s)]
*  I watched the video looking for workers are struggling. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=963.88s)]
*  Headhunters are making it even harder. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=966.1999999999999s)]
*  More and more than eight in 10 recruiters say they post ghost jobs. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=967.7199999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=971.8s)]
*  But hey, if the company has job openings that kind of cuts away at the layoff that cuts [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=972.92s)]
*  away at the layoffs and the impact of the layoffs might have, it just simply looks like [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=978.6s)]
*  they're restructuring. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=983.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, it just simply looks like they are restructuring. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=984.6s)]
*  So it's not as bad as like the company is actually doing horribly. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=988.0400000000001s)]
*  So it's probably a way to withstand additional market scrutiny. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=992.12s)]
*  And no, they fire the high salaried employees and hire lower at lower salaries. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=999.24s)]
*  They don't even do that with the way technological improvements work. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1005.08s)]
*  And especially with like additional pressure attached to your loss of job in the United [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1008.84s)]
*  States of America, which implies that you'll lose in many instances, your visa status. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1014.92s)]
*  If you're an H if you're if you're a visa employee or your health care or, you know, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1021.3199999999999s)]

*  due to having no safety nets that will catch you if you fall Americans can be forced to work [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1041.8s)]

*  You can be as productive as as two employees would be. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1050.52s)]
*  This allows companies to engage in layoffs. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1054.28s)]
*  There's also offshoring. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1058.4399999999998s)]
*  There's also AI. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1060.4399999999998s)]
*  You're wrong. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1062.2s)]
*  Tech companies are doing that, including the one I work for. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1062.76s)]
*  Yeah, most companies will do this. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1065.32s)]
*  And my current job, they did layoffs and basically laid a bunch of people off, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1067.72s)]
*  open a bunch of job postings that they obviously have no interest in filling. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1070.52s)]
*  It's been months and they're just ramping up the burden on individuals. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1072.92s)]
*  Yeah, corporations will do this. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1075.88s)]
*  It's called eliminating redundancies in corporate speak. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1078.1200000000001s)]
*  But the elimination of redundancies do not always reflect positively in your stock prices. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1082.44s)]
*  Usually does, though, but in an effort to offset in an effort to offset any kind of like negative [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1087.88s)]
*  consequences that you might incur on your stock prices, then you make it seem like you're expanding. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1094.1200000000001s)]
*  This is at the heart of many of the this is this is one of the problems that that many labor unions [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1105.96s)]
*  engage with. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1113.5600000000002s)]
*  Specifically, one example I'll use is nursing unions. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1114.36s)]
*  Nurses unions oftentimes either go on strike due to the fact that both in the UK and also [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1118.04s)]
*  in the United States of America, nursing unions regularly go and demonstrate or go on strike [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1127.1599999999999s)]
*  all around the country. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1134.52s)]
*  The reason for why they do that or the demands that they have usually is to hire more nurses. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1136.28s)]
*  Because nurses are overworked. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1142.2s)]
*  They can't get paid leave. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1144.36s)]
*  They can't get time off. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1146.12s)]
*  And the nurse to patient ratio goes up or sorry, the patient to nurse ratio goes up year over year. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1147.72s)]
*  This also obviously makes their output worse in general. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1155.6399999999999s)]
*  If you're a nurse and you're taking care of four patients as opposed to now 10 patients, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1161.1599999999999s)]
*  you're going to do a better job taking care of four patients. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1166.36s)]
*  Okay, if there is if the hospital network, which is what they are, which is what they usually do [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1169.72s)]
*  for the record, if the hospital network looks at that and goes, oh, you guys are striking. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1177.64s)]
*  Okay, we're going to hire more traveling nurses. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1181.96s)]
*  We're going to get scabs. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1184.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1185.72s)]
*  And we're going to weather the storm, which is what many hospitals do. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1186.3600000000001s)]
*  Inevitably, you will have to be you will have to you'll be forced back into making [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1191.0s)]
*  concessions not getting even half of the demands that you've made and getting the back to work. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1198.44s)]
*  Hospitals would rather spend a ton more on traveling nurses than actually give the existing [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1204.68s)]
*  full-time nurses and their staff the very reasonable demands that they make. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1211.0s)]
*  This is just one aspect of the labor force, but it happens everywhere. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1216.2s)]
*  Okay, it happens everywhere. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1220.0400000000002s)]
*  A lot of people are asking for more people to be hired. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1222.76s)]
*  Why are they asking for more people to be hired while keeping the pay rates the same or maybe a [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1227.24s)]
*  little bit better? It's because they want like less of a workload. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1231.72s)]
*  This is one of the more this is one of the unnoticed aspects, which is why a lot of leftists [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1237.64s)]
*  will look at productivity and then compare it to wage stagnation because in comparison to [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1242.6s)]
*  productivity skyrocketing over the course of the last 30-40 years, wages have remained completely [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1249.16s)]
*  stagnant and in the process when productivity goes up but wages remain stagnant, profits go up [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1256.2s)]
*  and when profits go up, there is more cash on hand for companies to engage in what used to be [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1262.76s)]
*  illegal but is now totally legal and valid. What used to be considered market manipulation but is [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1270.2s)]
*  now totally invalid stock buybacks and if they're not going to do stock buybacks oftentimes they'll [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1276.44s)]
*  invest in R&D but that R&D under normal conditions is supposed to make it easier. It's supposed to [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1282.36s)]
*  lighten the burden of the existing labor force but all of that money that goes into R&D that goes [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1289.08s)]
*  into automation will actually be used to reduce the size of the labor force because if you have [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1296.84s)]
*  better technological improvements in your productive output you can simply make three guys do the work [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1304.28s)]
*  that previously ten guys used to do. This is how it works. We're watching the big boy speak. Who's [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1312.2s)]
*  the big boy? What's the point of these fake job offers then? Fake job offers simply make it seem [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1318.52s)]
*  as though the company is not in in dire in a dire circumstance. Makes it seem like the company is [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1323.16s)]
*  still growing. Makes it seem like there's still you know the company's still generating better [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1329.64s)]
*  revenue than projected and that they need more people to come in. They need more people to come [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1335.56s)]
*  in and work. It's a way to improve their standing in the market. Oh man we have like 500 job openings. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1340.84s)]
*  We need people. We need people to work these jobs. It's crazy. It's a form of market manipulation. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1351.8799999999999s)]
*  Basically everything is a form of market manipulation. That way you can also tell your [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1356.6799999999998s)]

*  other city hospitals reach the last minute deal with their management and it's still perhaps the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1402.3600000000001s)]

*  bargain. Let's look at the Boeing strike and cover that. Boeing in an effort to withstand this strike [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1432.9199999999998s)]

*  for the public. On the west coast 33,000 Boeing workers are in the midst of the largest strike. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1448.68s)]
*  US's largest strike. It's not just wages and benefits at stake. It's the question of whether [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT67F9BnHPQ&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
