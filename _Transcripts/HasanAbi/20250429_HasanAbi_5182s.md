# Trump’s Delusional 100-Day Speech Is Insane | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0)
*  What they fail to realize is it is already, it is already so f***ed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=0.0s)]
*  And we are in the first 100 days. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=7.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=11.0s)]
*  This association with Donald Trump is going to put them on the most, the worst possible position come the Democratic Party primaries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=12.0s)]
*  Because if you are looking at Donald Trump right now in the first 100 days. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=27.0s)]
*  Watch live Trump deliver remarks on his first 100 days in Warren, Michigan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=36.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=39.0s)]
*  My God is live. Let's take a look. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=41.0s)]
*  But I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud hardworking American patriots. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=44.0s)]
*  And we're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=52.0s)]
*  And that's according to many, many people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=64.0s)]
*  This is the best, they say, 100 day start of any president in history. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=68.0s)]
*  And everyone is saying it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=73.0s)]
*  We just, we've just gotten started. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=74.0s)]
*  You haven't even seen anything yet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=77.0s)]
*  It's all just kicking in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=79.0s)]
*  And week by week we're ending illegal immigration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=82.0s)]
*  We're taking back our jobs and protecting our great American auto workers and all of our workers, frankly, we're protecting all of our workers. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=89.0s)]
*  We're restoring the rule of law, which was sort of out the window with this crazy guy we had. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=97.0s)]
*  How the hell did that guy ever become president? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=104.0s)]
*  Could somebody explain to me? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=107.0s)]
*  How the hell did that happen? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=111.0s)]
*  There's my friend, Blacksford Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=113.0s)]
*  I like that guy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=116.0s)]
*  He follows me. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=117.0s)]
*  He follows me. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=120.0s)]
*  We love you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=125.0s)]
*  Your whole group has been so supportive over the years. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=126.0s)]
*  I want to thank you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=130.0s)]
*  I want to. Everyone thinks I pay you a fortune. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=131.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=133.0s)]
*  I don't even know who the hell he is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=134.0s)]
*  I just like him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=135.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=138.0s)]
*  Thank all of the fellows. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=139.0s)]
*  Thank them all. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=141.0s)]
*  But we're ending the inflation nightmare, the worst that we've had probably in the history of our country, getting woke lunacy and transgender insanity the hell out of our government. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=142.0s)]
*  We're stopping the indoctrination of our children, slashing billions and billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=153.0s)]
*  And above all, we're saving the American dream. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=163.0s)]
*  We're making America great again. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=165.0s)]
*  And it's happening fast, too. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=167.0s)]
*  What the world has witnessed in the past 14 weeks is a revolution of common sense. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=172.0s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=177.0s)]
*  Really, we're conservative. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=178.0s)]
*  You're conservative. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=179.0s)]
*  You're liberal, whatever the hell you know what it's all about. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=180.0s)]
*  That's about common sense. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=182.0s)]
*  When you think about it, we're for common sense. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=183.0s)]
*  We like strong borders. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=185.0s)]
*  We like good education. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=187.0s)]
*  We like low interest rates. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=188.0s)]
*  We like being able to buy a beautiful car and now deduct the interest on the loan that's never happened before. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=189.0s)]
*  We want a strong military power. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=200.0s)]
*  We want to have a strong military power. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=202.0s)]

*  We want a strong military. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=206.0s)]
*  We want low taxes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=208.0s)]
*  You know, the Democrats, they campaign on. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=209.0s)]
*  We will raise your dude. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=211.0s)]
*  People that still believe this type of shit are they're giving they're giving Japanese Imperial Force commander still stealing food from Filipino houses. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=213.0s)]
*  Twenty nine years after the war. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=227.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=229.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=230.0s)]
*  They're literally 100 days in. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=231.0s)]
*  They're getting absolutely coms. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=233.0s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, so much excitement. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=235.0s)]
*  We're fucking killing it, sir. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=239.0s)]
*  It's it's a you're fucking in a fantastical universe. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=242.0s)]
*  You're not in ours at this point. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=246.0s)]
*  We had just a couple of just to make sure because, you know, every once in a while you have a grandstand, a Republican. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=248.0s)]
*  We have some grandstanders, but every once in a while, not many, not many. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=253.0s)]
*  But remember who those grandstanders were and vote them the hell out of office. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=258.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=262.0s)]
*  Will you do that? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=263.0s)]
*  Vote him out of office. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=267.0s)]
*  You know, they do it a morally. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=269.0s)]
*  They're morally bad. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=272.0s)]
*  You know what the answer is? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=273.0s)]
*  If you don't get it, you're going to have the highest tax increase in history instead of the greatest tax cut in history. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=274.0s)]
*  If the Democrats bill, you get a 58 percent tax increase. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=280.0s)]
*  Would you like that? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=285.0s)]
*  These are the Democrats. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=286.0s)]
*  But I've never seen all the years they campaign. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=289.0s)]
*  We will raise your taxes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=292.0s)]
*  I say, what do this place has gone? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=294.0s)]
*  This country has gone crazy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=297.0s)]
*  And today they did it again. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=299.0s)]
*  Some guy that I'd never heard of, John James, is he a congressman? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=301.0s)]
*  This guy, he said, he said, Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to start the impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=306.0s)]
*  What the hell did I do? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=314.0s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=315.0s)]
*  They want to impeach me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=316.0s)]
*  This lunatic. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=318.0s)]
*  This lunatic. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=321.0s)]
*  He was up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=323.0s)]
*  Actually, I had the television way down and I said to our great first lady, listen, did I just hear I was being impeached again? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=324.0s)]
*  We're getting good at this, though. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=332.0s)]
*  No, they've gone totally crazy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=334.0s)]
*  These people. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=336.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=337.0s)]
*  They've totally lost their confidence. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=338.0s)]
*  They can't even tell a lunatic like this dumb guy that said it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=340.0s)]
*  And then you have the other one that's always with the cane. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=345.0s)]
*  He's always impeaching you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=347.0s)]
*  He raises his cane. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=349.0s)]
*  He always impeaches. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=351.0s)]
*  But they have no control over those people. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=352.0s)]
*  They have no control. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=354.0s)]
*  And the reason is they've lost their confidence. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=355.0s)]
*  They have no confidence anymore as a party. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=358.0s)]
*  They have no candidates. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=360.0s)]
*  And you know, when they say that Bernie, Bernie's probably the best they have. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=362.0s)]
*  By the way, he's about seven years older than me, more. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=367.0s)]
*  Eight years old. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=370.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=371.0s)]
*  Yo, that's one thing I got to give him credit. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=372.0s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=374.0s)]
*  You're hurt. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=375.0s)]
*  You're hurt. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=376.0s)]
*  Hurt people hurt people. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=377.0s)]
*  He's going around with AOC plus three. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=378.0s)]
*  Plus three follow. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=381.0s)]
*  They hang on for little bits. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=382.0s)]
*  They hang on for nuggets. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=384.0s)]
*  And they get crowds. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=387.0s)]
*  They say, oh, the crowd was our crowds are so much bigger than their crowds. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=388.0s)]
*  Crowds are small. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=392.0s)]
*  If I ever had a crowd like their biggest crowd, they'd say it's over for Trump. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=393.0s)]
*  He's lost the magic. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=397.0s)]
*  But this is great. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=399.0s)]
*  And all the people outside, we love you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=400.0s)]
*  We put screens up. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=402.0s)]
*  We're taking back our country from a sick political class that got rich selling America out and bleeding America dry. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=404.0s)]
*  We don't let that happen anymore. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=413.0s)]
*  And we had four great years. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=416.0s)]
*  We're the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=418.0s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 percent. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=420.0s)]
*  We did great. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=422.0s)]
*  And we're going to do better now because now we're really we learned a little bit after years of leaders who sent your money to defend the borders of distant foreign nations. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=423.0s)]
*  That's what we did. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=434.0s)]
*  We'd fight for other nations, but not for ourselves. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=435.0s)]
*  You finally have a president who is defending our borders and our nation. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=438.0s)]
*  After decades of politicians who destroyed Detroit to build up Beijing, you finally have a champion for workers in the White House. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=442.0s)]
*  And instead of putting China first, I'm putting Michigan first and I'm putting America first. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=455.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=461.0s)]
*  I saw the big Gretch. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=463.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=465.0s)]
*  How does this keep happening? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=466.0s)]
*  I was just looking at this on the other monitor. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=468.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=471.0s)]
*  Well, I hadn't planned to speak, but I'm on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and serve so honorably on behalf of the state of Michigan. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=474.0s)]
*  I am really damn happy we're here to celebrate. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=483.0s)]
*  She's so cooked. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=486.0s)]
*  There is 0% chance. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=488.0s)]
*  There is 0% fucking chance. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=491.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=493.0s)]
*  She is so cooked. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=496.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, dude. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=498.0s)]
*  This let me tell you something. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=500.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=502.0s)]
*  Right now, her and Gavin have this dipshit perspective where they're going to be like, oh, my God, I'm going to be the president of the United States. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=503.0s)]
*  Let me tell you something. Okay. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=511.0s)]
*  Right now, her and Gavin have this dipshit perspective where they think that capitulating to right-wing framing and like teasing a teasing a collaborative effort with Trump because he's the president is actually going to is actually going to pay out for them when they run for president. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=512.0s)]
*  What they fail to realize is it is already it is already so and we are in the first 100 days. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=537.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=547.0s)]
*  This association with Donald Trump is going to put them on the most the worst possible position come the Democratic Party primaries. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=548.0s)]
*  Because if you are looking at Donald Trump right now in the first 100 days and you're saying it's fine like me caving on this stuff optically coming out and showing some semblance of support to this guy is actually good. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=563.0s)]
*  When you haven't read Trump has been so far and how unpopular Trump is right now. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=580.0s)]
*  Oh, buddy, there is no way out of this fucking hole. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=587.0s)]
*  People are going to I think look back at this and be like you are shaking hands with Adolf Hitler. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=593.0s)]
*  You are shaking hands with Adolf Hitler with Adolf Pootler. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=597.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=601.0s)]
*  This is completely unacceptable. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=603.0s)]
*  I think history will not look fondly at this kind of this optical this this optics L. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=605.0s)]
*  This recapitalization itself rich. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=614.0s)]
*  It's crucial for the Michigan economy. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=616.0s)]
*  It's crucial for the men and women here for our homeland security and our future. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=618.0s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=622.0s)]
*  I'm so so grateful that this announcement was made today and I appreciate all the work. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=624.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=629.0s)]
*  It's good. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=630.0s)]
*  I'm glad that she's doing this because this is very quickly causing me to you know this right here. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=631.0s)]
*  If you think like AOC's instincts were bad for hugging the Biden administration and even lying on behalf of the Biden administration saying they're working tirelessly around the clock for a ceasefire right like that was a major L right. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=638.0s)]
*  That's a regrettable perhaps even unforgettable L. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=653.0s)]
*  This is that times a fucking million. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=658.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=663.0s)]
*  This is that times seven million like this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=664.0s)]
*  This is who she is so bad is so bad. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=667.0s)]
*  I think this straight up shows that these are depraved little freaks that only want like a glimmer of power. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=672.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=680.0s)]
*  He said oh can we get Josh to do this too. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=681.0s)]
*  Josh Shapiro I think is a little bit smarter than that but maybe I'm wrong. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=683.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=687.0s)]
*  I think Josh Shapiro will on the legislative side as the governor push for right wing bills and shit but I don't know if he is I don't know if he's dumb enough to come out and show support for come out and show support for Trump like physically. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=688.0s)]
*  You don't want those photos being unearthed during the primary season especially when think about the first 100 days and then think that we have 1200 more days of this. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=704.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=715.0s)]
*  We have 1200 more days of this. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=716.0s)]
*  I don't think Pete Buttigieg would do this. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=718.0s)]
*  I don't think people judge would do this. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=720.0s)]
*  I don't think people just dumb enough to fucking cloud chase like this. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=722.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=726.0s)]
*  So from not watching the whole clip I think is important to try to deal with Trump like how he deals with Kim Jong-un purely for optics and trying to win his supporters over but also not feeding into conservatives and propaganda. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=727.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=736.0s)]
*  I'm just a dumb college kid studying for finals law. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=737.0s)]
*  No no no no no no no no especially when his popularity is cratering chatter. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=738.0s)]
*  Is his popularity is fucking cratering. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=745.0s)]
*  It's not like he's a he's above 50 percent right now. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=747.0s)]
*  He is the least popular he's ever been in his career. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=750.0s)]
*  He's the least popular any president has been at this point. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=753.0s)]
*  He is right now the least popular any president has been 100 days in and you're over there fucking doing photo shoots with him. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=756.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=764.0s)]
*  Oh this is dumb enough as it is before. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=765.0s)]
*  Like even if it wasn't Trump and if it was another unpopular Republican like this I think it would be a major mistake for a blue state governor to do this. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=770.0s)]
*  What happened. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=777.0s)]
*  And I knew nothing about her. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=779.0s)]
*  She was vice president but nobody knew a damn thing about her. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=780.0s)]
*  She had nothing to do with the border even though she was appointed though just made numbers. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=783.0s)]
*  All of the great people Paul and true. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=788.0s)]
*  Look look behind him. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=791.0s)]
*  Everyone loves him. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=792.0s)]
*  Obviously that's just fake news. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=793.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=796.0s)]
*  Yeah I'll check back with you chatter in a little bit. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=797.0s)]
*  OK I'll check back with you chatter in like 10 to 15 days. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=799.0s)]
*  OK come back in here in 10 to 15 days and remind me how you feel of Donald Trump when you go to the fucking grocery store and half of the shelves are empty and you're like how the fuck did this happen. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=804.0s)]
*  Good right. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=816.0s)]
*  We won the 24. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=817.0s)]
*  The radical left Democrats would right now be importing the next 10 million invaders and giving amnesty to 30 or 40 million illegals many of them criminals many of them frankly murderers and people of crime at the absolute people of crime. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=822.0s)]
*  People of crime. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=839.0s)]
*  It would only be a matter of years or months until the market itself became a failed third world nation. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=843.0s)]
*  We were that was happening because we're going to be a third world nation. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=849.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what if these guys won if this group of radical lunatics and by the way you know Biden we find out that whoever operated the auto pen was the real president and Biden do nothing about it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=852.0s)]
*  You know we had a group of radical left guys who were very smart and a woman a particular woman very very smart people. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=866.0s)]
*  These are not stupid people. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=874.0s)]
*  These are sick people but they're not stupid people and they were very smart. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=875.0s)]
*  What they're best at is cheating at election. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=879.0s)]
*  They cheat on elections. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=882.0s)]
*  That's their single greatest trait. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=884.0s)]
*  They cheat like hell. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=886.0s)]
*  And let me tell you they tried to cheat on this election but we made it too big to rig. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=888.0s)]
*  Remember too big. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=893.0s)]
*  They tried. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=894.0s)]
*  I watched those numbers. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=900.0s)]
*  I watched those numbers. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=903.0s)]
*  We had Elon with us. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=905.0s)]
*  Elon is a smart guy. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=906.0s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=908.0s)]
*  And I was sitting with Dana White and Elon Musk and I'm watching the numbers in Pennsylvania and we're winning so easily then all of a sudden it flatlined. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=913.0s)]
*  And I said you know I said I think they're cheating again. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=922.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=926.0s)]
*  What's going on. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=927.0s)]
*  I think they're cheating again. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=928.0s)]
*  And Elon looked at us. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=929.0s)]
*  He goes no you're going to win. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=930.0s)]
*  They just don't know it yet. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=933.0s)]
*  And about 15 minutes later we won. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=934.0s)]
*  You know sort of crazy. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=936.0s)]
*  I'll never again. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=939.0s)]
*  You're going to win. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=940.0s)]
*  They just don't know it yet. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=941.0s)]
*  But you know what we made it too big to rig. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=942.0s)]
*  It was too big. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=945.0s)]
*  Starting on day one I deployed the U.S. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=946.0s)]
*  military to defend our country from the invasion of our border. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=949.0s)]
*  I shut down all migrant flights. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=954.0s)]
*  Do you remember when we're talking about people coming in they're trying to deny it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=956.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=961.0s)]
*  So people are flowing in this. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=962.0s)]
*  And I don't see any people. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=963.0s)]
*  It's like what's wrong. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=964.0s)]
*  But then we saw airplanes going overhead. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=965.0s)]
*  We said what the hell are those airplanes doing. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=968.0s)]
*  Big Boeing seven fifty sevens were traveling right overhead loaded up with people. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=970.0s)]
*  I say where the hell are those planes going. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=975.0s)]
*  They were loaded up with migrants coming in illegally flying in by plane paid for by [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=977.0s)]
*  the U.S. government. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=982.0s)]
*  I'll tell you they are they are sick. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=984.0s)]
*  You remember that day. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=988.0s)]
*  That was the day we found out that not only do we have to defend it here we have to defend [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=989.0s)]
*  it not only in the water but we have to defend it in the air. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=993.0s)]
*  The planes were going over. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=996.0s)]
*  I said what the hell is that. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=997.0s)]
*  I banned all welfare to illegals and I signed an order that will lend order to the U.S. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1000.0s)]
*  government. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1004.0s)]
*  I signed an order that will lend automatic citizenship for the children of illegal aliens. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1005.0s)]
*  No citizenship for years. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1010.0s)]
*  Joe Biden and the media told us that stopping the flood of illegal immigration was absolutely [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1012.0s)]

*  They say, Trump only has a 44% approval rating. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1626.0s)]
*  Well, it's actually not bad. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1630.0s)]
*  You figure that if it were a legit poll, it would be in the 60s or 70s. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1632.0s)]
*  These people are a bunch of crooked people. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1636.0s)]
*  Now, they interview more Democrats than Republicans. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1640.0s)]
*  In other words, they take the poll, and they interview Democrats. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1644.0s)]
*  They say they try and depress it as much, just like they write bad stories. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1647.0s)]
*  97% of the stories written about me, think of it, were negative. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1652.0s)]
*  And yet, we won in a landslide because they have no credibility. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1658.0s)]
*  And also, we cannot allow a handful of communist, radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1669.0s)]
*  of our laws and assume the duties that belong solely to the President of the United States. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1674.0s)]
*  Judges are trying to take away the power given to the President to keep our country safe. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1680.0s)]
*  And it's not a good thing, but I hope for the sake of our country that the Supreme Court [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1687.0s)]
*  is going to save this because we have to do something. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1694.0s)]
*  These people are just looking to destroy our country. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1697.0s)]
*  Nothing will stop me and the mission to keep America safe again. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1701.0s)]
*  It's very simple. Keep America safe again. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1705.0s)]
*  And our first 100 days have also produced historic results in the battle to defeat [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1711.0s)]
*  Biden's inflation disaster and bring jobs and wealth back to America, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1716.0s)]
*  and bring them back to Michigan, okay? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1720.0s)]
*  We want to bring them back. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1723.0s)]
*  As an example, since I took office, the cost of eggs is down 87%. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1727.0s)]
*  Now, right? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1733.0s)]
*  You remember a few weeks ago, before Thanksgiving, before we heard about it, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1735.0s)]
*  I heard about it a long time ago. Before Thanksgiving, I heard about it. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1740.0s)]
*  And then I was hearing that I wasn't President. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1744.0s)]
*  This guy was barely President. Nobody knew, was he President? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1747.0s)]
*  Who the hell was President? To this day, I say it was the one that operated the auto pen, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1750.0s)]
*  but what do I know? But I was hearing about eggs, and then all of a sudden we have a great election victory. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1755.0s)]
*  And my first week in office, they start screaming at me, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1761.0s)]
*  What about the price of eggs? Eggs? Eggs? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1765.0s)]
*  I said, I've only been here for six days. I was there six days. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1768.0s)]
*  What's wrong with eggs? They said, the price of eggs has gone through the roof, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1772.0s)]
*  and you won't be able to have them for Easter. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1776.0s)]
*  So I put a very capable, Brooke Rollins, who's our wonderful commissioner of agriculture that you know in Michigan. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1778.0s)]
*  I said, Brooke, I've only been here six days before I heard. Maybe even less, maybe five, maybe four. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1787.0s)]
*  But it was my first week, and I said, Brooke, you've got to save me here. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1795.0s)]
*  I was being killed about eggs. What the hell's going on with eggs? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1799.0s)]
*  She said, Well, you can't get them. The price is through the roof, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1802.0s)]
*  and it looks like we're going to have a real problem for Easter. You're not going to have eggs. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1805.0s)]
*  I said, Brooke, that doesn't sound politically viable to me. That doesn't sound good. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1808.0s)]
*  Because nobody's going to believe me when you get out there that it's Sleepy Joe Biden's fault. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1813.0s)]
*  So, Brooke, you got to get going, Brooke, please. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1818.0s)]
*  And she did a great job. And you had so many eggs for Easter, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1822.0s)]
*  and your price was down 87 percent from. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1826.0s)]
*  Prices are coming way down. You know, the fake news doesn't say. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1832.0s)]
*  They said he pledged. Now, I pledged safe borders. I pledged all sorts of things. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1835.0s)]
*  But they said he pledged to bring prices down. Well, that's what I've done. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1840.0s)]
*  They're trying to say the prices have gone up. Your energy, your car, your gasoline. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1844.0s)]
*  And they have three states this week, a couple of days ago, that were one dollar and 98 cents a gallon. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1849.0s)]
*  So gasoline prices are down by a lot. Energy prices are down. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1859.0s)]
*  Mortgage rates actually just went down. Prescription drug prices just saw their largest. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1865.0s)]
*  No, energy prices are down due to, I mean, a multitude of different reasons. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1871.0s)]
*  But remember what you heard? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1876.0s)]
*  Energy prices are down in comparison to where they used to be. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1878.0s)]
*  But that's pretty much it. The biggest plunge ever since they've recorded the prices, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1881.0s)]
*  which have basically gone up except for my four years. They did pretty well. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1887.0s)]
*  But why have you stopped back checking in when he says clearly incorrect stuff? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1890.0s)]
*  Dude, I would not be able to you think I'm capable physically of stopping time. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1894.0s)]
*  A one hour speech would require me to do eight and a half hours of consistent fact checking. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1903.0s)]
*  His lie per minute is like 68. Probably even worse than CNN. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1908.0s)]
*  It's probably worse. Probably worse than CNN. What the fuck? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1914.0s)]
*  I saw this this horrible, horrible anchor. How these people get jobs. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1919.0s)]
*  I wouldn't hire them to do the most menial of chores. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1924.0s)]
*  But I saw this person he campaigned on bringing prices down. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1928.0s)]
*  Every price has gone down. What am I going to do? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1932.0s)]
*  I mean, think of it. Gasoline was almost four dollars not so long ago. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1934.0s)]
*  And now, Mike, we just hit one ninety eight in a lot of states. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1940.0s)]
*  Think of it. And they're saying and you know what? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1944.0s)]
*  And inflation is basically down and interest rates came down despite the fact that I have a fed person who's not really doing a good job. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1949.0s)]
*  But I won't say that. I want to be very nice. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1957.0s)]
*  I want to be very nice and respectful to the Fed. Data from the energy shows national average three. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1960.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to criticize the Fed. You're supposed to let him do his own thing. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1965.0s)]
*  But I know much more than he does about interest rates. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1968.0s)]
*  Believe me, core inflation has reached the lowest rate in four years. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1970.0s)]
*  And last month, we had the largest drop in consumer prices since the pandemic. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1975.0s)]
*  This is all done in a hundred days. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1980.0s)]
*  Energy is down to sixty four a barrel. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1983.0s)]
*  Think of that. This is all done in a hundred days. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1986.0s)]
*  Crew was about sixty four a barrel on April twenty eight. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1989.0s)]
*  But he exaggerated the price of the time, which was about eighty. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1991.0s)]
*  Yes, that part is correct. Democrats and Republican Democrats. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1994.0s)]
*  It went from eighty dollars. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1997.0s)]
*  The price of crude went from eighty dollars to sixty. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=1999.0s)]
*  He's not wrong. When he says one ninety eight, that's false. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2003.0s)]
*  That's a lie. But like he's not wrong in terms of gas prices coming down. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2006.0s)]
*  That's why I said like it's not no way they're saying it went from eighty nine to eighty. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2011.0s)]
*  And he said sixty four. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2015.0s)]
*  But he exaggerated the price of the time he of his. No, no, no. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2017.0s)]
*  He's saying he's saying it went down to sixty four dollars on April twenty eighth. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2019.0s)]
*  And it wasn't eighty nine dollars. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2024.0s)]
*  It was actually eighty dollars when he first came into office. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2026.0s)]
*  You're misunderstanding what their fact check looks like. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2031.0s)]
*  Their fact check is saying it wasn't eighty nine dollars. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2033.0s)]
*  It was eighty dollars, which is like, OK, fine. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2035.0s)]
*  Yeah, he he massage the numbers. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2039.0s)]
*  Trump's misleading claim. Groceries are down. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2041.0s)]
*  Food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2043.0s)]
*  The CPI shows average cost of groceries in March increased by zero point four nine from the previous month of two point four percent compared to the previous year. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2047.0s)]
*  So obviously, yes, grocery prices have not come down. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2056.0s)]
*  I don't think that he's right about that. I say he lies about that all the time. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2059.0s)]
*  No, that's the price of crude oil barrels have gone down. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2063.0s)]
*  They say, well, which means that which which means that the price of gas at the pump is supposed to go down eventually. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2066.0s)]
*  And like like these things, I feel like follow. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2074.0s)]
*  Thank you. It's a it's a lagging indicator. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2077.0s)]
*  Typical Hassan, I mean, protecting rich streamers who who. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2081.0s)]
*  Oh, we've ended the radical left. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2084.0s)]
*  Well, we actually this is why we don't do live fact checking, folks. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2086.0s)]
*  But remember, I like the victories. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2090.0s)]
*  I like the three victories, which we absolutely had. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2093.0s)]
*  I just don't like the results of the middle term. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2096.0s)]
*  The results. I don't want those results, John. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2098.0s)]
*  I don't want those results. What results? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2101.0s)]
*  What a disgrace if we would have had this group for another year, we wouldn't have a country left. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2103.0s)]
*  I really mean it. I don't think we would have a country left. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2109.0s)]
*  And now we're respected all over the world. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2111.0s)]
*  They're coming from all over the world to see your president. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2114.0s)]
*  They're coming from India. They're coming from France. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2119.0s)]
*  They're coming from. We should all celebrate that he tried the new global trade capitulated [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2122.0s)]
*  and had a couple of countries, a couple of countries send trade envoys, which got no deals, by the way. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2128.0s)]
*  And, you know, we'll make deals, which got no fucking deals out of the process, too. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2136.0s)]
*  But he just claims that there are 200 deals that he's already implemented, more deals than there are countries. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2141.0s)]
*  And all of the countries that have supposedly gotten deals out of the Trump administration are saying no deals were made. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2146.0s)]
*  So we lost. Think of this. We lost billions and billions of dollars a day. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2155.0s)]
*  Billions, not millions, billions of dollars a day. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2163.0s)]
*  And under Sleepy Joe Biden, what's better, Crooked Joe or Sleepy Joe? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2168.0s)]
*  Ready? A poll, a free poll, because these pollsters are so corrupt. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2172.0s)]
*  This is a real poll. We're going to poll Crooked Joe or Sleepy Joe. Ready? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2177.0s)]
*  What's a better name for us to call him? Sleepy Joe? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2182.0s)]
*  Still, still hitting on Joe. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2191.0s)]
*  Or Crooked Joe? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2193.0s)]
*  This is a real poll. Unlike the fake polls that have been coming out saying I'm unpopular. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2203.0s)]
*  This is the only real poll that matters. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2208.0s)]
*  Nice ring to it. Because he had one ability I didn't have. He goes to the beach, right? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2210.0s)]
*  And he could fall asleep or to cottage drooling out of the side of his mouth. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2216.0s)]
*  And he'd be sleeping within minutes carrying the aluminum chair, you know, the kind that's meant for old people and children to carry. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2221.0s)]
*  It weighs like about four ounces. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2228.0s)]
*  Dude, I'm telling you, America deserves back to back demented presidents. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2231.0s)]
*  We're doing a triple. We're hitting a triple. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2236.0s)]
*  Like you can say that Trump was kind of losing it on the way out a little bit. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2239.0s)]
*  And then Biden obviously greatly, greatly created a permission structure for having a, having a dottering old fool lead the nation into collapse. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2244.0s)]
*  And Trump has just taken advantage of that. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2255.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Back to back to back different versions of dementia. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2259.0s)]
*  If he was sleeping, I'd be tossing and turning and scheming and thinking and saying, how am I going to beat China? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2263.0s)]
*  How am I going to stop the war with Russia and Ukraine? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2268.0s)]
*  This guy could fall asleep with cameras blazing, right? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2275.0s)]
*  Not too many cameras were blazing, but enough were blazing that you saw it. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2279.0s)]
*  I thought it was a great ability that he had, actually. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2282.0s)]
*  We've ended the radical left war on American energy. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2285.0s)]
*  We've stopped their crusade on coal. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2288.0s)]
*  Did you see what I did the other day? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2290.0s)]
*  Clean, beautiful coal. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2293.0s)]
*  I said, you're not allowed to use the word coal unless you say clean, beautiful coal. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2296.0s)]
*  So you have guys getting up, Department of Energy. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2301.0s)]
*  We have great people at Department of Energy. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2304.0s)]
*  They talk about clean, beautiful coal. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2306.0s)]
*  You know, China uses coal. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2308.0s)]
*  They're opening up a coal plant every week, a massive coal plant. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2310.0s)]
*  But we're not allowed to use it. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2313.0s)]
*  But now we are because last week I gave it absolute total approval. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2314.0s)]
*  And you know what I don't give approval to? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2320.0s)]
*  Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2322.0s)]
*  And we've ended the Green New Scam. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2329.0s)]
*  We've reopened ANWR, the greatest drilling site anywhere in the world, in Alaska, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2331.0s)]
*  and implemented the new energy policy of the United States. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2337.0s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2342.0s)]
*  We have a policy. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2343.0s)]
*  It's called Drill Baby Drill. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2344.0s)]
*  That's our policy. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2348.0s)]
*  That's our policy, Michael, right? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2354.0s)]
*  Great Michael Watley, head of the Republican Party. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2356.0s)]
*  He's done a good job. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2359.0s)]
*  Him and Laura, they took the party by storm, right? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2360.0s)]
*  He had, but he had a good candidate, but had a couple of good candidates, didn't he? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2364.0s)]
*  Michael's been incredible, actually. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2369.0s)]
*  Michael Watley, North Carolina. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2371.0s)]
*  He watched it in 2020. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2373.0s)]
*  He did so good for me. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2376.0s)]
*  And you know, he was in North Carolina. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2377.0s)]
*  He did so great. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2380.0s)]
*  What's the problem over there? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2381.0s)]
*  What's the problem? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2383.0s)]
*  Is that a radical left lunatic? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2384.0s)]
*  He's just a child. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2389.0s)]
*  All right, get him out. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2391.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2392.0s)]
*  Get him out. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2393.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2394.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, ma'am. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2395.0s)]
*  Beat that child's ass. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2396.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2399.0s)]
*  Kill him. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2400.0s)]
*  Kill him dead. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2401.0s)]
*  And she now has to go home to a mother who's a big Trump fan. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2402.0s)]
*  Her mother's watching. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2406.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2408.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2410.0s)]
*  I said he and it's a she. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2412.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2415.0s)]
*  To keep my promise to the great state of Michigan, I terminated Joe Biden's insane electric [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2416.0s)]
*  vehicle and dated to buy an electric vehicle. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2424.0s)]
*  You were mandated within just a few years to buy an electric vehicle. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2430.0s)]
*  How about that? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2437.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2438.0s)]
*  They're great, but people don't not everybody wants them. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2439.0s)]
*  You got to be able to buy a hybrid, a gasoline powered car. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2441.0s)]
*  You can buy lots of different cars, but you can't be mandated to do anything. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2446.0s)]
*  And I've already proudly imposed a 25 percent tariff on all foreign automobiles. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2450.0s)]
*  Any any foreign car like they do, Tom. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2456.0s)]
*  This is going to create more jobs in this state and this country and to help these automakers [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2461.0s)]
*  bring their factories home as rapidly as possible. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2468.0s)]
*  I've just signed an executive order to give partial tariff rebates to any company that [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2471.0s)]
*  assembles its cars right here in the US. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2477.0s)]
*  In other words, in other words, if they can't make it in time because they have to do it [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2479.0s)]
*  here, otherwise, I'm giving them a little bit of a break, right? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2485.0s)]
*  They took in parts from all over the world. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2489.0s)]
*  I don't want that. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2491.0s)]
*  I want them to make their parts here. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2492.0s)]
*  But I gave them a little bit of time. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2493.0s)]
*  It's 15 percent and then 10 percent of the parts. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2496.0s)]
*  So it's not so bad. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2499.0s)]
*  Somebody would say, oh, well, that's a change in parts. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2500.0s)]
*  It's called a little flexibility. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2503.0s)]
*  The guys were crying. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2505.0s)]
*  They love it. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2506.0s)]
*  Everything's good. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2507.0s)]
*  But just in case we can't get everything in time, we gave them a little bit. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2508.0s)]
*  So it's 15 percent of the parts and then it's 10 percent of the parts. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2512.0s)]
*  We give them a little time before we slaughter them if they don't do this. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2515.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2519.0s)]
*  They're going to make so much money. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2520.0s)]
*  They're going to have so many jobs. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2523.0s)]
*  No, but jobs are way up. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2525.0s)]
*  Jobs are way up. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2527.0s)]
*  We're pleased to be joined tonight by Brian Pannebecker. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2529.0s)]
*  Do you know who that is? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2533.0s)]
*  Of the autoworkers for Trump. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2534.0s)]
*  And Brian is a union guy, loves the unions, loves everything. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2537.0s)]
*  But he knew that Trump was right. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2541.0s)]
*  Brian, come up here, Brian. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2543.0s)]
*  I got to see Brian. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2544.0s)]
*  Look at the arms in this guy. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2546.0s)]
*  Look at the arms. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2548.0s)]
*  This guy gets so much play, bro. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2556.0s)]
*  This is the same guy with the head of our mustache, the one union guy that he loves parading around. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2558.0s)]
*  And I just want to remind you of something I told you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2565.0s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm so happy you're nuking global trade. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2568.0s)]
*  I don't need no goddamn Chinese car parts to build cars as an autoworker, Mr. President. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2571.0s)]
*  I'm so excited, sir. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2578.0s)]
*  Except I'm already retired, sir. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2580.0s)]
*  Can you please kill more Mexicans for me so I can feel better about my position in society, sir? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2582.0s)]
*  I love the union benefits that I've gotten, sir. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2588.0s)]
*  But it's awesome that you're actually destroying the remaining unionization rate in this goddamn country. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2591.0s)]
*  So none of these goddamn Gen Z, failenials will ever get a crumb of the sweet, juicy benefits my union fought long and hard for me to survive. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2597.0s)]
*  So I could chirp on the main stage like this, sir. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2610.0s)]
*  You are so good. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2613.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2614.0s)]
*  I only had 10, 15 seconds to say something to him before we got our pictures. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2616.0s)]
*  Fortunately, my son was standing behind me, so I've got a witness to this. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2621.0s)]
*  And I said, Mr. Trump, we've got the keys to the White House waiting for you in Macomb County. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2625.0s)]
*  And he kind of chuckled. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2631.0s)]
*  He said, oh yeah, how's that? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2633.0s)]
*  And I said, well, Macomb County is the home of the Reagan Democrats. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2635.0s)]
*  If you come to Macomb County and you ask for their support and you get it, you might win Macomb County big enough to carry the whole state of Michigan. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2639.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what he did. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2649.0s)]
*  So I want to say thank you to the auto workers, everybody who works in the automotive. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2656.0s)]
*  Hell yes, sir. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2663.0s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2664.0s)]
*  We are not going to have no auto truckers. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2665.0s)]
*  Let me tell you, okay, trucks, not a part of the auto workers. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2668.0s)]
*  So we don't give a fuck that truckers won't have any jobs come this time around next month. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2671.0s)]
*  Why? Because no commerce is moving around these borders. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2678.0s)]
*  Why? Because our glorious president decided to nuke global trade. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2681.0s)]
*  Doesn't mind. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2684.0s)]
*  But when I was backstage with him earlier and got my picture taken, I said, Mr. President, I've got a deal that you can't refuse. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2685.0s)]
*  And he said, what's that? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2694.0s)]
*  And I said, well, I'm writing a book and it's going to be about my political journey. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2696.0s)]
*  I've been involved in some things here in Michigan, conservative causes like Right to Work and the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2700.0s)]
*  And and I said, you have a publishing company winning publishing. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2708.0s)]
*  He's a right to work. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2714.0s)]

*  It's over. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2725.0s)]
*  Dude, dude, dude, dude. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2726.0s)]
*  We're done. We're done. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2727.0s)]
*  It's done. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2728.0s)]
*  The project is done. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2729.0s)]
*  I no longer have any, any fucking hope for America to go anywhere from here other than full tilt fascism. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2731.0s)]
*  You got a whole ass. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2738.0s)]
*  You got a whole ass union representative like representing his auto workers union right now. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2740.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2745.0s)]
*  Who is literally fucking saying that he took a pro right to work position, which is an anti-union position. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2746.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on, dude? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2755.0s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2758.0s)]
*  These guys literally think by the color of their skin, by, by the virtue of their whiteness that they're somehow above the working class. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2759.0s)]
*  I think they think that they're going to get a better bargain in the process. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2767.0s)]
*  This is psychotic. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2771.0s)]
*  Now he is not. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2773.0s)]
*  He is not representative of the average fucking union worker. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2775.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2781.0s)]
*  No matter how right wing or reactionary the average fucking union worker is the rank and filer is this guy's a fucking retired dipshit. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2782.0s)]
*  No matter how right wing anti-trans, whatever reactionary culture warrior a union rank and filer might be the entire fucking virtue of being in a union means that you're not anti right to work. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2788.0s)]

*  He's a great guy. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2822.0s)]
*  You know, he was with me from day one 2015 before 2016. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2823.0s)]
*  He was there from day one. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2828.0s)]
*  He got it. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2829.0s)]
*  He said, we're losing our car industry. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2830.0s)]
*  That's what he really cared about. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2832.0s)]
*  He lost. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2833.0s)]
*  He just said I had so many friends who were laid off. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2834.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2837.0s)]
*  They lay us off like it's nothing. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2838.0s)]
*  And the business went to China. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2839.0s)]
*  It went to Japan, went to all countries all over the world. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2841.0s)]
*  They're laying us off, sir. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2843.0s)]
*  And they said, we can solve that. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2845.0s)]
*  We can solve that. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2846.0s)]
*  I told him we can solve that so fast. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2847.0s)]
*  He's one of the early people that got it. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2848.0s)]
*  And we've solved it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2850.0s)]
*  We're going to be doing numbers that nobody's ever believed. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2851.0s)]
*  We'll be the number one in the world again. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2854.0s)]
*  Nobody can believe it because we have been beaten up so badly by these countries that [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2856.0s)]
*  have rigged the whole thing. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2860.0s)]
*  They fight like hell. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2862.0s)]
*  They're smart. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2863.0s)]
*  Their product is good, but our product is going to be a lot better. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2864.0s)]
*  We're going to do something that nobody believes. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2867.0s)]
*  And he saw it right at the beginning. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2870.0s)]
*  So I appreciated Brian. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2872.0s)]

*  They were there from the beginning. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2879.0s)]
*  Now, you're going to see numbers and you're already seeing them. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2883.0s)]
*  Look, you know, we have many Hondas coming in and they're coming in. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2886.0s)]
*  They can't we let them build their cars here. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2890.0s)]
*  We don't want them to build them in Japan. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2892.0s)]
*  We love Japan. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2894.0s)]
*  We don't want them building them in Japan. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2895.0s)]
*  We want them to build them here. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2896.0s)]
*  We want China to build them in here. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2897.0s)]
*  We want them all to build them right in here. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2899.0s)]
*  That's what they've done to us for 40 years. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2901.0s)]
*  And they've drained us. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2904.0s)]
*  Now we're doing it to them at a better level than they ever dreamed possible. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2905.0s)]
*  To further rebuild the industrial bedrock of our proposed 25 percent tariffs [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2911.0s)]
*  and foreign aluminum and steel. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2915.0s)]
*  It's keeping our steel mills going. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2917.0s)]
*  I did that. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2919.0s)]
*  If I didn't do that with steel in the first, my first term, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2920.0s)]
*  we wouldn't have a steel mill in the United States right now. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2924.0s)]
*  And everybody knows that. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2928.0s)]
*  I did it for washing machines, too, by the way. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2929.0s)]
*  That's why I asked the people at Whirlpool. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2931.0s)]
*  They were going to close. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2933.0s)]
*  They were in deep trouble. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=2934.0s)]

*  You know, if he really went totally crazy, which he'd like to do. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3596.0s)]
*  But I think he's terrific. Scott Jennings. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3599.0s)]
*  Where are you, Scott? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3603.0s)]
*  Come here, Scott. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3608.0s)]
*  This guy really I've watched it for years. I don't know. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3610.0s)]
*  But he likes Trump. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3614.0s)]
*  Come here, Scott. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3616.0s)]
*  Can we hear what Asmins Shatt is saying? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3618.0s)]
*  Oh, CNN. This is the end of Scott. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3619.0s)]
*  Who cares? Don't worry. We'll take care of you, Scott. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3622.0s)]
*  Scott Jennings. Really great. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3625.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3628.0s)]
*  Let's see. Let's see. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3631.0s)]
*  Michigan gold heads are saying we were flying in here today. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3632.0s)]
*  And I said, look at these farms. I got to get a farm in Michigan, because when you own as many libs as I do, you got to put a place to put them all. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3636.0s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3642.0s)]
*  Oh, God, he's such a fucking little nerd. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3644.0s)]
*  And I also want to thank the rest of the Michigan Republican delegation for 100% of what they do in Congress. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3648.0s)]
*  And we're back in Washington working on the big, beautiful bill. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3655.0s)]
*  The big we're going to name it. I think the big, beautiful bill in a hundred days. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3658.0s)]
*  I've taken more than 1000 executive actions and I could recite our accomplishments all night long. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3662.0s)]
*  And by the way, excited to see Scott Jennings truly shows the depravity of the Trump, Trump, mongold hive. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3668.0s)]
*  Your sink. You ever try buying a new sink and no water comes out? Your shower heads, your toilets, the whole thing. It's a disaster. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3676.0s)]
*  We now have it so you can have as much water as you want, because it's not an environmental problem. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3684.0s)]
*  You have areas where you can't get rid of their water and yet they have to put restrictors on it. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3690.0s)]
*  You used to take them off, but now you can't because they're welded in. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3695.0s)]
*  But now you don't have to worry about that because we've opened up your faucets and we've opened up, especially me. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3698.0s)]
*  I don't like taking a shower where the water goes drip, drip, drip onto my luxuriant hair. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3704.0s)]
*  I need a lot of water. I need everything I can get. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3710.0s)]
*  I don't need to be under a shower trying to get water to come out of that damn thing. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3714.0s)]
*  So we've opened up the shower heads, the faucets, the toilets, the washing machines that don't give you water. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3719.0s)]
*  All of that stuff has been opened up and we're giving you gas ovens, gas stoves if you'd like. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3729.0s)]
*  No more electric. You can have electric if you want. I have a lot of friends. They like gas better. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3736.0s)]
*  You're supposed to sell your gas stove or get it. I don't know. Who do you sell it to? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3742.0s)]
*  Maybe another country because we're the only country that would be so stupid to that. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3746.0s)]
*  But the stoves now you can have gas stoves all you want. Put four of them in your kitchen. I couldn't get enough. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3750.0s)]
*  So common sense. People were so angry about that. Remember they were all angry. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3758.0s)]
*  Get rid of your gas stove. You have to go to electric. There's something they have with electric that's amazing. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3762.0s)]
*  And by the way, Elon makes a great car, but not everybody's going to want it. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3768.0s)]
*  You know, they all say, oh, well, Trump is maybe he's under the under the thumb of Elon. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3776.0s)]
*  Do you think Elon was happy about ending the all electric mandate? I don't think he was too happy, but he's a great guy. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3783.0s)]
*  You know, honestly, never said a thing. He says, let me just compete fairly. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3790.0s)]
*  By the way, it's not fair what they've done to him, too. That is a disgrace. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3794.0s)]
*  That is a disgrace, but he's a great guy and he's really helped us. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3799.0s)]
*  And, you know, they've saved one hundred and fifty billion dollars on waste, fraud and abuse. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3803.0s)]
*  He's a great guy. He's got abuse doge. So we want to thank him. He's an incredible guy. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3808.0s)]
*  Anybody that can land a rocket ship. I saw this thing come in and said, you got to be kidding. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3814.0s)]
*  This rocket's coming in. You know, most of them go right into the ocean, but he lands it. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3819.0s)]
*  I was on the phone with somebody talking and I saw this thing coming in and spinning out of control, coming down. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3824.0s)]
*  It's all burning. It's on fire. Looks like hell. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3829.0s)]
*  Well, just another rocket going into the ocean. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3831.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you see the fire pouring out of the engines and it starts to slow up. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3840.0s)]
*  Slow, then it's straight. Then it starts moving over a little bit. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3845.0s)]
*  Then I say, oh, no, it's hitting the gantry. It's going to hit. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3851.0s)]
*  And the engines go, strange enough. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3854.0s)]
*  And it gets hugged like you hug your beautiful little baby. Right. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3858.0s)]
*  And I said, who the hell did that? It was Eli. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3862.0s)]
*  And he told me, you don't have a space program. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3870.0s)]
*  If you have to drop a billion dollar machine into the water every time you fly, you have to save those suckers. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3873.0s)]
*  So he does. He's he's an amazing guy and he's a great American and he loves our country, loves you. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3878.0s)]
*  And he's paid. He's paid a big price to help. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3883.0s)]
*  But I have a feeling it's going to end up being good for him, actually. I really do. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3887.0s)]
*  I established the new presidential commission to make America healthy again, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3891.0s)]
*  chaired by our new secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3895.0s)]
*  He's doing a good job, Dr. Oz. Right. He's doing 900 case of measles, by the way, in Texas. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3901.0s)]
*  First case of measles reported in a child in Florida in California that came from Texas recently. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3907.0s)]
*  The Texas local government is having to do a mass inoculation campaign in an effort to drive up the measles vaccine numbers from the low 80s that it where it's at up to 92 percent. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3912.0s)]
*  So they can effectively curve back the cases of childhood measles. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3926.0s)]
*  Ma part of the funniest, one of the funniest aspects of the measles inoculation campaign is that they're doing it in English, Spanish. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3930.0s)]
*  And what's the what's the language that the fucking Amish or the men the the Mennonite like what do they use? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3940.0s)]
*  Like low Dutch or something is not what it's called. No, they're they're using no, not Yiddish, bro. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3947.0s)]
*  We're talking about Texas. I think it's like low German or Pennsylvania Dutch or something that's called is something like that. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3953.0s)]
*  It's something like that. But like one of the languages is that because many of the communities that are not getting inoculated are the the Mennonites. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3961.0s)]
*  You know, some of these guys got their golf handicap way down during the so-called time where they're supposed to be working at home. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3971.0s)]
*  You know, they weren't working at home. Who the hell would work at home? How do you work at home? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3980.0s)]
*  Terrible. And we you know, we found a lot of them where they had second jobs or just taking us for a ride. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3985.0s)]
*  They're all taking us for a ride. The foreign countries were really taking us for a ride, both on military and on trade. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3991.0s)]
*  But we stopped it and we're stopping it. I withdrew from the unfair and ridiculous Paris Climate Accord, where we were paying trillions of dollars. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=3996.0s)]
*  We would have spent numbers like you wouldn't believe. And China wouldn't have spent anything. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4006.0s)]
*  Russia wouldn't have spent anything. India wouldn't have spent. But we would have spent over a trillion dollars. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4011.0s)]
*  I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization where where we were paying four hundred and seventy million dollars. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4016.0s)]
*  And China was paying with a population quite a bit larger than ours. Thank you. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4027.0s)]
*  Where let's problem with us, we have no idea what size our population. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4032.0s)]
*  They allowed so many people on under Biden. But let's assume it's three hundred and twenty five million. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4036.0s)]
*  China's one point four billion. We were paying four hundred and seventy million dollars. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4041.0s)]
*  And China was paying thirty nine million dollars. And China was running the whole show. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4046.0s)]
*  So I said, no, thank you. I withdrew. They offered me to sign up at thirty nine million. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4051.0s)]
*  I still said no, because it was sort of scammy. I didn't like it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4057.0s)]
*  And Biden came back in and he signed up and they knew we could have signed up for thirty nine million or less. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4062.0s)]
*  He came back in and he signed up for the same as what they were paying before, almost five hundred million dollars. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4071.0s)]
*  Now, that's a lot of money, but it's nothing compared to the trillions of dollars that they waste. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4078.0s)]
*  But that's the way it is. They know they can sign up for less. They don't even care. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4082.0s)]
*  It's like they don't want to have the conversation. And you're talking about a four hundred and fifty million dollar difference. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4086.0s)]
*  But they came up right in the first week. He said, no, no, we're going right back in. OK, I can understand that. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4092.0s)]
*  But you could make a deal for thirty nine million. They signed up for four hundred and seventy two million dollars. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4099.0s)]
*  And I withdrew from the Anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council, which is totally disgusting. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4106.0s)]
*  The Anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council. In three months, my administration has brought home forty six American hostages and citizens detained abroad. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4113.0s)]
*  Dude, also, we paid nothing. Look, look, we don't pay. He's still on campaign trail. We don't pay. You know, if you pay, I'd rather Trump than the array of authorities that govern the EU or Canada. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4122.0s)]
*  Now, we back boys. My emperor. Six billion. Six billion. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4132.0s)]
*  China, China, 50 seconds. Three times they brought back three hostages. Oh, how is it? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4139.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's a fair deal. What do we pay? Six billion dollars for three people. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4144.0s)]
*  Low, Dutch, you are actually correct. Thank you, Chatter. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4149.0s)]
*  It's not right. I mean, it's just not right. They have no idea. Honestly, they're fucking they're loving it, dude. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4154.0s)]
*  Stupid people. The Asmongoldians are loving this rhetoric. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4160.0s)]
*  More back in just a matter of weeks than Biden brought home in years. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4165.0s)]
*  And he paid a fortune and we paid nothing. We got Mexico to turn over twenty nine of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4170.0s)]
*  And we're charging Mexico and Canada and China big tariffs because of the fact that they've allowed fentanyl to come in and poison our country. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4183.0s)]
*  They're paying a lot of money for that. And because of that, you'll watch. It's going to stop. It's already slowing down. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4194.0s)]
*  Within six weeks, we also apprehended the terrorists responsible for the attack that killed 13 American service members known as Abbey Gate. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4200.0s)]
*  I got to know them. I got to know those families very well. They're devastated during the disasters withdrawal from Afghanistan and brought him home. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4209.0s)]
*  I mean, we brought this guy home to America. We got the guy that did it. We got him. They were looking for years, but we got him. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4219.0s)]
*  It took us to get him. We got him on the in the first month. Brought him home to face justice. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4226.0s)]
*  And it was that gross incompetence that probably led Putin to go in and attack Ukraine because they were never going to. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4236.0s)]
*  That was never going to happen. If I were president, the Ukraine Russia war would have never, ever happened. Not even a little chance. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4243.0s)]
*  We have ended the weaponization of law. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4248.0s)]
*  Wait, Asmongoldians are not Americans. They're probably people happy to see America go to shit. That's such a funny. That's such a funny alternative reality. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4251.0s)]
*  I understand why you would imagine that because you're like, there is no way that Americans are looking at this guy dismantling everything. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4259.0s)]
*  Like the, the last crumb of what America stands for, right? In theory, one might add they've never actually stood for those values that and still be American. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4266.0s)]
*  And you're entertaining the theory that they're like, what secretly Chinese and they're like Trump, the great nation builder for China. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4278.0s)]
*  No, that's not the case. These are people who are incredibly sad individuals who have absolutely nothing going on in their lives. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4286.0s)]
*  Okay. They have, whether they're in America or in Europe, doesn't matter. These are that are united on that principle that their life is pain. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4296.0s)]
*  Existence is a struggle. Everything fucking sucks. So now Trump is fucking it up for everybody else. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4307.0s)]
*  It's even funnier to be in Europe and be a Trump dick rider because he's fucking over Europe way harder than anybody else. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4314.0s)]
*  The idea that like Trump is actually going to be great and beneficial for Europe is the funniest one. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4322.0s)]
*  He is awful for America, but he is even worse for Europe. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4327.0s)]
*  This is of advertising in the history of the world. Mike Lindell. There has never been a better purchaser. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4332.0s)]
*  He comes from Minnesota. No, congratulations. He's the greatest purchaser of ads in history. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4340.0s)]
*  If he would have bought my ads, I could add 10 times more ads on. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4346.0s)]
*  There's never been. Is there any station that doesn't have a pillow added? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4350.0s)]
*  But he's great and he's doing great and he's got a beautiful new wife and all that stuff. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4355.0s)]
*  And I'm proud of you. Look at him holding hands. They're still holding it. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4359.0s)]
*  I'm very proud of this. Nice. Usually by this time, usually in a lot of people I know, Mike, by this time it's over. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4362.0s)]
*  It's over. Look at you holding hands. I love that. I saw that. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4371.0s)]
*  I pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been grossly mistreated. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4375.0s)]
*  We created a brand new DOJ task force on anti-Christian bias. It's a big problem. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4380.0s)]
*  Yeah. Wait, let's see what they say. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4387.0s)]
*  I stripped the security clearances of the disgraced intelligence agents who lied about Hunter Biden's laptop from hell. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4389.0s)]
*  Remember the laptop from hell? Why are they saying the laptop from hell? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4397.0s)]
*  Are they watching right side broadcasting? Is that what it is? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4402.0s)]
*  When you had the 51 agents, they said, oh, Russia did it. Russia. Russia did it. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4404.0s)]
*  I want to see what they have to say about the Christian bias. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4409.0s)]
*  And it was all like horrible, disgusting stuff. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4412.0s)]
*  The 1488 pillow, wide sus. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4415.0s)]
*  By the way, a very brilliant reporter for the New York Post wrote a book called The Laptops. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4418.0s)]
*  Good pillows. I got one as well. Oh my God. Asmongold fans have bought Michael Pillow pillows. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4423.0s)]
*  It tells you the facts. Mr. Vine, the great Mr. Vine. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4428.0s)]
*  She wrote an amazing book, actually, The Laptop from Hell. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4434.0s)]
*  We also terminated the clearances of the Biden. My pillows are a great investment. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4437.0s)]
*  I bought one. It's dog shit. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4442.0s)]
*  And I banned all government censorship and restored free speech in America. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4445.0s)]
*  We have free speech. We didn't have. They totally glanced over. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4451.0s)]
*  I wanted to hear what they had to say about the whole anti-Christian bias thing. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4454.0s)]
*  I thought that maybe they would think it's based all across the entire federal government and the private sector. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4459.0s)]
*  And I made it the official policy of the United States. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4466.0s)]
*  There's nothing funnier than fucking owning yourself by purchasing a Michael Pillow pillow from the Michael Pillow factory for the suspicious price of $14.88, by the way, just to own the libtards. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4469.0s)]
*  You know, you're just not going to have a comfortable night's sleep ever again. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4483.0s)]
*  Speaking of Christian bias scoop, the anti-Semitism awareness act up for vote in the Senate committee tomorrow now has a religious liberty clause to protect Jews killed Jesus statements by Christian conservatives. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4487.0s)]
*  New added language in the bill clarifies First Amendment protections. Oh, that's awesome. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4497.0s)]
*  That's great. All these mutilations. Thank God they made a carve out for Christian nationalists to be anti-Semitic. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4502.0s)]
*  Like they literally, they literally were like, yeah, we're combating anti-Semitism. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4511.0s)]
*  Unless if you're a Christian and you want to say Jews are the ones who killed Jesus and, and, and, you know, and push for that. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4516.0s)]
*  If any American Jew refuses their God given duty to join the Israeli military and new religious liberty clause in the anti-Semitism awareness act allows for a Christian good Samaritan to intervene and beat them to death. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4524.0s)]
*  Wait, what? Okay. Stop. This is a joke chatters. You're being fucking crazy. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4534.0s)]
*  New religious liberty clause in the anti-Semitism awareness act allows for homeschool homeschooling curriculums to include waddo new religious liberty clause in the anti-Semitism awareness act allows for any Christian to take charge of any Jewish cedar. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4539.0s)]
*  If the cedar gets a little weird. Thank you, Mr. President for keeping us money. Grubbing Christ killers safe. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4551.0s)]
*  But that's awesome. Yeah. We're Hey, the anti-Semitism, the anti-Semitism awareness act will now allow, will now allow Christians to do one anti-Semitic hate crime per quarter. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4559.0s)]
*  Okay. We've we've made tremendous compromise. Don't you want these fucking filthy Arabs to stop saying free Palestine? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4574.0s)]
*  Okay. Well then you're going to have to allow some Christian hate crimes. Okay. It's that simple. You know, one swastika to a synagogue per quarter for every Christian just so we can entertain the notion of mass deportations against people, Jews, Christians and Muslims alike that say free Palestine. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4584.0s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Thank God. Thank God. Thank God. I am a Christian nationalist and I was really, I was really worried that I can't talk about how Jews are Christ killers freedom of speech restored art of the deal. Art of the deal. You can't make it up. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4606.0s)]
*  I also signed an order to require proof of citizenship to vote in American elections. That was easy. And the Democrats fought me in that. Think of it. Why would they want no voter ID? Because they want to cheat. Why would they want to have no proof of citizenship? We don't want it. We trust everybody. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4626.0s)]
*  No, they want to cheat. That's all they want to do. Think of that. No voter ID in Michigan. You must never allow rank choice voting to be here. Never. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4655.0s)]
*  We've done this all in 14 weeks. That's one. Remember that 100 days. We've done all of the things that I named and a lot more. And we're counting and what's going to be getting. It's going to be better. Wait. You see the results of some of the things that we're doing in the coming days. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4667.0s)]
*  In the coming weeks and months, we will pass the largest tax cuts in American history, and that will include no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4684.0s)]
*  It's called the one big, beautiful bill, and it will be the biggest bill ever passed in our country's history. It will include the biggest tax cuts, regulation cuts, military supremacy and just about everything else. We will cut more than $1 trillion in wasteful and unnecessary spending. And in the next fiscal year, it'll all be done. We're going to have something that you won't even believe we will end inflation slash prices. We've already ended inflation, raise wages. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4695.0s)]
*  And give you the greatest economy in the history of the world. That's already X Bill. The average family's take home pay will be at least $5000 more than it was just a couple of months ago. We will always protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors with no cuts. And we will defend Medicaid for those great people that are in need. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4725.0s)]
*  House Republicans are working to invest more money in Medicaid than we spent today. The only thing we're going to cut is the corruption and the crooks that take advantage of some of the illegal scheme. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4749.0s)]
*  So we want to preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable for our kids, pregnant women, the poor and disabled Americans. We will fully and permanently secure our border. We will make the largest ever investment in U.S. military and build the Golden Dome Missile Defense Shield. That's going to all protect us. So we live a long and beautiful life. It's going to be made in Michigan and it's going to be made right here in the USA. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4762.0s)]
*  And one hour ago, I just made a speech at Selfridge Air Force Air National Guard Base announcing that we are saving it, keeping it open, including thousands of jobs with a brand new state of the art F-15s, which are coming to South Korea. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4787.0s)]
*  And we will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect they so dearly deserve. I will defend religious liberty and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms. We will celebrate the 250th anniversary of America's founding in 2026. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4804.0s)]
*  And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And one day soon, American astronauts will plant the flag on the planet Mars. That's going to happen very soon. Every single day of my administration. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4829.0s)]
*  Okay, bro. Sure. You to live by the motto. They made a carve out for an actually kind of anti-Semitic statement in the bill that considers wide opposition to Israel policy to be anti-Semitic to Midland as precisely what's going on here. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4847.0s)]
*  Because Marjorie Taylor green and then chirped at the admin for saying like you're going too far because we do want to say Jews are Christ killers, which is, you know, a big part of the whole pogroms and, and, and the anti-Jewish resentment that Christians have held on to for centuries at this point. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4860.0s)]
*  So that's like, that's probably the most like that's the most anti-Semitic inception point for, for all historic anti-Jewish pogroms and, and, and the like, actually incorrect since he didn't die in Islam. He's alive in heaven. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4886.0s)]
*  All right, Hassan, you were right. This is very medieval. Yeah. Only, only an incredible admin administration like this one would be able to find such a unique carve out where their anti-Semitism bill is like, if you say anything about Israel, we will fucking kill you. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4906.0s)]
*  Unless you're a Christian nationalist and you call Jews Christ killers, in which case that's a okay. Fantastic. It's fucking insane, dude. It is so, it is so repugnant is so in full display that has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. How can the ADL possibly defend that? I want to see what they write about it. I don't fucking know. They'll probably be like, Oh, Mr. President, sir, this is unacceptable. Why are you doing this? We really love you, but please don't do this. Anyway, that in the U.S. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4922.0s)]
*  Usury thing, Jews are able to loan money during the black plague without it being a sin. So we should hit the fan in Europe. There were citywide pogroms. Oh yeah. The David Hogg. Well, the DNC is going through it. How long until Trump starts deporting American Jews to Israel? I don't want to go to Israel, please. No, it's going to, it's going to be awesome. You're going to the desert. Okay. And it's actually for your own good. You simply don't understand. That's like, that's, that's inevitably, that's the final breaking point of this project is like, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4952.0s)]
*  because we love Israel so much and because we love Zionism so much that American Jews have to complete the Zionist project, which is a twofer because the American evangelical Christian base loves that. Not only are they anti-Semitic and don't want to be around Jews anyway, but it also works within their, their, their end time theology. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=4982.0s)]
*  Like it works within their end times, a theological structure where, you know, the rapture is going to happen. It's a, it's a perfect final solution. It wasn't the Madagascar plan. It was, Oh my God. What is he doing? Oh, Aryan. That is somehow zestier than the previous variance. Oh my God. He was so sexy. Oh fuck. He was so hot. We got to run it back. God damn it. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He's so hot. He [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5005.52s)]
*  is so fucking sexy, dude. Fuck. I'm so turned on right now. Oh my fucking God. Oh my Trump. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5035.52s)]
*  Oh my Trump. Cause Trump is my God. That was so fucking hot, dude. Liv Tars don't want [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5046.64s)]
*  you to know. Liv Tars don't want to admit that nutting at my president doing a gay dance [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5054.9800000000005s)]
*  is actually the highest stage of masculinity and also being heterosexual. Okay. All of [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5060.96s)]
*  you, all of you live Tars are too afraid to look at the sexiest president that has ever [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5068.84s)]

*  straightest dance ever. Oh, he's my king. He is my goat. He's doing homo fascism. Oh, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5117.04s)]
*  he's so hot. He's so sexy. I'm some. And by that, I mean, by that, I mean, I'm the straightest [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5133.76s)]
*  man alive because wanting to, wanting to suck and fuck this man is the highest stage of [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5140.12s)]
*  heterosexuality. Oh, that's amazing. Wow. Wow. I always thought the double dick suck was [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5145.92s)]
*  one thing, you know, that was excellent, but I didn't realize that he had a double dick [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5154.12s)]
*  twirl. The bill essentially just says, I can say whatever I want based upon my religion, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5157.6s)]
*  just to clarify, by the way, we still love you though. Yeah, that's, that's the, that's [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5161.8s)]

*  let's get to, we briefly covered the silliness from [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeSvMdaRD0&t=5171.92s)]
