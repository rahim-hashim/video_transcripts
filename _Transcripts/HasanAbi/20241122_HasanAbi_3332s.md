# Mythology And Evolution: Are Dragons Real? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ)
*  Wait, this clip is literally from 2019. I was going to say Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan talking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  about like whether or not dragons are real or not. Doesn't seem like new Joe Rogan. It [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=8.34s)]
*  seems like good Joe Rogan, old Joe Rogan, which is why I was a little confused. And [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=13.66s)]
*  when you scroll down, you realize, Oh no, this is like, it's not the best Joe Rogan [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=19.78s)]
*  is like 2016 era. I think before Milo, Milo Yiannopoulos, we went from water. Joe Rogan [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=25.46s)]
*  his back after criticism from the view dragon believer. Okay. Let's get to some real news. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=36.18s)]
*  Jesus Christ. No wonder people don't want to watch liberal media, man. This just sucks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=40.5s)]
*  I mean, everything, everything sucks for the most part. And, and the coverage is, is not [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=45.14s)]
*  great. Okay. Elon and Trump are definitely doing it together. You think they're having [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=52.06s)]
*  basically to this guy, Joe Rogan, who believes in dragons. He, I checked it. He believes in drag. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=56.38s)]
*  He believes in dragons. Yes, I did. And he also thinks that they dragons, like, I guess, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=63.54s)]
*  like dinosaur type type of animals roam the earth when people did. Rogan really leaning into this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=69.38s)]
*  one by changing his bio to quote dragon believer. Joe Concha is a Fox news contributor and he [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  joins us now. So this is so up Joe Rogan's alley in terms of what he finds funny to first of all, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=80.98s)]
*  be called a dragon believer and also to be accused of being an unreliable source of information by [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=86.98s)]
*  the ladies of the view. So what is your reaction to all of this? Oh yes, Carly, we should absolutely [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=93.18s)]
*  trust the view and not the guy. I mean, okay. You guys want to understand some, this is the reason [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=98.58000000000001s)]
*  why Fox news ratings are infinitely better than the liberal media ratings. Okay. Here's why. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  Because they're both talking about nonsense. Okay. But at least this is entertaining nonsense. Do you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=111.14s)]
*  see what I mean? The nonsense that we just watched on CNN is like the, the minor differences between [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=118.34s)]
*  Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk and how we should take these guys seriously and how they're going to, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=125.18s)]
*  how they're going to, I don't know, possibly improve the federal government or maybe ruin it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=132.1s)]
*  Whereas these guys are just like Joe Rogan. Look at these dumb asses who say Joe Rogan believes in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=138.26s)]
*  dragons. He only believes in dragons a little bit guy who revolutionized the world with electric [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  cars, SpaceX. I could go on with the, the accomplishments of, of Elon Musk. I have a question. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=148.5s)]
*  Do people get to a point in life where they realize that they're, you know, because this is what panic [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  sounds like in legacy media. I've said this before in this program, it's worth repeating again. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  Because it's so disturbing. The view is under the ABC News umbrella. ABC News is run by a woman named [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=168.1s)]
*  Dana Walden. Dana Walden is Kamala Harris's very best friend. They lived right near each other in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  Brentwood, California when she was a Senator there. Dana Walden set up Kamala Harris on a blind date [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=183.22s)]
*  with Doug Emhoff, who she obviously is now married to. And now this is what the result is of Dana [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=189.3s)]
*  Walden running ABC News. You have people like Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg under the ABC News umbrella, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=196.18s)]
*  losing their mind. I need to know, I need to actually dive deeper into this Joe Rogan dragon [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=203.46s)]
*  shit. We're in hell. We might as well enjoy it. Does anybody have the clip? Where did this Joe [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  Rogan dragon stuff come from? Where is it coming from? Yahoo.com is the only article that's readily [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=213.22s)]
*  available for this important piece of news. Joe Rogan ups the Annie with his view feud with evidence [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  that dragons existed. That's not a sentence that makes much of Joe Rogan is doubling down on his. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=224.58s)]
*  Okay. This is from his podcast. Okay. Let's start. Let's start here first. So were dragons real [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  animals? You, you like these kind of far out there ideas. How do you like this idea? There's a cut. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=235.3s)]
*  There's a group of people that say that dragons were real and I'll explain. So around the same [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=240.74s)]
*  time period, so to speak, and I'm not one of these people, so I'm probably going to get the details [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=248.34s)]
*  wrong a little bit. Yeah, seriously. But, uh, so around the same time period in, you know, China, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=251.62s)]
*  I think he's trolling, right? Evidence dragons were real full documentary. Like I don't think [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=258.02s)]
*  he actually thinks dragons are real. Yeah. South America, Africa, all these different Rome, all [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=262.5s)]
*  these places, images depicted people fighting dragons, right? And every, every dragon was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=268.26s)]
*  slightly different, but it was all a giant scaly animal that could fly. So when you take, when you [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=273.06s)]
*  break that down, you think about the fact that large birds had a hard time being fossilized [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=278.82s)]
*  because their bones are so porous, right? So because bones, they have like hollowish bones, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=282.98s)]
*  they break down very easily and they don't fossilize. Wait, this clip is literally from [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=287.62s)]
*  2019. I was going to say Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan talking about like, whether or not dragons are [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=293.06s)]
*  real or not doesn't seem like new Joe Rogan. It seems like good Joe Rogan, old Joe Rogan, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=300.98s)]
*  which is why I was a little confused. And when you scroll down, you realize, oh no, this is like, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  it's not the best Joe Rogan. Cause the best Joe Rogan is like 2016 era. I think before my [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=312.82s)]
*  Milo Yiannopoulos pre Milo Joe Rogan pre like white supremacists are always going to be able to, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  you know, premises always have a, a, an opportunity to come and speak to millions of people on my [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=325.46s)]
*  podcast, Joe Rogan. But this is definitely a, an older version of Joe Rogan that was still [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=331.46s)]
*  kind of, you know, that was still kind of fun. So the, the, the group that says this, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  basically they're, they're saying the evidence is the reason there's no fossils of dragons is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=344.9s)]
*  because they had bird bones and they were actually very delicate animals, but a handful of these [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=349.06s)]
*  small, a small population of these giant lip flying lizards existed and basically [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=354.26s)]
*  encompassed all these different countries where they all depicted fighting dragons in their own [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=360.82s)]
*  way. And they were all killed off by, you know, nights or whatever it is. And then, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=365.14s)]
*  the person who's describing to him the, the dragon stuff is also not a believer or a committed [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=370.73999999999995s)]
*  believer to the dragon theory. What is this? Do you think he'll ever acknowledge you? How hard [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  would you have to insult him? No, Joe Rogan will never acknowledge me because I have insulted him [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=381.94s)]
*  far too much. But, but I think this is like the, this is, this is the exact type of conversation [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=387.14s)]
*  Joe Rogan used to have that wasn't like damaging or dangerous at all. It was just like fun [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=393.94s)]
*  conspiracies that, that we all like to entertain. Okay. Every now and then I've done it too. I've [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=399.46s)]
*  done the mud fossil university shit. I've like sarcastically aligned myself with this, with this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=408.34s)]
*  notion. If you recall, like this isn't, I think this type of shit is fun and totally acceptable. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=414.73999999999995s)]
*  Like, Oh yeah, maybe dragons were real versus there's a cabal of Jews that control the media [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=422.97999999999996s)]
*  and are also simultaneously, you know, beaming pornography into your brains and also doing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=430.58s)]
*  unlimited amounts of third world immigration into the country. Okay. Like that is not so fun. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=437.14s)]
*  That type of conspiratorial thinking is fascist and not good. And I feel like, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=445.46s)]
*  I feel like we moved on from the ha ha funny, cute, who knows, maybe dragons did exist. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=451.46s)]
*  Imagine a world where they did type of conspiracy theories to the second type. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=459.53999999999996s)]
*  Didn't fossilize. So it's like the science is saying that if there were lizards big enough to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=465.7s)]
*  fly around and eat people, they didn't have bones that could fossilize. So it'd be like an eagle. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  Right. And so, and that's why, you know, that's why all these human populations around the world [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=475.46s)]
*  have depictions of them because they did actually exist. Now, are there any stories of dragons like [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=481.3s)]
*  written, like in the times of people that they have actually had the written word or is it just [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=486.98s)]
*  depictions? I don't know. Not my field. That would be interesting because like, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=491.38s)]
*  are these depictions like ancient accounts told by generation after generation passed down? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=494.98s)]
*  So I think, I don't know. I don't know anything about dragons or whether it's real, but I think [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=501.78s)]
*  it's interesting to think, oh, well, the science supports that if there were flying lizards, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=505.94s)]
*  their bones wouldn't have fossilized. And these have been passed down stories. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=510.26s)]
*  And so what about like pterodactyls? Like what, how the do they exist then? What they did, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=513.78s)]
*  there were flying. Wait, why is that different? Those are flying reptiles, bro. He just said [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=520.34s)]
*  flying lizards. How is that any different? I mean, he's not even arguing for this. He's not [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  arguing for this position. He very clearly said he doesn't believe this, but he thinks it's like a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=530.1800000000001s)]
*  fun, cool conspiracy. Also what's hilarious about this is like the current existing birds are the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  closest, I think genetically to dinosaurs. So I don't really understand where we're going with [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=541.38s)]
*  that one. You're out of your depth on this bro. Yeah. Really Peterson clip Dawkins on the biological. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=548.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. So Alex O'Connor, I saw a bunch of clips from this and well, first of all, this is a, let [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=554.9000000000001s)]
*  them fight situation. Cause I don't like Richard Dawkins and I definitely, I like Jordan Peterson [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=560.98s)]
*  even less, but on this issue, like I am offering critical support to Richard Dawkins, even though [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=566.1s)]
*  he is the most annoying type of like r slash Reddit atheist who has even in recent years said [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=572.1800000000001s)]
*  he's culturally Christian. Okay. Cook not going to lie. Joy Behar says Joe Rogan believes in [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=577.7s)]
*  dragons and that's why he's not reliable. Whereas the view is very reliable. They thought Biden was [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=583.5400000000001s)]
*  young and dynamic had no problems. Okay. He did cook. I mean, he did cook on this. He's absolutely [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=587.3000000000001s)]
*  correct on this. Dinosaurs are also reptiles. Oz and I be pro terran and dons are another kind of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=591.7800000000001s)]
*  reptile, completely different from dinosaurs and not dinos. I'm an unemployed paleontologist. Please. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=596.9000000000001s)]
*  This is the only thing I'm good for. This is semantics, but birds aren't just the closest [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=602.0200000000001s)]
*  thing to dinosaurs. We have, they literally are dinosaurs. They're the dinosaurs that survived. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=605.7s)]
*  Yeah. That's what I thought too. The Adam King show. Why couldn't you speak prior to the election [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=609.1400000000001s)]
*  results? Why now do you defend what you clearly felt for a long time? This right here is the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=613.46s)]
*  perfect demonstration of how right-wing mania works by the way, shaky Gerga chunk Weigert. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=617.7800000000001s)]
*  Okay. My uncle was a very prominent critic of Joe Biden. Okay. Myself and jank and many other [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=624.4200000000001s)]
*  commentators on the, on the leftist sphere to the liberal sphere routinely yelled about Joe Biden [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=634.66s)]
*  being 800 years old, but this guy is fantasizing about a position that jank never actually held. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=642.74s)]
*  Now all evidence points to the exact contrary of this. And yet that hasn't stopped 700 people [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=650.9s)]
*  from liking this because nobody cares about the truth. He literally ran for office. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=655.54s)]
*  So that he could get others to realize that Joe Biden is too old and maybe give them the courage [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=665.2199999999999s)]
*  to run within the democratic party, knowing full well that it was a, you know, constitutional battle [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=672.02s)]
*  that he would not win anyway, cause he's not born in the United States. I said, Biden was too old. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=677.9399999999999s)]
*  I started petition to get him out of the race 14 months ago and even ran against him in the primer. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=682.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I did all I could. Yeah. And that's what's crazy. These people do not care. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=685.86s)]
*  Like people are doubling down. What primary are we pretending we had one now? This might be the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=691.14s)]
*  biggest one I've ever seen for those in election cope. Wait, everyone's favorite Hebrew Jew haters [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=697.14s)]
*  beware found it. Infowars band.video DM for media inquiries. This guy's an info wars guy. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=703.22s)]
*  I hate this shit, man. I hate it so much. People are legitimately, people are just like arguing [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=709.78s)]
*  against the truth and they don't give a fuck. Narrative is significantly more important than [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=718.02s)]
*  the truth. Okay. The dragon fight too. Have you overcome in your life? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=723.54s)]
*  I'm not interested in dragons. I'm interested in reality. Okay. So I read a book a while back [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=728.98s)]
*  that described the biological reality of the drag and say, well, there's no such thing as a dragon. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=733.46s)]
*  It's like, okay, is there such a thing as a predator? Of course. Well, that's a meta category. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=738.9s)]
*  What's the category of predator bear, eagle? If you're a primate, fire is fire predator. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=744.34s)]
*  Well, it's complicated because a fire kills you. So is there a worse predator than serpentine flying [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=750.9s)]
*  fire breathing reptile? Is that not the imagistic equivalent of predator? If predator is real, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=758.1s)]
*  in what way isn't dragon real? So a dragon is a pictorial representation of the abstracted [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=764.02s)]
*  concept of a predator. Yes. But when you say the bio... [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=768.74s)]
*  Dude, this is such a funny, I'm sorry. God, the debate space is such a fucking joke, dude. It's [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=771.94s)]
*  like, this is, this reads as a parody and they are not parodying like the worst aspects of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=778.1800000000001s)]
*  fucking debate culture. They are on ironically engaging in this like hyper intellectualized, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=785.78s)]
*  very sincere argument about whether or not Jordan Peterson literally believes dragons exist [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=792.42s)]
*  or if he's actually simply saying that the dragon is a representation of the apex predator. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=798.5s)]
*  Like, I just don't, like, how do you, how can you sit down with Jordan Peterson and have a sincere [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=807.6999999999999s)]
*  conversation like this? It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't... The biology of a dragon. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=812.5s)]
*  You must understand how that can be misleading. I don't think the category of dragon is any less [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=816.8199999999999s)]
*  valid than the category of lion. Any less biological? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=821.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, it depends on your level of analysis. I'm embarrassed to admit that I watched all of this [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=825.22s)]
*  and it's pretty much all the way through. Yeah. No, I saw clips of this and I thought it was really [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=829.62s)]
*  funny. I derive entertainment from this conversation that Alex Cooper presented. Okay. But not in a way [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=833.3s)]
*  not in, not in the way that other people, I think understood it. Okay. Oh, this is a direct combo [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=841.62s)]
*  that he had with Jordan B Peterson. Hold on. Yahweh is acting like a tribal war. God, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=847.06s)]
*  God is a delusion. Oxford union speech. Ben Shapiro versus Alex O'Connor is religion good for society [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=852.58s)]
*  debate theism versus Oh God. This shit pops off by the way. This, this shit bangs on TikTok. I think [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=858.9s)]
*  and it certainly bangs on fucking YouTube as well. I don't know. It just, it is so, it is so outside [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=867.3s)]
*  of my, my field of interest. I don't know how else to describe it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=874.98s)]
*  What is this? That's your problem. Dawkins versus Peterson. Okay. Here, let's ask you before about [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=881.62s)]
*  the difference between a story or an idea naturally evolving over the course of numerous [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=892.02s)]
*  manuscripts and throughout human history and the idea of it being divinely inspired. And you've [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=897.3s)]
*  never had a teenage existential crisis. You know, this shit goes hard if you're stupid. I think this [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=901.46s)]
*  is like one step above like truly stupid guys. Okay. I think like, this is a stupid guy who's [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=905.7s)]
*  at least on a journey to not be as stupid, but thinks instead of reading books, you watch this [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=912.4200000000001s)]
*  video and you, your takeaway is that you're smarter for it. If that makes sense, Alex O'Connor and [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=918.6600000000001s)]
*  Hassan, I was not a crossover. I expected I should reach out to him when I'm in, when I'm in Oxford, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=925.1400000000001s)]
*  when I'm in London, when I'm in England, if he's out there, I don't know. And do a sit down. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=932.34s)]
*  Alex O'Connor is a smart man. I'm biased cause I'm a Brit too, but he's all we have in the space. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=938.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't hate him. I think he is, I mean, there's definitely, there's definitely a lot more, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=942.98s)]
*  you know, there's, I have a, I have a long list of British people that I admire [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=949.7s)]
*  before we get to someone like him. I don't know the full scope of his commentary, but having said [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=954.5s)]
*  that he is, he does give off and maybe I'm totally off base with this, but he does give [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=961.06s)]
*  off our slash atheism vibes. Like my opinion on my opinion on religion is, is pretty well known [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=966.42s)]
*  at this point. I hope that you guys understand it. It's just like live and let live. People believe [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=973.6199999999999s)]
*  a whole bunch of hokum that I don't believe in. And I don't fault them for it. As long as it's [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=978.18s)]
*  like offering some level of fucking guidance in their lives. But most importantly, as long as they [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=983.78s)]
*  don't use that to, to manipulate other people's existence and use that to harm other people. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=989.54s)]
*  That's it. Does that make sense? Like, I don't care. I'm not invested in like trying to atheist [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=996.5799999999999s)]
*  pill you at all. Does that make sense? Pretty sure his education is in theology. I think he's, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1003.9399999999999s)]
*  isn't he philosophy? He's a philosophy nerd, isn't he? He isn't, he is nuanced on the theism. Now he [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1008.42s)]
*  studied theology. I thought he was a philosophy guy. Why are you going to Oxford, England? Why [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1013.86s)]
*  are you going to Oxford? Don't worry about it. He has degrees in philosophy and theology. Oh, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1018.02s)]
*  okay. That makes sense. Did you ever get a massage from a man? Fuck yeah. I need powerful, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1022.1s)]
*  powerful hands to rub this body up and down. And you were seeming to imply that these are [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1026.9s)]
*  almost interchangeable. Isn't the problem that people dismiss science because of religion? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1034.18s)]
*  Isn't this the biggest issue we have? So many people ignoring reality like climate change. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1037.46s)]
*  I mean, I think that that reactionary tendency doesn't specifically come from, doesn't exclusively [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1040.98s)]
*  come from religion. There are plenty of non-religious people that also are climate [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1046.58s)]
*  deniers, climate change deniers, like hyper focusing on, hyper focusing on religion. I think in this, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1051.54s)]
*  in this instance is just like, yeah. Concepts. Now, if that's the case, when you say that this, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1059.86s)]
*  this divine spirit behind the Bible is actually just the way that it has evolved throughout the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1066.6599999999999s)]
*  human history, throughout the different manuscripts that we've had, then saying that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1072.66s)]
*  that is what divinity is, I think for you may drag the mundane up into the realm of divinity. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1076.18s)]
*  But I think for people like Richard and for many people listening, what it does instead is drags [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1082.66s)]
*  the divine down to the realm of the mundane. Very well put. Yes. Well, I don't know why it would [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1086.3400000000001s)]
*  drag the divine down into the realm of the mundane if we're speaking of something like a, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1091.78s)]
*  the straight narrow path of harmony between multiple, multiple modes of being. I don't think [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1098.5s)]
*  it doesn't make any difference to me whether it's the material reaching upward or the divine [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1105.6200000000001s)]
*  descending downward. I don't think there's any difference between those two things. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1109.54s)]
*  That's exactly right. That's the problem. Like this is nerd on nerd violence, dude. This is nerd on [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1112.66s)]
*  nerd violence. This is a crime. Okay. I'm all in favor of shitting on Jordan Peterson though. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1120.02s)]
*  Well, look at it this way. So for example, in this conversation, you know this to be the case, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1128.34s)]
*  like there's various ways that this conversation could go sideways, right? Seriously. Like we could, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1133.6999999999998s)]
*  either of us could try to win. Either of us could try to demonstrate our intellectual superiority, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1140.6599999999999s)]
*  right? Each of us could misrepresent the other. Or we could both try. And I do think we are in fact [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1145.86s)]
*  trying that. And I think Alex is helping. Hopefully they united on their hatred for [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1152.98s)]
*  Islam-olef-tism at the end of this process. You know what I mean? Real bipartisanship and [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1158.5s)]
*  compromise was found on this day. I hope, I hope. Along with that, just, just fine. We could try to [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1163.46s)]
*  follow the thread of the exploratory truth and see if we could get somewhere. Now I don't think [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1170.42s)]
*  there is any difference between that, by the way, and what's expressed in the biblical texts as the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1175.5400000000002s)]
*  spirit of the logos. That's why we have dialogue. I'm very interested in the possibility that [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1180.42s)]
*  truths emerge through evolving manuscripts. Now that's a very interesting idea. And it's totally [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1187.3000000000002s)]
*  different from divine inspiration. And I want to pursue it because I don't believe in divine [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1194.1000000000001s)]
*  inspiration, but I would be prepared to believe in evolving manuscripts. Well, I would say, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1199.3000000000002s)]
*  yes, the big issue is when atheists misattribute all of the world's problems, the religion is an [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1205.54s)]
*  idealist view. When the materialist worldview, religion is a simple tool used by both the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1209.3s)]
*  oppressors and the oppressed for various reasons. Exactly. Religion is a tool. And the greatest [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1214.02s)]
*  example of this is Christianity being used to both uplift and defend the white supremacist [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1220.02s)]
*  construct of chattel slavery, and also Christianity being used as a guiding principle in liberation [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1226.6599999999999s)]
*  theology that played a formative role in the abolition of slavery. I just don't like, I like [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1234.18s)]
*  it if it's being used as a galvanizing factor for good causes such as the abolition of slavery. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1241.0600000000002s)]
*  I don't like it when it's used as a reason to uphold unjustifiable constructs that are inhumane [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1247.8600000000001s)]
*  like chattel slavery. That's it. This is my major, I think this is what separates me from all the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1256.18s)]
*  r slash atheism people is that they're like, no, you don't understand, like, it's just religion, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1263.7s)]
*  it's only religion is the religion and also we should actively try to convert religious people [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1268.18s)]
*  to be atheists. Oh, my logic. Oh, my science. Instead of saying God bless you after you sneeze, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1273.94s)]
*  I say science bless you, sir. It may not be a problem in common fornia. As someone in Oklahoma, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1279.54s)]
*  the religion is the problem. Yeah, totally. You're right. This is why I had set forward the [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1284.5800000000002s)]
*  possibility. The irony, of course, I think with people that say, no, it's just religion. That is [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1291.38s)]
*  the problem is that you're doing the same thing that the dumbasses are doing on the other side. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1297.38s)]
*  Okay. Right wing Christians look at that and go, no, religion is the solution. And you hyper focus [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1302.18s)]
*  on religion is not religion. Okay. It's capitalism. One example I can give you is that while the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1308.42s)]
*  underlying material realities have gotten worse in comparison to in comparison to like, you know, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1315.3799999999999s)]
*  where they could be, especially when you look at the wealth disparity in this country and the gap [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1322.5s)]
*  widening religion on the other hand, religiosity in America has gone down. It's actually gone down [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1329.7s)]
*  so consistently. Atheists in spite of their annoying attitude are winning this battle, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1337.14s)]
*  but they're not necessarily winning this battle because they're making convincing arguments. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1345.46s)]
*  Okay. That's cause of Bill Maher's hit movie. Yeah. Atheists and agnostics are winning the battle. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1349.38s)]
*  And I think it's because religion plays a formative role in uncovering certain truths about [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1354.5800000000002s)]
*  nature that science is at this stage, incapable of addressing. And as science ends up [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1360.1799999999998s)]
*  figuring out certain truths to the best of its ability, then there's less space for religion [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1367.86s)]
*  in that process. This is why I think a lot of religious people happen to be anti-science. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1373.3s)]
*  What that has been debunked. What do you mean? Get debunked on. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1380.5s)]
*  Militant atheism is teenage shit. Yeah. I mean, I was, I was definitely made a way more of a R slash [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1384.8200000000002s)]

*  debate my religion teacher in third grade in Turkey on why our religion class wasn't teaching [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1400.26s)]
*  any other religions and only teaching Islam and even going so far as to fail said class, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1408.74s)]
*  because on the test I would draw a mosque rather than answer any of the religion questions. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1414.66s)]
*  That's not, that's how much of a fucking, that's how much of an annoying little shit I was using [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1421.7s)]

*  that's the first thing I remember from my childhood being an angry baby and thinking, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1446.5s)]
*  Ooh, I'll be, I'll be super cool and stand up against my teacher. I think it's also because [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1453.1399999999999s)]

*  Okay. Turkish people, holy shit. I'm chunk of a big chunk of the reason is the why fucking so many [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1464.34s)]
*  people are not, not as religious any longer is because it's because of how fucking annoying [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1470.34s)]
*  people who teach religion are when they're growing up. That's why so many Catholics [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1476.5s)]
*  since birth are just like totally out of the religion. And that's probably why so many adult [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1482.58s)]
*  reverts and adult converts have a deep levels of zealotry and fundamentalism. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1488.58s)]
*  JD Vance, Michael Pence are two that immediately come to mind. That's why it's so funny to see [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1494.82s)]
*  a adult convert of Catholicism. When you're a kid, you're like, this shit's boring as fuck, bro. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1502.82s)]
*  I don't care about this. Like I want to go play basketball outside or some shit. You know what [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1508.82s)]
*  I mean? Why the fuck do I have to sit through this? My time could be best served watching anime, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1513.62s)]
*  please. You know, I just like militant atheists almost as much as the hyper religious. Yeah. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1518.82s)]
*  Militant atheists are so goddamn annoying. I'm sorry. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1522.9799999999998s)]

*  Milletant atheists are, are, are really fucking annoying. And Richard Dawkins is like the perfect [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1558.5s)]
*  reason why I despise militant, a militant atheist, because militant atheists also in [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1564.74s)]
*  their idealistic liberal notion of religion being the end all be all, and the, you know, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1571.7s)]
*  anti-religious movement being the solution to all of society's problems that they foresee [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1578.1000000000001s)]
*  end up reinforcing a shit ton of white supremacist constructs, Islamophobia being the key thing. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1583.38s)]
*  Okay. Dawkins is awesome. He's just saying the truth, not a militant. Am I crazy? Isn't [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1592.5800000000002s)]
*  Dawkins also won a transphobe and to recently admitted that he was culturally Catholic or some [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1597.38s)]
*  shit. He said he was a culturally Christian. Richard Dawkins among many of these, like, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1602.74s)]
*  you know, new, new wave atheist is like a not exactly a good guy. He's a bit of a weirdo. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1608.8200000000002s)]
*  Sam Harris is another one. Biologically, I would say he's not as, he's not as big as a weirdo as [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1614.98s)]
*  this fucking guy. But like I said, there's a lot of stuff that they agree on, including the trains [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1620.5800000000002s)]
*  of thought that led you to the development of the idea of the meme. I really believe that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1627.06s)]
*  analogies is one thing, but, but is it the same thing? I was slightly horrified to hear that [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1631.22s)]
*  Ramadan is being promoted instead. I do think that we, we are culturally a Christian country. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1636.74s)]
*  I hold myself a cultural Christian. I'm not a believer, but there's a distinction between. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1642.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a, I'm a cultural Muslim. Okay. And there's never been a moment where I was like, wow, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1647.94s)]
*  we got to stop with these church bells. You know what I'm saying? Well, what is this? What's up [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1653.1399999999999s)]
*  with this promotion of the fucking church, the inconsistency in and of itself of like saying one [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1656.98s)]
*  type of, one type of religious cultural artifact is actually totally permissible. And the other is [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1663.8600000000001s)]
*  actually wrong and bad. Okay. In my opinion, that end of itself is just another way to reinforce [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1670.5s)]
*  the exact same white supremacist fucking constructs that Jordan Peterson is, is demonstrating. Okay. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1678.26s)]
*  Being a believing Christian and being a cultural Christian. And so, you know, I, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1684.74s)]
*  I love hymns and Christmas carols and I, I sort of feel at home in the Christian ethos. I feel that [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1688.5s)]
*  we are a Christian country in that sense. It's true that statistically the number of people who [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1696.66s)]
*  actually believe in Christianity is going down. And I, I'm happy with that, but I would not. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1703.22s)]
*  Chatter sent me this thinking it's Richard Dawkins dog. This is, I believe his name is Jared Taylor. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1710.4199999999998s)]
*  Okay. Understandable mistake from an anti, from a anti white racist, such as members of this community, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1717.54s)]
*  but this person is an out and about white nationalist. Okay. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1725.9399999999998s)]
*  Be happy if for example, we lost all our cathedrals and our beautiful parish churches. So I, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1732.5s)]
*  count myself a cultural Christian. I think it would matter if we certainly be substituted [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1740.5s)]
*  any alternative religion that would be true, truly dreadful. Which brings me to, to my [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1745.94s)]
*  supplementary point, which is that as we know, church attendance is plummeting, but the building, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1750.26s)]
*  the erection of mosques across Europe, I think 6,000 are under. Wait, is this the guy who says [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1756.42s)]
*  Asians are smarter than whites? No, that's, I think Sam Harris, you're once again, mistaking your white [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1761.7s)]
*  r slash atheist heroes with one another. I believe, I mean, he might've entertained the, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1767.22s)]
*  the scientific racism as well, race realism, but Sam Harris was the one who entertained the, the [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1773.46s)]
*  race realist, like the, the scientific basis for IQ and how it differs from race to race, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1783.6200000000001s)]
*  you know, some, some real biological essentialism. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1791.54s)]
*  Instruction and there are many more, I mean, are being planned. So do you think, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1795.94s)]
*  do you regard that as a problem? Do you think that matters? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1800.74s)]
*  Say what you will about Hitchens' disasters Iraq war takes, but he was based regarding Palestine. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1803.06s)]
*  Yeah. So many of these guys broke their brains after the war on terror. That's what it is. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1807.8600000000001s)]
*  Shadyism, um, r slash atheism guys just straight up had their brains completely broken. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1812.74s)]
*  And not necessarily some of which started under the, the, the George W. Bush admin. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1820.66s)]
*  Okay. But certainly under the Obama administration, or they kept, they, they just became more and more [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1827.94s)]
*  insanely fucking militant against any sort of, any sort of invocation of Islam, any sort of [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1837.3799999999999s)]
*  fucking imagery that depicts Muslims as like human beings. They were fucking, they went crazy over it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1845.3s)]
*  Yes, I do really. I mean, I, I, I, I don't, I choose my words carefully. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1851.6999999999998s)]
*  During Bush, all atheists were basically like hardcore leftist anarchists. Yes and no. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1858.26s)]
*  That's why I always will have respect for Kyle Kalinsky because out of all of those, like, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1862.34s)]
*  I'm a skeptic, I'm a skeptic thinker. I'm an anti-theist. I'm a Reddit atheist type of guys. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1870.82s)]
*  He was the only one that was like, yo, we're really fucking over Muslims a lot. And it's pretty crazy. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1877.6999999999998s)]
*  Whereas, whereas the rest of that community had incredibly reactionary tendencies that, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1883.9399999999998s)]
*  that basically made their hyper-focus Islam and Islamic culture or whatever they understood it [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1892.4199999999998s)]
*  as Islamic culture, no interest in like trying to understand how reactionary fundamentalist [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1900.02s)]
*  sentiment can, can manifest in a region that is like completely fucking dominated with war [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1909.06s)]
*  and destroyed, you know, that's what's so frustrating about it. It's like, dude, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1917.3s)]
*  people, if you bomb them, if you blow them up, if you kill them over and over again, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1922.1s)]
*  yeah, they're going to be fucking angry at you. And they're going to find themselves in the throes [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1925.78s)]
*  of reactionary thinking. And oftentimes that's going to play itself out in, in, you know, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1932.5s)]
*  fundamentalist understandings of religion. I mean, I, if I had to choose between Christianity [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1938.1s)]
*  and Islam, I choose Christianity every single time. I mean, it seems to me to be a fundamentally [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1945.3s)]
*  decent religion in a way that I think Islam is not. I think you're going to have to explain [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1951.7s)]
*  why you say that, Professor Dawkins. Why is Islam profund, fundamentally not decent like Christianity? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1958.02s)]
*  Yes. I mean, the way women are treated, I mean, Christianity is not great about that. It's had its [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1966.5s)]
*  problems with female vicar and female bishops and things, but there's an active hostility to women, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1971.54s)]
*  which is promoted, I think, by the holy books of Islam. I'm not talking about individual Muslim. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1977.62s)]
*  Yeah. Christians on the other hand, infinitely tolerant of women, you know, and, and again, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1983.86s)]
*  all religion is beholden to interpretations. Okay. Nobody fucking, nobody follows religion to a tee [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1989.46s)]
*  and the people who claim to follow it down to the wire are actually fundamentalists. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=1999.46s)]
*  Okay. If you look at religion and then say like, Oh, Muslims are just like inherently anti-women [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2004.58s)]
*  because of their religion, you are refusing to understand, you are refusing to understand [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2010.4199999999998s)]
*  the, the reasons as to how, you know, the current Muslim world got to the position that they got to. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2018.58s)]
*  You're also monolithizing billions of people. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2025.86s)]
*  Of course, quite, quite different, but the, but the doctrines of Islam, the hadith and the, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2034.82s)]
*  and the Quran, it's fundamentally hostile to women, hostile to gays. And I find that I [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2040.26s)]
*  like to live in a culturally Christian country, although I do not. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2051.14s)]
*  Well, he'd love America then, you know, that's right, baby. Culturally Christian. That's why [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2054.9s)]
*  our, our culturally Christians love electing like rapists who want pedophiles in the cabinet [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2061.2200000000003s)]
*  and sex offenders, you know, after taking away women's bodily autonomy. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2068.34s)]
*  Yeah. Historically, Christianity has never been used to oppress gay people. This guy gets it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2075.2200000000003s)]

*  historically Christians have been very kind to gay people. Are you saying that people in desperate [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2083.62s)]
*  and violent circumstances use sociological inventions to organize and mobilize? No way. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2087.54s)]

*  militant atheist types often fall into the awful take that Islam is inherently bad, but only because [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2114.8999999999996s)]

*  possible they're driven by horror at the slaughter in Gaza? Do you think they're driven by horror at [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2300.18s)]

*  atheists have fallen into this trap. Do you get it? Do you understand why I don't like the fucking, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2347.46s)]
*  you know, founding fathers of militant r slash atheist movement. This is it. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2353.3s)]
*  It's just another way to be fucking annoying and races. It's like when liberals do the same old [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2357.62s)]
*  fucking tropes that racist right-wingers engage in by saying black people have a real problem with [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2368.8199999999997s)]

*  Okay. You just tried to find a way to do it in, in a liberal capacity. Okay. Is there homophobia [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2387.7799999999997s)]
*  in the black community? Of course there is just like there's a fuck ton of homophobia in the [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2395.22s)]
*  white community. Singling out black people like this is simply a way to offer yourself some kind [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2399.62s)]

*  right? On its face, you're like, well, that sounds logical to me, you know, cause it's true. It's [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2417.14s)]
*  correct. Yes. Of course there's homophobia in the black community. Okay. Yeah, there is, except [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2422.9s)]
*  singling out black people in this way is, is not only unfair, but also causes you to lose sight of, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2428.9s)]
*  of how homophobia festers in every community. Okay. No, it doesn't sound logical. I mean, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2439.2999999999997s)]
*  on its face, it does. You're just emitting key details. Does that make sense? It also comes with, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2445.54s)]
*  it also comes with a generalization, right? One of the things that I always try to point people [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2452.1s)]
*  in the right direction on is monolithizing marginalized communities. Okay. Grand generalizations [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2458.02s)]
*  of marginalized communities hit way different than when you do it for the dominant in-group [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2465.86s)]
*  white people. Okay. It has a different purpose and it has a different impact. This is very [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2472.42s)]
*  important to contend with. Okay. If you turn around and say all people of, you know, of a, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2478.98s)]
*  you know, insert marginalized background are this way, it's very different than saying all [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2484.98s)]
*  Christians are this way in, in certain instances, like in a place like the United States of America, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2490.1800000000003s)]
*  where Christianity is the dominant force. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2495.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, you mean the students protesting. Well, I recording this. I'm not, I'm not, I don't [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2502.7400000000002s)]
*  do that. Anyway, uh, Hassan's mic is as please. It's going in and out. No, he's getting fucked. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2510.98s)]
*  I don't think so. Reza Oslon, Bill Mars, not very sophisticated professor from UC Riverside. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2517.78s)]
*  Show a bunch of times he's a comedian, but you know, frankly, when it comes to the topic of [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2523.06s)]
*  religion, he's not very sophisticated in the way that he thinks. I mean, the argument about the [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2527.54s)]
*  female genital mutilation being an Islamic problem is a perfect example of that. It's not an Islamic [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2533.14s)]
*  problem. It's an African problem. Cause he says it's a Muslim country problem. He says that in [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2538.82s)]
*  Somalia. Yeah, but that's okay. I don't even agree with the way he that's crazy. That was a wild thing [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2546.9s)]
*  to just is an African problem. That's okay. What that's a wild way to reframe it. God damn. Okay. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2553.78s)]
*  She's like, listen. Yeah. And that's actually empirically, factually incorrect. It's a central [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2561.06s)]
*  African problem. Eritrea has almost 90% female genital mutilation. It's a Christian country. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2566.58s)]
*  Ethiopia has 75% female genital mutilation. It's a Christian country. Nowhere else in the Muslim, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2573.14s)]
*  Muslim majority States is female genital mutilation an issue. But again, this is the [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2580.82s)]
*  problem. What's the correct framing? He should have said it was a, it was most likely a regional [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2585.54s)]
*  issue that is born out of the instability in these countries. But I get what he was trying to say. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2590.98s)]
*  Reza Aslan is an Iranian evangelical convert. Is that you make these facile arguments like that [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2597.06s)]
*  women are somehow mistreated in the Muslim world. Well, that's certainly true in many [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2604.26s)]
*  Muslim majority countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia. Do you know that Muslims have elected [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2608.8199999999997s)]
*  seven women as their heads of States in those Muslim majority countries? How many women? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2613.54s)]
*  But it is not for the most part, Reza Reza, be honest. So for the most part, it is not dude, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2619.62s)]
*  2014. This shit was popping, dude. Yo, you could just, I was about to say things have not changed [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2624.3399999999997s)]
*  at all. Okay. I guess like the language around it has changed a little bit, but like, dude, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2629.2999999999997s)]
*  like, look at this, like anyone that tries to be like, listen, here's the actual truth of the [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2635.06s)]
*  matter. This has nothing to do with Islam. And also interpretations of religion vary from country [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2639.7s)]
*  to country. And ultimately you have to look at fundamentalism and not religion itself. You say [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2645.7s)]
*  some shit like that in any part post 9 11, you say some shit like that ever after 9 11 and people [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2651.06s)]
*  should be like, shut the fuck up. Why don't you go strap yourself with a fucking TNT vest and blow [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2658.98s)]
*  yourself up? Okay. Yeah. Mr. Allahu Akbar. How about you shut your fucking Muslimist [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2664.5s)]
*  Muslimic terrorist ass up [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2670.98s)]
*  a free and open society for women in those States. Well, it's not in Iran. It's not in [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2672.9s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. It certainly is in Indonesia and Malaysia. It certainly is in Bangladesh. It [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2678.5s)]
*  certainly is in Turkey. I mean, again, this is the problem is that you're talking about a religion of [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2683.14s)]
*  one and a half billion people and certainly becomes very easy to just simply paint them all [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2687.14s)]
*  with a single brush by saying, well, in Saudi Arabia, they can't drive. And so therefore [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2692.18s)]
*  that's somehow representative of Islam. It's representative of Saudi Arabia. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2696.8199999999997s)]
*  But they don't have, I mean, I think the bill Mars, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2700.5s)]
*  have you even read Dawkins books? You're just wrong. He didn't take his racist heel [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2703.7s)]
*  turn until the last few years. And you're right. He's not being rabid mask off about it, but there's [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2707.14s)]
*  so much subconscious bias going on. He's old and is whatever we still respect his research and [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2711.2999999999997s)]
*  debunk fundamental creation is. Yeah. I think a lot of people get lost in the sauce of the [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2715.7s)]
*  old work that people have and, and, and just don't understand that like people that might've had [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2719.9399999999996s)]
*  formative works that you appreciate could have turned reactionary later in their lives. Or maybe [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2727.2999999999997s)]
*  they were always reactionary, but they just didn't fucking, you know, they didn't exhibit those [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2732.74s)]
*  tendencies as much in a way that tracks for you. Okay. Somehow representative of Islam. It's [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2737.54s)]
*  representative of Saudi Arabia. And Iran, they don't have, I mean, I think the bill Mars point [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2744.02s)]
*  is that these aren't extremists. We often talk about extremists and that we should crack down [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2749.22s)]
*  on extremists and why aren't Muslims speaking out about extremists in Saudi Arabia when women [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2753.62s)]
*  can't vote and they can't drive and they need permission from their husband. That's not extremists. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2757.94s)]
*  Why aren't we talking more about what that's not extremists. That's commonplace. Why don't we talk [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2762.5s)]
*  more about the commonplace wrong? It's happening in some of these countries. It's extremist when [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2767.22s)]
*  compared to the rights and, and responsibilities of women, Muslim women around the world. It's an [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2773.3s)]
*  extremist way of dealing with it. It's not extremist in that country in Saudi. Yeah. Sam Harris [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2779.6200000000003s)]
*  literally said TSA shouldn't waste their time on travelers from white countries and only inspect [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2784.98s)]
*  Muslims. That's what made me drift away from these grifters. Here's old Hassan Abiy Lord down back [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2788.5s)]
*  when I was at the young Turks, Sam Harris was at the Santa Monica Equinox and I knew who he was [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2792.98s)]
*  because he had debated my uncle recently, but he didn't know who I was obviously, cause I was a [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2798.1000000000004s)]
*  up and comer at TYT. So I approached him and I was like, Oh my God, you're Sam Harris, big fan, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2802.5s)]
*  lying. And we had a very quick conversation about Islam at the Santa Monica Equinox that we were [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2808.1800000000003s)]
*  both working out at. Okay. Quick Lord dump. And in which I asked him about like why he places the [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2814.7400000000002s)]
*  emphasis on Islamic terror at a time when, you know, 90 or not 95, I think at the time it was [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2821.7000000000003s)]
*  75% of domestic terror incidents that take place on us soil were actually white nationalist, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2827.2999999999997s)]
*  far right, anti-government extremists. Okay. I said this directly to him. I was like the data [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2833.54s)]
*  shows that 75% of domestic terror incidents on us soil have happened since 9 11 have happened [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2839.4599999999996s)]
*  in the hands of white supremacists, far right, anti-government extremists. And to which he [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2847.62s)]
*  literally turned around and said, look behind you, there's the Santa Monica pier. Okay. If that [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2853.38s)]
*  exploded right now, who would you think was responsible? Would you think, you know, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2859.3s)]
*  Mormon extremists would be responsible for that? Or would you think Muslim extremists would be [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2864.1800000000003s)]
*  responsible for that? And I was shocked at like how non-data driven his attitude was on this, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2868.6600000000003s)]
*  in this conversation straight up. And for the record, he has personally, he has personally [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2876.58s)]
*  brought that forward as a, as a Epic own many times in public as well. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2884.5s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, that's the norm. Oh, no, it's not. I mean, look, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia. No, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2889.14s)]
*  my response was like, I would not make an inference that it's a Muslim or Mormon until there was more [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2894.3399999999997s)]
*  evidence presented. But why did Sam Harris feel comfortable making this as an argument? And he has [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2899.94s)]
*  actually made this as an argument since then, right? Since that private conversation, why? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2906.9s)]
*  It's because when the overwhelming majority kind of agree with that statement due to the societal [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2912.5s)]
*  attitudes towards Islam as being like a singularly dangerous ideology that creates terrorists, okay. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2920.26s)]
*  Then you can get away with that sort of irrational thinking, because ultimately, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2928.26s)]
*  that's just you being biased, right? That's just simply put you being a biased person. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2932.9s)]
*  And yet it does not matter because if enough people agree with that bias and they take that bias [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2939.38s)]
*  as though it is the truth, then it doesn't matter if you're saying something that is completely [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2946.9s)]
*  illogical. Okay. We feel comfortable saying school shooters are white people know brother, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2951.3s)]
*  did you not hear the first part of this conversation where I told Sam Harris that the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2956.82s)]
*  overwhelming majority 75% of domestic terror incidents on US soil since 9 11 were not done [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2962.1800000000003s)]
*  by Muslims, but instead done by white supremacist anti government far right terrorists like, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2971.38s)]
*  did you just erase that part of the conversation from your brain? Are you choosing not to hear that? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2980.26s)]
*  Okay. That's my point. That's why a lot of here is goes, this is a testament to transphobia and [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2985.78s)]
*  like trans panic defenses, not working all that well. Okay. There's like what one trans person [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2992.7400000000002s)]
*  that did a school shooting. And before then, and ever since then right wingers keep claiming that [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=2999.0600000000004s)]
*  every school shooter or every shooter really there's high profile is trans right over and over and [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3004.26s)]
*  over again. It is statistically marginal. Okay. It is irrelevant. The grand if you want to group [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3009.46s)]
*  the profile of a school shooter or a mass shooter, it's almost always a white guy. Okay. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3016.26s)]
*  With some exceptions having said that, however, it doesn't work when people try to say, oh, it's [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3022.66s)]
*  just, you know, trans people that are doing it, but that hasn't stopped right wingers from [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3028.1s)]
*  consistently claiming that it is a trans person. Okay. Now, the difference is white men specifically [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3034.02s)]
*  dominate in the field of school shooting so aggressively that, you know, and because of the [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3041.38s)]
*  way we analyze whiteness and white people in general in a, you know, country like the United [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3047.78s)]
*  States of America, where whiteness is a, a social, a socio political framing of power. Okay. A social [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3052.9s)]
*  political designation that is basically just saying you're a part of the in-group people don't [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3062.58s)]
*  automatically assume racist opinions about white people. You don't, I'm a white guy. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3067.94s)]
*  Nobody thinks I'm a school shooter. You know what I mean? Like it doesn't work in the same way. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3073.38s)]
*  This is the difference between in-group out-group dynamics. Those who retain power [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3080.2599999999998s)]
*  due to intrinsic qualities in a white supremacist society, you never monolithize those people. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3086.5s)]
*  Okay. You have the capacity to understand that it's a complex and nuanced situation [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3094.18s)]
*  as to how they arrived at that position. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3098.58s)]
*  When it's a white person doing it, you never offer that same kind of nuance. If it's a [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3109.86s)]
*  marginalized person doing it, you just go, that's how they are. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3114.5s)]
*  Is the one of the most, if not the most extremist Muslim country in the world. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3119.22s)]
*  In the month that we've been talking about ISIS and their terrible actions in Iraq and Syria, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3123.54s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, our closest ally, teen people, nobody seems to care about that because Saudi [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3130.1s)]
*  Arabia sort of preserves our national interests. You know, this is the problem is that these kinds [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3135.7s)]
*  of conversations that we're having aren't really being had in any kind of legitimate way. We're [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3141.14s)]
*  not talking about women in the Muslim world. We're using two or three examples to justify [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3144.74s)]
*  a generalization. That's actually the definition of bigotry. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3151.62s)]
*  All right. Fair enough. Let's listen to Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3154.66s)]
*  No way, dude. Things never change. Okay, Kaya. Kaya, okay. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3157.7s)]
*  So when it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas guys. This [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3161.94s)]
*  isn't 2014. Okay. Just so you understand, this isn't 2014. Oh my Lord. This is in 2014. Okay. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3171.78s)]
*  Holy moly. And what they share in common, all militant Islamists share in common. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3182.66s)]
*  Reza, the question at the bottom of the screen that everyone is looking at, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3189.78s)]
*  does Islam promote violence? Islam doesn't promote violence or peace. Islam is just a religion. And [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3193.3s)]
*  like every religion, look at this, does Islam promote violence? Up next on CNN, does every [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3197.78s)]
*  Muslim want to kill every American religion in the world? It depends on what you bring to it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3202.5800000000004s)]
*  If you're a violent person, your Islam, your Judaism, your Christianity, your Hinduism is [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3207.7000000000003s)]
*  going to be violent. There are Buddhist, marauding Buddhist monks in Myanmar slaughtering [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3211.94s)]
*  women and children. Facts. Does Buddhism promote violence? Of course not. People are violent or [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3218.5s)]
*  peaceful. And that depends on their politics, their social world, the way that they see their [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3224.1s)]
*  communities, the way they see themselves. So Reza, you don't think that there's anything more, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3228.82s)]
*  the justice system in Muslim countries you don't think is somehow more primitive or subjugates [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3234.34s)]
*  women more than in other countries? Did you hear what you just said? You said in Muslim countries, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3239.62s)]
*  I just told you that Indonesia women are absolutely 100% equal to men. In Turkey, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3245.2999999999997s)]
*  they have had more female representatives, more female heads of state in Turkey than we have in [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3251.06s)]
*  the United States. Stop saying things like Muslim countries. In Pakistan women are still being [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3256.02s)]
*  stoned. And that's a problem for Pakistan. You're right. So in other words, you, I just want to be [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3261.06s)]
*  clear on what your point is because I thought you and Bill Maher were saying the same thing. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3266.74s)]
*  Your point is that Muslim countries are not to blame. There is nothing particular, there's [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3270.3399999999997s)]
*  no common thread in Muslim countries. You can't paint with a broad brush that somehow their justice [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3276.1s)]
*  system or Sharia law or what they're doing in terms of stoning and female mutilation is different [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3281.2999999999997s)]
*  than in other countries like Western countries. Stoning and mutilation and those barbaric practices [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3288.2599999999998s)]
*  should be condemned and criticized by everyone. The actions of individuals and societies and [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3295.62s)]
*  countries like Iran, like Pakistan, like Saudi Arabia must be condemned because they don't belong [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3302.18s)]
*  in the 21st century. But to say Muslim countries as though Pakistan and Turkey are the same, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3307.8599999999997s)]
*  as though Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are the same, as though somehow what is happening in the most [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3314.66s)]
*  extreme forms of these repressive countries, these autocratic countries, is representative [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3319.86s)]
*  of what's happening in every other Muslim country is frankly, and I use this word seriously, stupid. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3325.3s)]
*  So let's stop doing it. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbaV8HlJHQ&t=3331.2200000000003s)]
