# Gaza Suffers While Trump Collects Billion-Dollar Gifts | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE)
*  the Palestinian population again is precisely because Hamas in a good faith gesture released [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=0.0s)]
*  an American Israeli hostage, a prisoner of and Israel got pissed off that they were talking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=5.68s)]
*  directly to the Trump administration. It made them feel bad. So they made the Palestinians [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=11.28s)]
*  feel their anger and resentment. That's what took place. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=17.84s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes have killed nearly 100 people in northern Gaza, according to Hamas run civil [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=21.2s)]
*  defense teams, it comes US adjacent, but Trump somehow always pulls the leash better than Democrats. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=32.56s)]
*  Yeah, but not in a way that is like going against the previous administration's goals in the region. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  It's just in a way that it's in a way that advances America's interest in the region, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=44.0s)]
*  which are then destruction. Like that's, that's it. It's not, he didn't do anything unique. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=49.28s)]
*  You guys understand that, right? Like the things that he did unique were uniquely corrupt and, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=55.28s)]
*  and cutting out the middleman in terms of like setting side deals for American corporations. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=60.08s)]
*  Instead, he just like lined his own personal pockets in a very obvious way, in a way that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=66.08s)]
*  like people understand people recognize as pure transparent graft. Having said that it's not like [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  he snubbed Israel by not going to Israel in his Middle Eastern tour. And that pissed off a lot of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=76.72s)]
*  arrogant entitled Israeli leaders. Having said that, it's not like he reigned Israel in it's not [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=83.28s)]
*  like he told Israel you're done. Cut it out. No, not at all. He simply said, people in Gaza are, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=89.04s)]
*  that's it. Imagine that people in Gaza are that's all you get. That's like, that's okay. That's a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=97.44s)]
*  little bit better than Biden, I guess. But who knows maybe if Biden's brain was still working [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=104.56s)]
*  at by this point, he might have said something like this too, you know, like, this is some Kamala [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=109.12s)]
*  Harris shit. More than 120 Palestinians. This is we're working tirelessly around the clock for a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire shit. Just so you know, it's just performative. Killed yesterday in the south [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  of the territory. The UN's human rights chief says that Israel's actions are tantamount to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=126.08s)]
*  Palestinians in Bethlehem and Jabalia have described a large scale assault on the ground [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=131.92s)]
*  and from the air and sea in the early hours of this morning. The Israeli military said [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=137.6s)]
*  its troops were dismantling what it called infrastructure. It's not clear whether this [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  operation marks the start of the major new offensive promised by Israel's prime minister [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=147.27999999999997s)]
*  with no sign of progress by negotiating teams in Qatar. Israel doesn't allow independent access to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=152.16s)]
*  Gaza for international journalists, including the BBC. Lucy Williamson reports now from Jerusalem. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=159.28s)]
*  Israel says its target. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=168.56s)]
*  You're so cringe, dude. You're so goddamn cringe and so annoying. I know. How many times have I [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  talked about this? Do I have to bring AOC's name up every time, dude? We know you're not revealing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=181.2s)]
*  something new. Please. Oh my God. Oh my God. Shut the up, dude. Me. Holy is so goddamn annoying. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=187.36s)]
*  Oh my Lord. Every day. Some of you guys are just more invested in constantly talking about AOC than [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=200.08s)]
*  anything else. Like who gives a fuck? I know. We know. We all know. We already criticized it a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  million times over. What do you want me to do? Every day start off with 10 M Israel highs [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=212.16s)]
*  and 10 AOCs. Is that what I should do? So many think your leftist but behave like is so weird. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=217.6s)]
*  Is infrastructure. This is Bet lahya after 19 months of hard to find the scars of this morning's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=223.04s)]
*  assault on a town already in ruins. Residents know where to look for survivors, just not for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=230.96s)]
*  answers. The heavy assault involved tanks, they say, and armored vehicles around a shelter for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=238.64s)]
*  displaced people. We went to the south. We were targeted in the south, Abu Omar said. We came to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Gaza City. We were targeted there. Where should we go? For God's sake, have mercy on us. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  The floor of the nearby Indonesian hospital, a makeshift treatment room, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  a makeshift morgue. These Children now facing life without their mother. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  Where are the hammers negotiators? While this happens to my mom, he cries. The many months of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=270.8s)]
*  doctors say this morning's assault felt different. So the last night, it's like the beginning two [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=276.8s)]
*  months in this aggression. Dr. Salah lost two nieces and a nephew in the attacks, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=282.56s)]
*  two of their bodies unreachable under the rubble. They were eight and 10 years old. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=290.08s)]
*  I see my family is totally destroyed. So there is one person has to be [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=295.92s)]
*  controlled because all of them is crying and shouting all of them. But after that, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=301.36s)]
*  I am go to my office and crying alone. Israel is calling up forces for a major new assault on Gaza, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=306.88s)]
*  saying this time the army will hold the territory it takes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=315.84s)]
*  As a result of the October 7 and as a result of the fact that Hamas is still continuing to hold [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  58 hostages, Israel is forced to carry on fighting. It is not Israel's fault. We didn't ask for this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=327.11999999999995s)]
*  We didn't initiate this. We don't want it to continue on. This is the fault of Hamas. This is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=334.08s)]
*  the fault of insane. The government that he's a part of directly contradicts this statement on [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=339.76s)]
*  a daily fucking basis. But of course, that's not going to stop BBC from covering it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=345.6s)]
*  I wonder if the BBC reporter will turn around BBC in the New York Times, by the way, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=351.44s)]
*  two of the most important news outlets in the Western world have collectively [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=355.6s)]
*  dropped the ball in spectacular fashion. Like Channel four does decent coverage, you know, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=362.56s)]
*  they also sometimes say ridiculous shit. But they do decent coverage in comparison to the BBC. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=369.68s)]
*  Guardian sometimes does decent coverage in comparison to the BBC, where they do like [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=377.6s)]
*  investigative reporting pieces and stuff like that. But God damn is the BBC so bad with this shit. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=382.88s)]
*  Like it is it is completely and utterly unacceptable. The way that they have approached [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  the subject matter is so insane. Because it's a lie. Like this person is just lying, just like [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=397.12s)]
*  I don't know if they like mistranslated the Palestinian or even if they showed the Palestinian [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=406.96s)]
*  that was like, where's Hamas? Where's Hamas? Hamas? Where's the Hamas negotiation? This happened [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=410.08s)]
*  right after Hamas actually in a gesture of good faith, released the hostage without any conditions. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=414.0s)]
*  The reason why Israel is punishing the Palestinian population again, is precisely because Hamas in a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=419.44s)]
*  good faith gesture released an American Israeli hostage, a prisoner of and Israel got pissed off [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=425.36s)]
*  that they were talking directly to the Trump administration. It made them feel bad. So they [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=432.0s)]
*  made the Palestinians feel their anger and resentment. That's what took place. I mean, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=438.16s)]
*  I don't fault the Palestinians for feeling that way in all of this indestruction and simply wanting [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=445.04s)]
*  to stop. But I absolutely fault BBC for not offering some clarity to statements here or [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=449.28s)]
*  clarity to the events that unfolded. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=455.44s)]
*  Bet Lahire was emptying again today. But with no easy way out of Gaza, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=459.11999999999995s)]
*  doctors say that some here are losing the will to leave or to live. We'll die wherever we go, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=464.32s)]
*  people tell them. So why not die here? Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Jerusalem. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=471.52s)]
*  Well, President Trump said for the first time today that a lot of people in Gaza and he vowed [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=477.28s)]
*  that the US would take care of the situation. He was speaking after finishing a tour of them, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=482.4s)]
*  not to visit Israel. So does this signal a shift in support away from Israel? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  Roz Atkins has more. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=492.08s)]
*  World leaders see the same stories from Gaza that we do. Today, it's reports by the Hamas [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=494.08s)]
*  run civil defense agency that another 100 people have been killed by Israeli attacks [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  in the last 24 hours. It's charities that young children are now dying from hunger and disease. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=504.08s)]
*  And it's accounts such as this sent to the BBC by a British doctor working in Gaza. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure it won't be long until we get to a situation where we're seeing pictures of them [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=517.84s)]
*  that image what we saw in the early 80s with the famine in Ethiopia. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=523.6s)]
*  Despite its total blockade of Gaza, Israel says there's no shortage of food there and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=528.64s)]
*  that the real crisis is Hamas looting and selling aid. But there's mounting evidence [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=533.84s)]
*  that there are shortages. A recent UN-backed report said Gaza's whole population, over [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  two million people, is at critical risk of famine. And this week, the UN's humanitarian [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=545.36s)]
*  chief made this plea to world leaders. I ask you to reflect for a moment on what [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=550.72s)]
*  action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st century atrocity [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=557.36s)]
*  to which we bear daily witness in Gaza. Leaders have been responding to what they and we are seeing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  This week, Spain's prime minister called Israel a genocidal state, something that Israel disputes. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=571.52s)]
*  France's president Macron called the Gaza blockade shameful, to which Israel accused him of siding [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  with an organization. For his part, Prime Minister Sakir Starmer said the situation in Gaza is [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=584.56s)]
*  intolerable, calling for aid to be brought in and hostages to be released. And then there's Israel's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=590.0s)]
*  most important ally, America. Talking to the BBC, its top diplomat again called on Hamas to surrender, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=596.56s)]
*  then added, we're not immune to the suffering of the people of Gaza. And President Trump has said this too. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=603.28s)]
*  We're looking at Gaza and we got to get that taken care of. A lot of people, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=611.04s)]
*  a lot of people, there's a lot of bad things going on. Mr Trump also reiterated that hostages held by [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=615.6s)]
*  Hamas must be released. Now, words don't always translate into actions, but language does matter. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=621.04s)]
*  It can point to shifts of policies or approach. And this week, there's some evidence that Israel's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=628.0s)]
*  actions in Gaza are testing even its staunchest allies. The only thing that is appropriate to [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=634.08s)]
*  say in this time and to a group this large is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=640.16s)]
*  in Palestine. New York University says it is withholding the diploma of graduating student [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=648.88s)]
*  Logan Rosos, who condemned the regime in Gaza while delivering a graduation speech. The currently occurring [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=654.4s)]
*  is supported politically and militarily by the United States, is paid for by our tax dollars, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=660.64s)]
*  and has been live streamed to our phones for the past 18 months. In a statement, NYU strongly [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=667.84s)]
*  denounced the student's choice, saying, quote, he lied about the speech he was going to deliver. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=673.12s)]
*  NYU is deeply sorry that the audience was subjected to these remarks and that this moment was stolen [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=678.0s)]
*  by someone who abused a privilege that was conferred upon him. I condemn this and complicity. CNN has [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=684.48s)]
*  reached out to Rosos and NYU for further details. CNN also reached out to the student government for [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=691.12s)]
*  comment on [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVc_nmG6mlE&t=696.88s)]
