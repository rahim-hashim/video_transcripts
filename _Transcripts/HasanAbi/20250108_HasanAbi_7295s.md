# Wildfires Show No Signs Of Containment | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY)
*  He's like, yeah, you know, I just like casually left the house, saw some embers, realized that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=0.0s)]
*  my house was about the burned out in its entirety. And you can kind of see it right behind me. The [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6.16s)]
*  house is gone. Poof. What do you think about what Zuck said about forcing other nations to stop [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=11.28s)]
*  censoring American speech? No, they're not talking about China, Russia. They're talking about [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=19.28s)]
*  Let's check back in on the LA fires and what the day will be like tomorrow. I assume a lot of those [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=23.2s)]
*  schools will be closed. I know you had a chance to visit some of those schools today in your district. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=33.84s)]
*  I want to show our viewers right now Alberto, some photos you sent us. Do you have a count, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=38.4s)]
*  first of all, on the number of schools in the LA area in your district that have actually been [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=43.68s)]
*  destroyed? Yes. So as I said, we have 1000 schools. The ones most impacted are the schools [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=49.2s)]
*  in the Palisades. We were able to evacuate school communities in collaboration with our remarkable [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=57.28s)]
*  first responders yesterday, but two elementary schools burned completely to the ground. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=63.84s)]
*  These schools are attended by over 700 students. We're talking about Marquez Elementary and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=71.44s)]
*  Palisades Elementary and then a high school, Palisades Charter High School, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=78.0s)]
*  providing educational services to over 2000 students sustained serious damage. In fact, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=85.52s)]
*  when I visited, there was an ongoing fire consuming about 30% of the school. It is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=91.2s)]
*  burning bungalows and portable classrooms as well as athletic facilities. The old legacy building [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=98.56s)]
*  was still pretty intact, but we lost two schools valued at millions of dollars and about 30% of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=106.88s)]
*  Palisades High is being threatened as we speak. That's why we are working with Sacramento, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  our state leaders, our federal entities, utilizing our channels to FEMA to achieve the necessary [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  reimbursements for the reconstruction of these fights. Our hearts go out to all those kids and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=126.08s)]
*  their parents. Alberto Carvalho, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for all the important work [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  you're doing and we'll be right back. Kobe believed in himself at the youngest. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=135.92s)]
*  Always been great about getting different perspectives so that we sort of cover the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  waterfront of ideas and perspectives that we want to make sure are getting fed into the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=147.76s)]
*  process. Joe, is this can you? No water in the fire hydrants, no money in FEMA. This is what Joe [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=153.44s)]
*  Biden is leaving me. Thanks, Joe. You tell the audience in the world that this is not a temporary [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=160.88s)]
*  stance. Never. And what I mean by that is this just because you got. Wait, what is this? All right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=168.32s)]
*  Fire, all the other fires. I was just discussing with my boss the other day. I was like, you know, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=173.6s)]
*  I was like, why have they raised my insurance? I'm not even near a fire zone, you know? So we [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=178.32s)]
*  just feel thankful and blessed and out of here. And, you know, this is surreal. We left about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=184.8s)]
*  four o'clock in the morning and never even expecting it. Just because of a little bit of my wife's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=192.96s)]
*  prodding, we took a little extra things that, you know, like our pictures are all digital and stuff [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=198.08s)]
*  like that. So we were able to take all that stuff with nothing great, nothing of a great, great loss [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  in all our documentation we took also. But yeah, so. You said you left your houses were all standing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=210.08s)]
*  Yeah, you just came back in and this is what you saw. Right. Yeah, I was and I have a nonchalant [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=219.28s)]
*  feeling about the whole thing because it's like I'm looking around, nothing's happened. And just as [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  we're just as we're leaving out the driveway, my son looked up, we saw some smoke coming over the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=229.52s)]
*  top. And inside those inside that smoke, we saw some members. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=234.64s)]
*  As much as I thought, but, you know, we had calls and neighbors. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=243.44s)]
*  Be more shalom, bro. Be more shalom. I'm sorry. You are too nonchalant, my goat. He is the he is the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  goat of nonchalance. He's like, yeah, you know, I just like casually left the house, saw some embers, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=260.88s)]
*  realized that my house was about the burned out in its entirety. And you can kind of see it [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=271.2s)]
*  right behind me. The house is gone. Poof. What do you think about what Zuck said about forcing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  other nations to stop censoring American speech? No, they're not talking about China, Russia. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=284.32s)]
*  They're talking about. No, they're talking about Europe chatter. They're not. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=288.08s)]
*  They're just not. They're not going to touch like, first of all, what do you mean, China? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=298.88s)]
*  What Facebook is it? Does Facebook even exist in China? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=302.8s)]
*  No, they want they want right wing sentiment to thrive in Europe. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  That's what they care about. That's 35 miles per hour. And it's those gusts that really cause [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=318.08s)]
*  concerns for the firefighters doing that incredible work in those fire zones. Hers fire. Also those [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=324.4s)]
*  winds at that 20 mile per hour range. Again, there too, those gusts go in that 30, 35, 40 mile per [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  hour range. It could just kind of pop up at any time. Certainly to keep an eye on also the Eden [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  fire there too. We're looking at 40 mile per hour gusts, those steady winds in that 25 mile per hour [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  range. Now here's a great view of how those fire zones are looking. We can see the areas in the red [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=344.16s)]
*  and purple. Those are your real areas of concern. Those are the higher wind speeds over 40 miles per [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=348.88000000000005s)]
*  hour up around the Santa Clarita area down towards the Malibu Hills pushing 40 miles per hour for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=352.88000000000005s)]
*  those wind gusts as well. We can see one small pocket of no concern, but everywhere else again, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=357.04s)]
*  the strong winds and notice too, it's as Santa Ana profile that North Northeast kind of winds [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  bringing that warm air along with those really strong winds still strong tonight into tomorrow. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  So you have to watch all the areas of Southern California. As I mentioned, some areas going down [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=372.4s)]
*  for us for red flag concerns. So here's kind of a overall view how they're kind of starting to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  subside. Some good news for us. So looking at 20 mile per hour winds around Pacific Palisades fire. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=379.76s)]
*  We're going to stay right in that range till tonight, right about 11 p.m. And then tomorrow [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  morning, look at this. Thankfully we start dropping down to single digit wind readings [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  for that Palisades area in terms of the other spots like the the Eden fire. Same kind of idea [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  winds are still going to be fairly strong tonight into the evening hours, but then by [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=398.64s)]
*  late tonight, early tomorrow morning, now we're back down single digits. So there is [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=403.12s)]
*  some relief as far as the winds are concerned, but this is concerned too, how dry things are. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=406.72s)]
*  Teams and single digit unity readings. So this is very, very dry conditions. That's all over [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=411.2s)]
*  Southern California. No one really getting any relief, even especially on those coastal spots [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=416.32s)]
*  where you'd think you'd get more of moisture in the air. Look at that Santa Monica at 7% [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=420.0s)]
*  relative humidity. Now as far as the air quality, that's of course, as you might imagine, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=424.96s)]
*  bad, especially in the fire zones that red indicates unhealthful air for everybody. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=428.64s)]
*  So certainly in those spots, especially just really be careful. Take the precautions needed [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  for you. And so these are the concerns now. So yeah, a little relief is coming our way, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=436.64s)]
*  but of course Dallas has more updates for you at 4 p.m. on ABC 7 right now. David, Ellen, yours. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=440.24s)]
*  This is eye witness news with live breaking news. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  No, what is that audio? And all 29 fire departments in our county are not prepared for this type of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=449.67999999999995s)]
*  widespread disaster. Everybody's just in shock right now. I don't think it's really hit anybody [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=457.44s)]
*  yet. It's just complete devastation. We thought we were going to have the opportunity to come [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=462.55999999999995s)]
*  back to a home and this is what we come back to. And I'm just so excited to be back here. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=466.88s)]
*  And this is what we come back to an unprecedented natural disaster in Los Angeles County. Multiple [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=473.12s)]
*  wildfires burning at once, all of them fueled by fierce Santa Ana winds. Lives and homes have been [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=478.72s)]
*  lost. Entire neighborhoods are burned to the ground. We're working around the clock to bring you up to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=485.36s)]
*  the minute information about these fires. Everything you need to know, including where exactly these [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=490.56s)]
*  fires are burning, who needs to evacuate and how to get help. A special edition of eyewitnesses [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=495.92s)]
*  at four starts right now. Thanks for joining us and David Ono and I'm Ellen Lava. You're watching [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=501.12s)]
*  eyewitness news at four live on abc seven hulu and wherever you stream. We're expecting an update [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=505.12s)]
*  from fire authorities in Pasadena at any moment. First, let's take a look at where these fires are [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=509.52s)]
*  burning right now. There are three big fires that we are keeping an eye on. The palisades, which is [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=513.68s)]
*  the biggest, was the first to start yesterday as the Santa Ana winds picked up about 10 30 in the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=518.72s)]
*  morning. Hours later, the Eaton fire started in Altadena. Five people have been killed in that fire [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=523.6s)]
*  sadly and the palisades and Eaton fire have burned over 25 000 acres combined. There's also the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=529.28s)]
*  Hearst fire in silmar and that fire is holding at about 500 acres. All right, it is sobering. It's [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=534.88s)]
*  incredible. The side from above when we're finally getting a glimpse of how devastating these fires [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  are is basically you just can't describe it. So let's go to Chris Christie overhead in the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=545.76s)]
*  palisades fire right now who is watching the firefight continue. Chris? Yeah David, we're back [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=551.68s)]
*  up over the summit neighborhood in the Pacific palisades. You're taking a live look at a new [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=558.4s)]
*  house fire. It's going to be at the end of Calle de Serra. That's going to be the 1600 block right [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=564.4s)]
*  there that just caught on fire but I want to help you get your bearings here as you widen that a [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=569.52s)]
*  little slowly. First of all, I want to show you how it is really a hit and miss situation along [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=573.92s)]
*  this block and in this entire neighborhood where you have a couple houses that have been touched [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=579.28s)]
*  and some that are still standing but this is at the end of Calle de Serra right next to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=583.44s)]
*  the summit club at Palisades Country Club which is right there on the right side of your screen [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=588.48s)]
*  and you can see the way this wind is blowing the fire and blowing the smoke that that entire club [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=594.8800000000001s)]
*  house and neighborhoods point south of there are an imminent threat of this fire. Again, there is no [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  structure protection in place here in this part of we have seen some fire trucks trying to keep [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=607.36s)]
*  the fire at bay from neighbors who have been spared but right now it is really a precarious [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=612.64s)]
*  situation here in the summit where there is still quite a bit of active flame and very heavy winds [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=617.68s)]
*  continuing to blow through this neighborhood guys. All right, Chris, thank you. We're going to check [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=623.68s)]
*  back with you as as this fire continues to progress. We want to take you now to the other fire of major [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=628.4s)]
*  concern. Altadena, Sophie Flay, you're right in the middle of it last night. What's it look like today? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=634.64s)]
*  David, the wind is not as strong as it was last night but it is still moving these flames quick. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=639.52s)]
*  All around us here we are on Lake Avenue at Topeka where you can actually see law enforcement [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=646.32s)]
*  is shutting down this part of Lake Avenue now. They are directing traffic. We know so far that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=652.48s)]

*  Okay, so now tell them the bad news. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=718.08s)]
*  The bad news is the house burned down. Okay. Okay. No, no, no. Okay. In a not joking way. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=724.24s)]
*  Serious. Very, very close to burning down. Okay. Serious. On a real note. On a real. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=731.44s)]
*  On a real note. Okay. LA is on fire. Okay. There's actually like thousands of homes being [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  burned down right now. The air quality is hazardous. You can't go outside. There's [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=743.76s)]
*  actually a lot of people that were supposed to come today to the stream but I was like, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=748.8s)]
*  stay home. Don't go outside. Roads are blocked. Roads. It's chaos. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=752.8s)]
*  I think they messed up. I think it would have been extra content. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=767.68s)]
*  Okay. To do a marathon stream [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=773.76s)]
*  in the house that is on fire. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=779.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=788.96s)]
*  Called initiative chat. Missed opportunity. A keek streamer would. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=794.4s)]
*  Actually, I'm kind of surprised that kick streamer hasn't [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=803.76s)]
*  weird sense of humor, but okay. God damn, bro. I can't even make a joke about my own backyard [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=813.04s)]
*  lit on fire. Holy moly. Motherfuckers in Ohio are getting upset at me [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=819.84s)]
*  about having gallows humor about my own backyard. Hey man. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=825.84s)]
*  I live here. I don't know if you know this. My grandparents had to evacuate. You know, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  let me throw some fire jokes in the mix. All right. Like, you know, I know plenty of people. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  Naperville Andy's in the chat being like, listen, this is how dare you. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=850.5600000000001s)]
*  How dare you, sir. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=857.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's like when everybody knows people from Florida make jokes about, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=861.2s)]
*  you know, water killing them. And if you live in California, you got to make jokes about fire. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=875.44s)]
*  That's how it is. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  No joke says me from a country and area that rarely experiences these disasters. Yeah. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=884.8s)]
*  Keep Naperville out your motherfucking mouth. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=894.88s)]
*  I would also like to see them stream inside of a house that is on fire. Okay. Now you made it weird. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=902.4s)]
*  Any thoughts about Karen Bass being Africa during the fires? Apparently she was in Ghana. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=914.8s)]
*  I see a lot of people upset about that on socials, but like, how was she supposed to know [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=919.52s)]
*  that there was going to be a, like that part. I don't understand what, like, if you're the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=924.88s)]
*  mayor of Los Angeles, you're never allowed to travel. If you are the mayor of Los Angeles, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=930.0s)]
*  you're not allowed to travel because like a massively consequential natural disaster [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=935.76s)]
*  could happen. It's not like she saw the fire and flew out like Ted Cruz. You know what I mean? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=941.68s)]
*  Like Ted Cruz is bad because he knew that there was a massive crisis in his state and he flew [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=953.5999999999999s)]
*  away to Cancun. Karen Bass was already in Ghana. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=959.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the hell she was doing in Ghana, but it's not like she was, it's not like she [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=963.68s)]
*  escaped the Ghana, you know, there's rust to the sea. Like I think there are valid things [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=975.76s)]
*  that criticize Karen Bass on her hyper-focus on public safety initiatives that keep giving more [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=985.04s)]
*  and more, keep funneling more and more funds to the police department. You know, mismanagement [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=990.96s)]
*  of funds in that regard is a valid thing to critique her on. Okay. But as far as like her [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=996.96s)]
*  being in Ghana, while the fires were ravaging, they got you defending Karen Bass. No, you have [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1005.2s)]
*  to remember, I never defend, I never defend politicians. Okay. I defend the truth. I think [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1011.12s)]
*  that there is valid criticism against Karen Bass. I am not a fan of Karen Bass. Get out of here. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1019.36s)]
*  I despise Karen Bass. I despise all of the Democrats. Well, most of, if not all of the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  Democrats in California politics. Okay. What I am defending in this instance is just the truth. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1031.76s)]
*  My dumb take is that any mayor must never leave city limits, keep them stuck there. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1043.68s)]
*  That's kind of funny. I like that. Sure. Yeah. How was, how was Karen Bass supposed to know [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1049.36s)]
*  that there was a, there was going to be the most consequential wildfire in California history [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  in January. Okay. This is the time where it's not supposed to happen. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1061.12s)]
*  We are not in wildfire season. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1070.9599999999998s)]
*  Okay. Captain goes down the ship. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1079.36s)]
*  Is this the environmental disaster you predicted? No, this one doesn't count. I mean, it definitely [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1086.4799999999998s)]
*  counts as far as like catastrophic climate change related disaster, but I, my prediction happened [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1092.0s)]
*  while it had already started. I didn't know that it was going to get this bad, but I knew that it [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1097.1999999999998s)]
*  was bad already. Next, I'll invite LA County Supervisor and our Supervisor, Catherine Barger. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1101.4399999999998s)]
*  Captain Barger. As I was standing here, one of our Althadena residents came up to me who's very [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1109.76s)]
*  active in the Rotary and he lost his home. I'm hearing this time and time again. And as the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1115.12s)]
*  mayor told you, we went up and took a tour and it is surreal. It is without words that I can even [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1120.7199999999998s)]
*  explain to you what is taking place, especially in my district in Althadena, but also in the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1127.04s)]
*  bordering area of Pasadena. My heart is heavy, but I have to say, and the mayor is absolutely [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1132.96s)]
*  correct. We met with the governor who also met with the president and resources, both financial, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1140.32s)]
*  but also resources for boots on the ground are here and we're going to continue to fight this [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1147.44s)]
*  fight. But I would ask people, please, please, please, if you don't need to be in the area, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1153.28s)]
*  we don't need you in the area. Recognize that when we drove up there, these are fires that are [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1159.2s)]
*  actively taking place as we speak. And there were many people that don't live in the area that just [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  wanted to go up and take a look. We have fire personnel that is fighting this blaze, not only [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1170.24s)]
*  in Althadena, but also in the Palisades area. We need you all to work with us and to those people [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1176.56s)]
*  that want to go up and loot the full weight of the county. And that's going to start with [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1184.4s)]
*  a district attorney who's issuing a press release and is going to make sure. What is happening? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1193.44s)]
*  Like what do you mean if you want to go up there and loot? Like, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1196.88s)]
*  like how is that the first priority? How who's who's thinking about that? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1200.64s)]
*  Our first responders who many of which have been on the line for over 24 hours. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1205.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it's important for us to know that the chief of LA County fire has asked for resources [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1212.4s)]
*  outside the state with the goal to let them go in and begin to fight the fire so that our [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1218.0800000000002s)]
*  firefighters can take a break and then start again. But again, I want to thank [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  our first responders, but I also want to thank our state and federal partners, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1231.04s)]
*  um, uh, congress member to, um, congressman, white sides who represents Santa Corita area. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1234.6399999999999s)]
*  It's very reassuring to know that we have an all hands on deck, both at the state [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1241.76s)]
*  and at the federal level. Um, and we, we, we will rebuild [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1247.36s)]
*  and to my friends out there that have lost their homes. Um, we are here for you [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  as we look forward to what we're going to do to help you rebuild your life. So with that, thank you. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1257.68s)]
*  Next, uh, congress member, Judy Chu. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1269.04s)]
*  Hello, I'm congress member Judy Chu and I just got off the plane from Washington, D.C. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1275.92s)]
*  My heart goes out to those who've lost their homes and their business. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1282.0s)]
*  There she be in Washington, D.C. When these fires were happening, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1286.4s)]
*  Karen Bass is at Ghana. She's in Washington, D.C. What did they know is causing, but I want to tell [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1289.8400000000001s)]
*  you that this morning I was on the phone with the white house and with FEMA and president Biden has [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1295.8400000000001s)]
*  declared this a national disaster. So now the mechanics are set for people to get assistance [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1302.3200000000002s)]
*  for recovery from FEMA. And also FEMA was asked last night by the state of California to declare [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1310.72s)]
*  this eligible for the fire management grants. And indeed it is. So all the expenses that we see [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1318.8s)]
*  for fighting this fire will be reimbursed by the federal government. And also I spoken to supervisor [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1327.92s)]
*  of the San Gabriel mountains. He's asked for help from Washington, D.C. To close the forest areas. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1336.24s)]
*  So I do want to urge everybody, please stay away from the forest area. Uh, and, uh, I just urge [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1342.96s)]
*  everybody to make, will actually rebuild these homes. Seems like they don't build much of [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  anything with respect to housing. Yeah. They must respect the housing market. So when fires like [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1358.16s)]
*  this happen, you must not rebuild. Okay. God forbid, please do not rebuild any additional [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1363.12s)]
*  housing because then the existing housing prices go up even more. Okay. It is illegal to build a [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1368.9599999999998s)]
*  house. What is a house? Okay. It's the grossest thing to build. Absolutely not allowed. They [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1377.52s)]
*  should not build anything else. Okay. Houses rise and fall naturally. Chat is just a part of the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1386.32s)]
*  circle of life. Yeah. They don't rise naturally, but they fall naturally. And then you must never [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1393.76s)]
*  rise anything in its ashes because God forbid you build additional units. Okay. That would be [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1398.8s)]
*  terrifying for those who currently are house owners, myself included. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1405.52s)]
*  And the San Gabriel Valley and who have come to know and love this community. Um, as the supervisor [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1416.32s)]
*  said, we're receiving many, who is a us representative. So a place of work is literally DC Karen Bass has [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1425.76s)]
*  one job just to be in LA to conduct their mayoral duties, which she epically failed at. I think it's [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1431.6799999999998s)]
*  really funny that she was in Ghana while this happened, like she already epically fails at [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1436.32s)]
*  everything that she does. It's just that like, it's additionally funny that like she happened to [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1442.48s)]
*  not be in LA while this occurred. I am not a fan of Karen Bass. I've just, I still don't [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1450.0s)]
*  think that she's supposed to predict these things. You know, make sure that just bad [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1457.76s)]
*  timing care of that. You're taking care of your families. This is what is most important right now. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1461.84s)]
*  Um, it is incredibly dangerous for individuals to be up there during the time when there's fires [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1468.16s)]
*  like this. Um, this is a very, very dangerous time. So please evacuate, get somewhere safe, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1474.64s)]
*  make sure that your family is safe. Um, also if you [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1482.08s)]

*  Okay, let's get back to what actually matters, which is what caused this? What caused this wildfire [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1964.76s)]
*  to actually take place and actually occur? Now, one might think maybe it was a cigarette, but [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1972.9199999999998s)]
*  a lit cigarette that someone tossed outside of their car. But I think tiktokers and hopefully, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1979.0s)]
*  Facebook content creators as well with the new meta policies, we will arrive at the actual truth [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1985.6399999999999s)]
*  of what truly mattered. One caught what appears to be a fucking orb flying down through the fire [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=1990.76s)]
*  and smoke in California. You can clearly see it. It goes, look like fucking Goku flying on a [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2001.3999999999999s)]

*  what the sky, like, I don't even know if this is a, this is fake or not. I don't know if this is [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2218.28s)]
*  fake or not, but it looks exactly like one of those firefighting planes. Like literally that [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2225.2400000000002s)]
*  just dump water. That looks exactly like a firefighting, a plane that, that dumps water [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2230.84s)]
*  over. They go dive into the water, grab the ocean water and then fly back and, and fly low to the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2240.36s)]
*  ground and dump water onto it. Now, having said that, I don't know. I don't even know if this [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2247.88s)]
*  footage is real. It's just like grainy. I don't know where it's from or it's a bird. Yeah. I [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2254.44s)]
*  doubt it's a bird. Do you know how large that would be? Do you know how large of a bird that [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2259.08s)]
*  would be? Don't be a sheep, bro. It's Goku. You're brainwashed by the liberal media. Okay. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2263.88s)]
*  There's a DC 10 actively dumping water. This dude's an idiot. That's what I think as well, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2269.48s)]
*  but, but it's wild, but Hey, guess what, dude? It's not okay. It's not, you know what it is. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2273.48s)]
*  It's Goku or an orb, an alien orb. That shit look like Goku flying through the sky. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2278.7599999999998s)]
*  The slowest comment ever talk about, Oh, that's just a plane trying to fight the fire. What [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2285.56s)]
*  fucking plane do y'all know that goes that close to the fucking fire and can do an angle like this [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2292.28s)]
*  through the fire like that. I mean that, that angle and that all is consistent with the, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2298.36s)]
*  with those planes that dump water over the fire. That, that not saying that what we are watching [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2304.04s)]
*  on that screen is a plane. I don't even know if it's real footage or not, but if it is, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2308.92s)]
*  it's most likely a plane that low to the floor. I'll wait a fuck who the fuck they think they [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2313.96s)]
*  kidding Chelsea Clinton. He'll see Clinton. It's far more likely as a drone. No, it's not. No, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2320.92s)]
*  I'll tell me what the fuck chatter is not far more likely that it's a drone. Do you see how fast? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2327.0s)]
*  Do you see how big it is? Look like Goku flying. How big it is. Look how big it is. Look how fast [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2332.12s)]
*  it's going. What are you saying? Could be souls when we pass, we were able to go anywhere. I had [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2339.16s)]
*  an outer body experience while I was flying, floating, and I seen people, a woman watching [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2344.2799999999997s)]
*  close. She couldn't see me. I had many experience. The fire is like Lahaina, but not nearly equal to [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2348.52s)]
*  the death toll. LA have roads to evacuate. Lahaina did not sustain winds and low humidity will cause [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2355.16s)]
*  fires to break out. So stop the conspiracies. Oh my God. Someone's speaking sense and a tick tock [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2360.52s)]
*  comment section. Look, if y'all live in SoCal, you'd know ally Ali Carter ain't smarter than [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2366.12s)]
*  the rest of us. We have wildfires every year. Ali Carter said there would be fires. Who's Ali [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2372.2s)]
*  Carter? I see the video you talking about, bro. And my kids see something like that. That goes fast [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2378.6s)]
*  and else some moments like the sky turned blue in the nighttime. Why is mainstream news not covering [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2384.04s)]
*  the Ali Carter prediction? Five people have died in this fire. Tragic. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2389.7999999999997s)]
*  So tragic, Giovanna. We know that 10,600 acres have burned in the Eaton fire. It's at 0% containment. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2396.52s)]
*  And we just heard from the Pasadena Fire Chief saying that there are 750 firefighters working [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2403.0s)]
*  on this fire. We know that somewhere between 200 and 500 structures have been damaged or lost. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2408.7599999999998s)]
*  And there are also mandatory evacuation orders in place right now. We are at Lake and Topeka [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2415.3199999999997s)]
*  here in Alta Dena. I mean, are really trying to, trying to make sure people are heating these [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2423.64s)]
*  evacuation orders and staying out of the road. So bro, look at, look at the Pacific Palisades from [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2431.48s)]
*  this drone shot, dude. God damn. God damn, dude. That is crazy. That is utter madness, dude. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2438.2s)]
*  Fire, flight, planes doing same maneuvers. Sometimes it even goes wrong because of how risky [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2453.64s)]
*  it is. There's a cliff from Greece where one crashes, crashes down a hill. So you don't see [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2482.68s)]
*  the direct impact. No, I'm not going to watch that right now. Hope you're safe, brother. I am safe. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2485.3999999999996s)]
*  And what's so surreal is look down the block. It is block after block here in this area in Alta Dena. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2491.24s)]
*  I mean, there's a large, a huge fire there burning several houses. Any other time there would be fire [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2497.72s)]
*  crews blocking off this entire area. But there are just too many fires and they've just got out. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2503.56s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. I think Anderson Cooper is getting cancer after this. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2511.64s)]
*  Like every time I see this man, he's got no mask on. Okay. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2515.96s)]
*  Like I feel like this dude is, has no hope care for his own safety at this point. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2521.8799999999997s)]
*  Because there's so many engines tapping the grid and multiple grids. We're basically just taking [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2527.48s)]
*  all the water out of the grid. So what do you do? I mean, you want to fight these fires. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2532.12s)]
*  We do have water tenders, vehicles that shuttle water to us that carry 2,500 gallons of water. But [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2535.72s)]
*  again, they're stretched thin as well. So they have a lot of demand placed on them. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2543.08s)]
*  So on a scene like this right now, what can you do? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2547.08s)]
*  We are looking at houses that we can save. So things that we can do, we can clear brush away [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2550.52s)]
*  from fences, things that we can do with our hands or with tools. And we just help some homeowners [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2555.9599999999996s)]
*  get out. So just, I mean, first thing is rescue operations. We want you out. Houses can be replaced. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2561.08s)]
*  All that lives cannot [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2566.2799999999997s)]
*  lives cannot. That was just around the corner here earlier today. We're going to, I just want to show [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2570.7599999999998s)]
*  you what's happening right now. So this house, we, as we talked about, it's burned down. The house [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2577.56s)]
*  next door has not, it makes no sense. My man is way too rich, bro. He's a Vanderbilt. What the hell [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2581.08s)]
*  is he doing this close to the fires? Is he trying to, I feel like he's just, he's like, I'm done. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2586.44s)]
*  I want to die. I've done too much. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2591.48s)]
*  We'll stop this house from being destroyed by this fire because embers coming. I mean, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2593.7200000000003s)]
*  we see the flames from here licking that house. So they're trying to keep that roof wet. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2598.68s)]
*  The captain was saying earlier, they really look at the attics. If smoke is pouring out of the [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2604.2000000000003s)]
*  attics, if the roof is on fire, if it's gotten to that point, if it gets into the attic, then the [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2608.2000000000003s)]
*  house, if they don't have enough water, then the house is going to go. Gavin Newsom was in this [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2613.64s)]
*  area. Bro is covered in soot. Look at him, bro. He looks like he looks like one of the, the miners in [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2619.3199999999997s)]
*  Twin Peaks. Just complete and utter devastation. I've been in a lot of these fires a lot going [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2628.6s)]
*  back to paradise and this approximates paradise. It's not a numeric, it's just a feeling sense of [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2634.92s)]
*  loss, place, belonging. Still no containment. No, we're at zero containment. The winds have been a [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2642.28s)]
*  little bit more favorable as you've seen in the last few hours. So we've got the helicopters back [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2648.44s)]
*  up. We've got some fixed wing aircraft out on the coasts. That's a little different. It's pretty [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2652.84s)]
*  intense. We have 23 aerial assets just at the palisades, but a lot of them are not operational. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2658.0400000000004s)]
*  I hate Gavin Newsom so much. He just sounds so fake even here. We've depleted. I don't know why. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2664.44s)]
*  He just gives bad vibes, dude. Hundreds of personnel. Am I wrong? I feel like he's happy [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2670.6s)]
*  kind of. Because he's in front of a camera or something. I don't know what it is. And now [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2677.16s)]
*  we're getting the mutual aid system, the EMAC system. Governors from all across the country [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2681.8s)]
*  are calling. Oregon says engines in Arizona, Utah, we're just grateful for all the support. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2686.04s)]
*  A lot of these firefighters I was talking to on the street, they've been working 26, 27 hours. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2691.96s)]
*  Are they back? That's just going to continue. I mean, there's enough folks here. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2697.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we've got a few thousand. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2700.92s)]
*  Gavin Newsom looking at all of the burning houses, licking his lip, thinking how wonderful this will [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2701.96s)]
*  be for the housing market. He just, he's excited. Look, look on mute. He's excited. The prospect of [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2707.0800000000004s)]
*  the housing markets, the housing market going up even higher than ever before. Gavin Newsom will [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2713.4s)]
*  not rest until upper middle-class managers are also homeless. Do you understand? He has one goal [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2719.8s)]
*  in mind. He wants to make everyone, everyone with the exception of like mega millionaires, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2726.44s)]
*  like a hundred millionaire plus everyone underneath the hundred million dollar net worth line has to [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2733.5600000000004s)]
*  be homeless permanently. He loves it. This is just what it is. He enjoys it. This is his only goal [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2739.96s)]
*  in life. Okay. I'm telling you right now, nothing else. When you have a system, but it's not [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2745.96s)]
*  dissimilar to what we've seen in other extraordinarily large scale fires, whether it be pipe electricity, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2751.16s)]
*  whether it just be the complete overwhelm of the system. I mean, those hydrants are typical for [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2756.52s)]
*  two or three fires, maybe one fire. You have something at this scale, but again, that's going [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2761.16s)]
*  to be determined by the local. What is we're saying part of it is the gravity that it's these [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2765.16s)]
*  giant tanks on top of the mountains, which yeah, well they're going down. We were just with the team. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2769.0s)]
*  They're getting the tenders down to Pasadena, filling things back up, coming back up. So it's [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2773.2400000000002s)]
*  just a good aerial assets. They all sound like RFK junior because they've been just eating smoke [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2777.7200000000003s)]
*  all day, dude. It's been up a little bit earlier, but out on the coast, it's been a little more [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2782.2000000000003s)]
*  stubborn because those winds are swirling. The challenge is you can see that they can fly. It's [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2786.28s)]
*  not a question of turbulence or anything else. It's just the mitigation's flying all over the place. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2793.32s)]
*  So it's not, it doesn't have any benefit necessarily. So we've got National Guard [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2797.4s)]
*  working the rattlesnake teams out there on the line. We're also trying to bring them in to [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2802.84s)]
*  supplement some of the law enforcement efforts as well. It's all hands on deck across the spectrum. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2807.8s)]
*  The biggest thing though, Anderson, that happened today sincerely, and you can appreciate in a [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2812.84s)]
*  community like this to get that direct individual assistance with the major disaster declaration [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2817.4s)]
*  within 36 hours of this incident from the president was a game changer for this community, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2822.52s)]
*  for small businesses, et cetera. So not that we're thinking about the next phase, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2827.8s)]
*  but we have to be thinking concurrently about the next phase is how we rebuild this community. But [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2832.52s)]
*  right now we're in this mitigation phase. We're in the public safety phase. I hate to even ask [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2837.32s)]
*  this question, but the president elect chose to attack you, blame you for this. One can't even [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2841.64s)]
*  respond to it. I mean, it's, people are literally fleeing. People have lost their lives. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2848.36s)]
*  Kids lost their schools. Families completely torn asunder. Churches burned down. This guy wanted to [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2856.36s)]
*  politicize it. I have a lot of thoughts and I know what I want to say. I won't. I stood next to a [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2863.56s)]
*  president of the United States of America today and I was proud to be with Joe Biden and he had [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2871.2400000000002s)]
*  the backs of every single person in this community. Didn't play politics, didn't try to [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2875.72s)]
*  divide any of us. Finally, your message to the folks here, to this community. I mean, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2878.9199999999996s)]
*  we have their backs and we're going to be back and this is going to be a long, long, long recovery [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2883.56s)]
*  process. But look, we have residents moving back into Paradise, California. I've seen remarkable [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2887.8799999999997s)]
*  recovery efforts. I've seen remarkable sense of community purpose resilience. So I'm not just [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2892.9199999999996s)]
*  playing the politician role of optimism. I really am long-term optimistic, but the devastation to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2899.4s)]
*  hear people wailing and crying, concerned about their pet, their family. They're just bewildered [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2905.96s)]
*  about what's just, what they're experiencing. And again, not just experience. I was not talking [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2911.6400000000003s)]
*  past tense. This is happening in real time. Zero percent containment. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2916.2000000000003s)]
*  Now, this is Governor Gavin Newsom. I spoke to him about an hour ago, literally just up the block. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2921.88s)]
*  He was out here with fire crews, talking to fire officials, trying to assess the damage, figure out [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2926.04s)]
*  next steps. I also ran into a woman just around the corner. We saw her out on her lawn with a [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2933.08s)]
*  watering can, pouring water from a watering can, trying to keep the lawn wet to save her house. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2941.56s)]
*  Miraculously, her house is still standing. There's about four or five on that side of the street, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2948.52s)]
*  which are. And I just want you to hear from her. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2953.0s)]
*  Maybe 3 a.m. we heard how your phone has that terrible alert. And we just, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2960.12s)]
*  no lights, just the lights from everybody's car, headlights in their driveways, and everybody on [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2967.08s)]
*  the street just cramming their possessions and pets and kids into cars. And then we went to [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2972.2s)]
*  my husband's sister's house. And then you can't find any news. There's no way to know if your [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2978.36s)]
*  house burned down or not. This is the best neighborhood everybody knows. Before he left [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2983.6400000000003s)]
*  our neighbor Brad here, he was putting out little fires on, you know, before he felt like he just [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2990.28s)]
*  had to go. He was putting out little fires on our property. And who knows? Maybe that saved our house, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=2996.36s)]
*  but that's the kind of neighborhood we have. And it's, you know, most of it's gone now, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3001.0s)]
*  especially. I want to go to a press conference. Mayor Karen Bass, let's listen in for you. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3005.56s)]
*  And we stand with you. I know the world is looking at images of our city's devastation. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3012.7599999999998s)]
*  I have seen the front lines of the Palisades fire and it is staggering. Yeah, she saw it from her [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3019.4s)]
*  plane landing from Ghana with county, state and federal officials. I took the fastest route back, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3026.44s)]
*  which included being on a military plane, which facilitated our communications. So I was able to [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3033.96s)]
*  be on the phone the entire time. Oh my gosh, she's ass covering. We are fighting for you and everyone [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3040.92s)]
*  in Los Angeles. Oh my God. Thank you to our first responders who waited in the flames, pulled people [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3047.08s)]
*  from cars and got them to safety no matter how dangerous. And thank you to everyone who heeded [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3053.2400000000002s)]
*  our warnings to evacuate tonight. More people may get evacuation orders and if they do, please leave [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3060.52s)]
*  immediately. If you have an evacuation warning, get ready to go, protect yourself and each other [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3069.08s)]
*  and support our firefighters on the front line. Avenue Vista Street. It is time to evacuate now. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3077.16s)]
*  This fire is just about a hundred feet from the end of Carson Avenue and this entire area is going [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3083.72s)]
*  to be evacuated momentarily. You saw that fire helicopter fly through the shot. It gives you a [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3089.88s)]
*  little bit of the idea of scale because that helicopter was a dot when it flew through the [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3094.84s)]
*  foreground of that fire. This is a large fire that is spreading exponentially here in the last couple [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3099.88s)]
*  of minutes. If we can widen out a little more, you can see it now taking more of a vertical position [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3105.8s)]
*  up the canyon from top to bottom. It's spreading in multiple directions. It's moving uphill with [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3110.52s)]
*  the terrain and you have spot fires being blown towards Hollywood. This is a fire that is literally [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3116.92s)]
*  right in the smack dab in the middle of the Hollywood Hills due north of Hollywood Boulevard, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3124.52s)]
*  no more than a mile off of the Boulevard and it's already spotty. Look at that, a big spot fire right [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3130.04s)]
*  there in the middle of your screen. Go ahead and push out, push in right there. And that spot's [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3135.32s)]
*  right there. That one spot is going to go up and grow exponentially here as we keep an eye on it [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3139.48s)]
*  and it's going to continue to blow. These winds are going to continue to blow this fire towards [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3146.28s)]
*  the city of Hollywood. This is something we have to really watch closely here. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3152.0400000000004s)]
*  Okay, I have my documents and stuff. Go ahead, let's start getting some more of the streets, Lucas. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3158.84s)]
*  We need to get people out of this neighborhood. Chris, this is devastating to watch. We've already [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3163.7200000000003s)]
*  seen so much destruction. I just can't imagine, I can't process having another fire and another [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3168.92s)]
*  swath of homes in danger. But I just want to take a moment to announce that LA Unified Schools, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3174.04s)]
*  all LA Unified Schools, will be closed tomorrow. So we want to get that information out there. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3181.08s)]
*  All right, so can we get the satellite view? Is it possible for your camera person to give us [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3185.8s)]
*  that satellite daytime view just for a second so we get a sense of it? The overlay, the overlay, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3192.44s)]
*  give them the overlay if you can. If not, nobody can. I'm sorry, Mark, it might not be available [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3198.2799999999997s)]
*  right now, I apologize. But just look at that spot fire. Look at that spot fire that sparked [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3203.64s)]
*  up 30 seconds ago and look at the size of it now. It's over 200 feet right now. It started as a [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3207.7999999999997s)]
*  little speck. Go ahead and push right in on that fire, right there, middle of the screen. Go push [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3214.04s)]
*  right in there. That spot fire is already exponentially growing. Wow, yeah, it started [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3218.44s)]
*  as a pretty small spot. We all saw it erupt there and it is growing. Let's give the street names [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3225.3199999999997s)]
*  again if we could. Kersen was one of them. Quiet now, Lucas. Rottles Drive, Kersen Avenue, Kersen [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3231.0s)]
*  Place, Kersen Terrace, Bonita Avenue, Hillside Avenue, Vista Street. Go ahead and push down a [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3240.04s)]
*  little bit. Just tilt down slightly. You mentioned Bonita Street too. Sierra Bonita, Sierra Bonita, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3246.68s)]
*  Franklin Avenue, Franklin Avenue, Gardiner Street, which is where the fire department is responding [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3254.12s)]
*  right now. Almost certainly they'll have LAPD going door to door here to start evacuating this [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3259.72s)]
*  neighborhood. Stanley Avenue and Nichols Canyon Road. This whole section here between Vista Street [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3264.7599999999998s)]
*  and Nichols Canyon is under the gun right now. And so heavily populated. So many apartments and [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3271.08s)]
*  homes very close together. We are in the heart of Hollywood, guys. This thing is spotting and growing [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3277.0s)]
*  by the second. I can't emphasize it enough. There is no way to dramatize this. This is real [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3285.08s)]
*  and happening in real time and it's happening fast just in the last 10 minutes. Excuse myself [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3290.7599999999998s)]
*  so we can go ahead and start to strategize and move towards mitigating this additional [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3297.08s)]
*  major emergency in the city. Thank you. All right. That was Fire Chief Kristen Crowley, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3305.08s)]
*  I think, excusing herself. It's what I believe is happening so that she could address this fire [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3311.16s)]
*  that we're watching here. The reason she knows about it is because Chris Christie spotted the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3317.72s)]
*  glow in the sky. He was over, right? You were over the Palisades fire. You saw the glow from this one, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3321.56s)]
*  came over to investigate and discovered the fire. That's exactly right. It started as a speck in the [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3327.64s)]
*  distance. We weren't even sure. I almost, my eyes, I couldn't even believe what I was looking at, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3335.3199999999997s)]
*  to be quite honest. As we got closer, it became very apparent because it was growing and flaring [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3339.48s)]
*  up right before our eyes. It only took us a couple of minutes to get over here. Just in the last few [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3344.6s)]
*  minutes that we've been on the air, I can tell you it has at least quadrupled in size. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3349.2400000000002s)]
*  With these winds, even though they have died down and we've been hearing that they were [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3355.88s)]
*  scheduled to die down a little bit after 6 p.m., they are still blowing. They're still blowing. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3360.44s)]
*  Even if it's 10-15 miles an hour, the embers can fly and start new fires very easily, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3365.88s)]
*  as we've already seen when you showed us that spot fire. Chris? I'm sorry, one more time, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3373.6400000000003s)]
*  Giovanna. I apologize. It was not a question. I was just commenting that it is such a, the winds [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3379.96s)]
*  are still blowing and embers will fly. It is just so easy. We've seen over the last couple of days [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3384.2000000000003s)]
*  how easy it is for embers to fly to different areas and start spot fires and set homes on fires. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3389.56s)]
*  It's just a very, very scary situation. That's exactly what's happening. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3398.12s)]
*  That's why it's already, look how close it is now to Waddles Drive. There are houses on the other [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3401.88s)]
*  side of the fire. We are now slightly on the west side, looking more towards the east and it's [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3406.12s)]
*  already starting to encroach on the end of that street. I can't tell if Sky Map is exactly lined [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3410.92s)]
*  up. I'm trying to match those lines up with the lights in the neighborhood. I'm not sure if the [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3416.6s)]
*  power is out down there, but you can see there's a few house lights. The fire is significant and [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3420.8399999999997s)]
*  moving uphill with potential exposure to the next five to ten minutes per incident command. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3424.6s)]
*  And this fire is continuing to spot in the southerly direction. It's moving in the direction of the [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3428.44s)]
*  valley. It's moving in the opposite direction it seems. Fire appears to be 10 acres in the canyon [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3431.88s)]
*  and is being pushed south by northern winds 10 minutes ago, but it's now saying fire is significant [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3438.44s)]
*  moving up the hill. Basically it's Waddles Garden Park kind of is where this area is. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3443.72s)]
*  This is Kerson Avenue that you were talking about. I have watch duty. Yes, I'm monitoring it from [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3448.2s)]
*  watch duty. No, it's going south. To the left, Kerson Place and going down and all down here. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3452.6s)]
*  That's Hollywood. What we're seeing essentially from your position, if I got to widen it out, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3460.12s)]
*  I think I lost it, is that it will spread. Dude, get ready. It'll be blowing in the direction. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3465.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm ready to go. Like I have my stuff packed. Those flames are, of course, that's Hollywood. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3471.48s)]
*  You're talking about a lot of apartments, as we've been saying, a lot of residences, a lot of homes, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3476.84s)]
*  and they are all kind of in the path of this fire right now. I am prepared. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3481.96s)]
*  Fire department, Kristen Crowley, having had to excuse herself from that press conference she [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3486.68s)]
*  was dealing with in order to deal with this new fire and the we saw one drop, right? Are you seeing [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3491.32s)]
*  other resources that are arriving on scene? I could tell you they are now attaching a number [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3498.04s)]
*  of units from all over the city as well as the San Fernando Valley and LA County fire is now [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3503.8s)]
*  dispatching a number of units to help out. Dude, that's crazy. Resources are stretched so thin [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3509.96s)]
*  that they are requiring all hands on deck for this one. Anybody available is going to be heading to [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3515.72s)]
*  this fire as it's continuing. Just in the last few seconds while you were talking there, Mark, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3520.68s)]
*  look at this thing blowing up. It is blowing up and spotting ahead of itself as the wind is [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3526.2s)]
*  literally shoving it south. I mean, these winds are still coming through here at a decent clip. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3531.72s)]
*  I don't have an exact reading. You don't understand. Like this is not what the hill looks like. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3536.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. The amount of houses, the amount of houses that are there, the amount of apartments that are [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3541.48s)]
*  there is crazy. Developed by that smoke. Look at that plume of smoke being blown from north to south [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3546.6s)]
*  and the entire section of Hollywood that we're looking at here is about to be blanketed in thick [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3552.68s)]
*  smoke. All right, we're just getting word from Dallas that the wind right now is blowing at about [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3558.3599999999997s)]
*  15 to 20 miles an hour with gusts at 28. There's enough certainly to send. Hey, I'm live. You know. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3565.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we're still obviously under the red flag conditions, which we have been talking about. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3574.2s)]
*  Those are going to stay up for at least another 24 hours. The view on the left is from our LAX [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3577.8s)]
*  camera and the view on the right, of course, is from Air 7. Chris Christie in Air 7 monitoring [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3583.2400000000002s)]
*  this fire that is broken out in the Hollywood Hills just above Hollywood. It's in a canyon, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3589.5600000000004s)]
*  a recreational area between Runyon Canyon Park and Nichols Canyon Road. And it is basically the [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3593.8s)]
*  upper Waddles Crest Trail that kind of intersects this area. It is burning south toward Hollywood. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3601.48s)]
*  It's burning both north toward Mulholland, driven by the terrain and pushed by the wind [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3608.92s)]
*  south toward Hollywood. You're looking at the streets there. SkyMap is showing you the streets [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3614.36s)]
*  that are in the direct path of this fire. Kersen Avenue, Kersen Terrace, North Vista Street, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3619.32s)]
*  Runyon Canyon Road, Hillside Avenue, and then down as you get into Hollywood, Franklin Avenue. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3626.12s)]
*  Chris, what are you seeing in terms of we saw that one helicopter from the LA, we believe it was LA [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3631.88s)]
*  City Fire that actually made a drop earlier. What are you seeing in terms of other resources? Are [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3637.56s)]
*  you seeing police officers? You're seeing vehicles leaving. Mark, I can tell you I'm going to jump [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3643.4s)]
*  in here, Chris. I can tell you County Fire was asked to join this firefight. They're sending [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3648.12s)]
*  mutual aid now. We understand fire. One, three, and four are now over the fire. Oh no, I'm sorry, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3653.24s)]
*  guys. Jovon, I've got to interrupt you. Go ahead, widen out, Lucas. You've got police on Runyon Canyon [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3661.16s)]
*  Road. Go ahead, tilt over to the left. And now a new spot fire, a new spot fire starting at the end [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3666.2799999999997s)]
*  of Vista Street right there. A small little speck right now. Let's see what it does. I do not know [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3671.08s)]
*  what kind of fuel is around that fire, but we can only assume the worst. That's it. That's where [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3675.9599999999996s)]
*  the houses are. That little fire right there is shooting up embers at the end of Vista Street [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3680.52s)]
*  with the winds blowing in the southerly direction. That spot fire is about 100 yards away from the [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3685.96s)]
*  initial fire. 100 yards south, 100 yards closer to this neighborhood. Now only about less than, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3693.4s)]
*  well under a mile from Hollywood Boulevard. So what would you say about a fire, bro? Nothing, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3700.76s)]
*  just my dog right now is how a small fire can become a big fire. This is how all of these fires [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3705.08s)]
*  that we've been, we've been dealing with that are now thousands of acres in size and thousands of [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3711.96s)]
*  structures have burned. This is how they grow driven by the winds pushed along. This literally [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3715.96s)]
*  is how fast it happens. By the way, you, and then we just went from, Oh, brush fire on Runyon Canyon [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3722.2s)]
*  to everyone in this area, like 20, 30,000 people. This area is all I'm telling you, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3727.88s)]
*  this area is all apartments right at the ass cheeks, right at the ass cheeks of [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3735.56s)]
*  Runyon Canyon is all apartments. Will and, and Carolina most likely going to come here now. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3742.04s)]
*  They're evacuating here, but I told them like we might have to evacuate as well, potentially from [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3749.2400000000002s)]
*  here. If this spreads even further, I don't think so, but you never know, bro. You're going to play [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3757.4s)]
*  Marvel rivals tonight or chat acting out again and watching this or getting that's crazy. That's a [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3763.8s)]
*  crazy question to ask, dude. The answer is yes. We'll be playing Marvel rivals right now on fire [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3775.56s)]
*  edition. But this has now spread this, this fire itself is at least at least 50 acres as we look at [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3782.76s)]
*  this in just the last few minutes, go ahead and widen out a little bit. And you could tell Mark, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3792.92s)]
*  just in the last few minutes, since we first came down, you can see the size of this fire from top [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3797.48s)]
*  to bottom there. Now parallel in Kersen Avenue, getting closer to Sierra Bonita Avenue, closer to [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3802.0400000000004s)]
*  Hillside Avenue, closer to North Vista Street. That's where that spot fire is just to the north [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3808.2s)]
*  of North Vista Street. All right. And what Giovanna was trying to mention to us earlier [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3813.56s)]
*  is that the city of LA, LA FD is asking for 15 additional engines from the valley or the city. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3818.2s)]
*  They are just arriving. This is so unimaginably good as quickly as they can, because this is [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3824.8399999999997s)]
*  a nightmare scenario for the fire department is at another canyon. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3832.44s)]
*  It's not just any canyon either. It's like, if this, if this turns to pass through Pacific [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3837.96s)]
*  Palisades, there are a shitload more people that are right there. Kersen Avenue, Kersen Place. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3844.04s)]
*  Like this is not, this is an incredibly populated area. I can't just run and people panic and run [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3850.8399999999997s)]
*  before evacuation starts. Then Rose get clogged. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not going to like, I'm not [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3859.08s)]
*  going to get out until I have to, but, but as soon as I saw the fire, I was like, I texted [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3864.36s)]
*  Will and Caroline. I was like, you need to get out right now because they haven't actually given [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3871.4s)]
*  evacuation orders yet. Mandatory evacuation orders yet here, but like this is going to happen. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3877.24s)]
*  I'm still far away. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3882.52s)]
*  He's throwing spot fires, brother. You should not feel like there's any certainty in direction [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3899.0s)]
*  or safety right now in the general vicinity. Chad, there is chatters. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3902.28s)]
*  I don't know the latest fire break out, broke out a few minutes chatters. There is [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3907.56s)]
*  miles of concrete buildings between me and this area. That's why I'm saying I'm [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3913.88s)]
*  sitting in waiting. There are not miles of concrete buildings between this fire and where some of my [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3921.96s)]
*  friends live. There's actually no buildings whatsoever. They are the concrete buildings [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3928.7599999999998s)]
*  between this fire. Okay. That's all I'm saying. I think at this point, you should probably [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3933.56s)]
*  understand that. Like I have a decent understanding of where things are in Los Angeles. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3939.4s)]
*  We have, we watched this happen in real time. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3948.7599999999998s)]
*  60 acres directly towards Hollywood Boulevard. You're looking at several of the neighborhoods [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3955.24s)]
*  that extend into the hills here, just west of Runyon Canyon Road. We're talking about Franklin, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3960.84s)]
*  Vista Street, Kersen Avenue. Aren't there three fires? Yes, there were three fires. Hearst Palisades [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3966.52s)]
*  and Eaton. This is new. It's on Runyon Canyon. This just started literally 10 minutes ago. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3972.36s)]
*  We watched it happen. We watched it start as a tiny spark into what you are looking at right now [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3977.2400000000002s)]
*  with spot fires, with spot fires going all the way down to where people live basically. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=3982.44s)]
*  The way the wind blows through those canyons, it's really a travesty to watch this because [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4007.48s)]
*  it's just a matter of seconds as we've been watching this fire has exploded in size [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4011.4s)]
*  and the topography of this mountain and the hill size, it's going to be really difficult for those [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4015.7200000000003s)]
*  people to all evacuate in an orderly manner, which is, it's always a tough time. And just to let you [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4019.8s)]
*  know, Chris, Philip in our weather department is working on a map. We're going to try to put that [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4025.4s)]
*  up as soon as it is ready, but we're going to show you the proximity of this fire and these communities [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4030.2000000000003s)]
*  that you've been talking about that could be in danger right now and may need an evacuation [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4035.4s)]
*  order. But go ahead, continue your coverage while we prepare that map. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4042.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just looking for any sign of traffic. Anybody who's self-evacuating, looking for any [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4049.08s)]
*  sign of that right now, you don't see a lot. It's actually somewhat of a quiet night over here [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4053.96s)]
*  for the most part. As I look up Hollywood Boulevard, traffic is pretty light. I would [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4058.44s)]
*  love to see more people coming down and out of that neighborhood, but right now we don't see a [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4062.76s)]
*  lot of car lights or headlights coming out of there just yet. Hard to see. It's very difficult [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4067.2400000000002s)]
*  with the sun going down, but just trying to decipher any signs of movement that we can. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4071.88s)]
*  Dude, that is insane. That is nutty mode. Starting to obscure our view over this section of Hollywood. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4076.2000000000003s)]
*  Earlier we had a perfectly clear view of the area. This is Hollywood, Chad. I'm still further down. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4085.0s)]
*  Hollywood Boulevard, you can see those house lights very clearly. Now you can see a large [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4089.8s)]
*  plume of smoke enveloping a large portion of Hollywood. To the right of where this is is [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4095.1600000000003s)]
*  Hollywood. Behind it is the valley, or where it's near the Hollywood Bowl. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4102.92s)]
*  And precisely Fuller Avenue. Let's say between Stanley and Fuller. This whole section needs to [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4107.56s)]
*  be evacuated. LA City Fire is pouring everything at this fire, but as much as they are trying [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4112.92s)]
*  to get into place right now, we have seen a total of one water drop, maybe two or three that we [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4118.2s)]
*  didn't catch, but very between this fire going on and the neighborhood that I live in is [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4124.2s)]
*  approximately five miles worth of concrete. We're going to set that map up now. It is [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4130.84s)]
*  ready, but this is definitely a lot closer. I mean, and there's a little bit. There are people [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4135.8s)]
*  who live literally right there. Like you see this, you could see it burning. That is what Air 7 has [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4140.12s)]
*  been showing you, but it's burning down the hill and look how enormous that community is. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4146.28s)]
*  And we'll put this up on the touch screen map as well eventually to show you the tremendous [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4151.32s)]
*  amount of property that we're talking about. All the homes and businesses, but Hollywood and [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4157.0s)]
*  Highland is there. If anybody has been through Hollywood and Highland, which is most of you, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4160.92s)]
*  you know how congested and... This is what it looks like on the street level. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4165.4s)]
*  That's how close this fire is and it's moving really quickly. So the concern is what's going [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4168.759999999999s)]
*  to happen if this fire continues to burn down the hill and reach that very populated area [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4174.6s)]
*  of Hollywood? And this is exactly that. Philip is going to showing us the direction of the fire [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4179.64s)]
*  and who is in danger. And there are a number of different neighborhoods, homes and streets. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4186.76s)]
*  All right. Mandatory evacuation order is now in place for Laurel Canyon Boulevard on the West [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4193.160000000001s)]
*  to Mulholland Drive on the North to the 101 freeway. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4199.32s)]
*  There are probably chatters in here that are literally right next to this, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4222.36s)]
*  like live right next to this. You're getting a better idea of just how close this is now [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4225.64s)]
*  to Kersen. Kersen Avenue was the closest street when we first arrived. Now Kersen Avenue is in [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4229.400000000001s)]
*  the thick of this. What I'd like to do, Johnny, if it's possible, can we get over to the West side to [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4235.0s)]
*  see how close it's getting over to these houses? I fear that there may already be houses that are [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4240.200000000001s)]
*  within feet of the flames here, David. Chris, I have another map for you that we could pop up. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4245.72s)]
*  We could even split screen it if you want inside the booth. But here's a touch screen. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4252.28s)]
*  And this is what we're looking at. I'm going to expand out a little. This Waddles Garden Park, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4257.0s)]
*  this is where the fire is right now. It is burning in this direction. If I expand out even further, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4262.12s)]
*  this is Kersen right here. And look at the homes that are along Kersen. But let's say, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4268.84s)]
*  hypothetically, if this fire continues to burn in this direction, which is where it's going, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4274.2s)]
*  look at everything that's in its way from these big properties. But getting down to Kersen, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4279.16s)]
*  and then you start getting into this massive amount of a populated area. And for perspective, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4284.36s)]
*  we talked to you about Hollywood and Highland. I'm going to move the map over. Right over here [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4290.84s)]
*  is, let me expand out a little bit more, there's Highland and Hollywood Boulevard is right here. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4297.32s)]
*  So the fire is here. It's burning in this direction. And all of this populated area, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4302.2s)]
*  Hollywood Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Highland Avenue going up and down, all of this could be in [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4308.28s)]
*  danger. Chris, I'm going to throw it back to you. That's right. You can see air resources pouring [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4314.759999999999s)]
*  in here trying to get water on this fire. They're going to start with the leading edge here, but that [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4319.8s)]
*  might have been just a recon plane. Not sure if you made a drop or not. I didn't see it. Did you [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4325.0s)]
*  see it, Lucas? I can't tell. But go ahead. Now that we're on the west side of this fire, you can [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4328.04s)]
*  see the distance between Kersen Avenue and the closest flames here. So fortunately, the neighborhood [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4333.24s)]
*  along Kersen has not yet been touched. The wind is blowing parallel to Kersen more directly towards [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4339.16s)]
*  Franklin and towards Hollywood Boulevard. So that's the main body of fire there. Let's go ahead and [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4346.44s)]
*  widen out again, Lucas, and show the proximity to Hollywood Boulevard from this angle. You're going [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4351.639999999999s)]
*  to get a better idea of the geography here is that fire is being blown downhill through the [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4357.0s)]
*  Hollywood Hills towards Hillside Avenue, towards Gardner Street, where LAFD is responding, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4363.16s)]
*  towards Vista Street, Sierra Bonita, and ultimately Hollywood Boulevard is now no more than three [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4368.92s)]
*  quarters of a mile, maybe only a half a mile away from the leading edge of this fire. That is crazy. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4375.96s)]
*  But it's not spreading like a normal fire. It's spreading like a Santa Ana fire because it has [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4380.36s)]
*  been spotting for the last half hour steadily. Dry brush there. So much fuel there for it to burn. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4385.32s)]
*  It's incredible, Chris. We're going to bring in Margaret Stewart from LA City Fire on the phone to [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4391.08s)]
*  let us know more information on this. Margaret? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4395.639999999999s)]
*  Hello? Hi there, Margaret. It's Ellen and David. Yes, what can you tell us about this fire, this one [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4401.4s)]
*  that has broken out in just the last few minutes? Yeah, so we need to get the word out to all your [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4407.0s)]
*  viewers that we have an immediate evacuation order in place in the Runyon Canyon area. So the [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4411.96s)]
*  east border is the 101 Freeway, the north border is Mulholland, the west border is Laurel Canyon, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4418.28s)]
*  and the south border is Hollywood Boulevard. Can you say that one more time? I'm so sorry, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4427.0s)]
*  but one more time. We're slowly writing it down, but yeah, thank you. Absolutely. And we are working [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4432.28s)]
*  on a map as we speak, and so we'll have that up shortly. Chatters, calm down, okay? People from [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4437.88s)]
*  right at the ass cheeks of this fire are coming here to evacuate. You're being ridiculous by telling [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4445.400000000001s)]
*  me to evacuate right now. I'm not near it, okay? It is definitely much closer than all of the other [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4450.12s)]
*  fires, and the direction of the fire is, like, there, I don't know how to describe this. There are [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4456.68s)]
*  10 miles of concrete apartments in between me and this fire. You're making it seem like I'm [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4464.6s)]
*  literally on fire right now. I'm already prepared for evacuation if need be. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4471.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm sorry, I got you. Please leave your house with doors unlocked. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4482.200000000001s)]
*  So we have over 20 additional fire engines that are in route right now and on scene. I'm sorry, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4486.92s)]
*  we're, this is a very dynamic situation. We're the try man companies assigned to this incident. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4497.72s)]
*  And we have air resources that have redirected. As we mentioned, this is obviously an explosive [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4504.5199999999995s)]
*  fire. So looters do exist. Looters are going to have a hard time when they come in here and [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4510.759999999999s)]
*  realize that I have nothing of value, like except for cameras, I guess. I'll repeat it again. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4516.84s)]
*  Chatters be like, come on, bro, please leave, please leave your house on lock. It's like, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4524.44s)]
*  what are you going to take my Zin towers and my poise to the south is Hollywood Boulevard. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4528.04s)]
*  And I will say to our view. Go ahead. I'm going to say we understand that this is a heavily [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4534.76s)]
*  populated area. So we ask people to grab exactly what they need to get out the door. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4540.52s)]
*  This is not a time to delay. This is not a time to try to use a garden hose to protect your home. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4547.08s)]
*  As we've already seen what can happen in the palisades, we need people to swiftly, calmly, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4552.4400000000005s)]
*  and safely exit the area. Your PCs are pretty awesome. Okay. Okay. Head south. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4558.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a good information. Even my 40 90, which is like one of my most prized positions, I guess, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4564.679999999999s)]
*  technically is now completely worthless because of the new AI AI back technology that the Nvidia, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4570.2s)]
*  the new GPUs came out and made it worthless. Okay. So it doesn't even matter chatters. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4579.4s)]
*  We will very shortly have an interactive map that will depict the evacuation zone, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4586.28s)]
*  lafd.org slash news. Okay. Margaret Stewart. Thank you so much from LA city fire. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4592.5199999999995s)]
*  Wow. This is incredible. Now I'm sorry. I might need a little help. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4599.0s)]
*  Leave your dog. If you evacuate. Damn. That's crazy. I was planning on leaving her in this house fire. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4602.599999999999s)]
*  Thank you for letting me know not to leave literally the thing I care about as much as I [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4612.2s)]
*  care about my mom, basically. Thank you, chatter. Like I got my mom and I got Kaia. Okay. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4618.76s)]
*  You think I would, you think I would leave either of them behind? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4633.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, it's like telling me not to leave my mom in the fire. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4642.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's showing only once that and claiming that it's 40 90 is kind of laughable. See, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4648.76s)]
*  even in the process of all this, there's still a guy, there's still a tech nerd [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4655.0s)]
*  in the chapping like arm. We don't know out live on our air. Just seconds ago, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4658.52s)]
*  there is an immediate evacuation order for this entire swath of Hollywood and the Runyon Canyon [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4663.4800000000005s)]
*  area. This is happening fast. It's happening in real time. This fire has exploded and, and I mean, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4669.56s)]
*  it has exploded 10 fold, at least 10 fold in the last half hour. It is exploding as it makes [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4676.2s)]
*  its way towards the south, towards Hollywood. Fast. This fire has spread. And again, to reiterate [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4683.5599999999995s)]
*  Margaret Stewart saying that just take what you can, whatever you need immediately get out, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4690.2s)]
*  just take your medications and just get out of the, we've seen too many times people getting stuck [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4694.84s)]
*  in these canyons and then these windy streets and not being able to get out in time. Leave Marat. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4699.5599999999995s)]
*  Marat can take care of himself. Just a devastating with me. Marat is Marat is also [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4705.56s)]
*  literally a volunteer firefighter. He knows how to deal with this stuff better than I do. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4711.400000000001s)]
*  What take, what's your most valuable thing from home? I mean, your gold, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4718.84s)]
*  silver dollars, and you can go to the goddamn bunker. I am mother to go in the car. I don't [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4721.56s)]
*  have any of those things. Your guys are, you guys have a very different view of like the lifestyle [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4726.84s)]
*  that I lead. And blowing that fire directly into this neighborhood. The smoke is already covering [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4734.68s)]
*  up the neighborhood. The flames are not far behind it. Push in on Vista street, the end of Vista street [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4751.4800000000005s)]
*  right there at the end of the also you forget there's the Diddy tunnels, the actor bond that I [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4757.400000000001s)]
*  can escape to as a multi-billionaire, an incredibly famous person. All right. Well, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4762.36s)]
*  the largest fire is that on your left side of your screen is a shop from our downtown camera, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4774.44s)]
*  looking at the Runyon Canyon fire. I guess it's called the sunset fire now and just how fast that [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4779.08s)]
*  has grown. I am stunned by the speed we should expect it at this point. It shouldn't be shocking. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4784.2s)]
*  I can only, we can only be grateful that this is starting tonight and not last night when those [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4791.96s)]
*  winds were much, much faster. The things have tapered off, but they've only tapered off moderately [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4797.56s)]
*  guys. We are in a major fire danger until Friday. These winds are still blowing through here. And if [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4804.92s)]
*  you live in a flat area or if you even live in the San Fernando Valley or areas across the basin and [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4813.0s)]
*  you walk outside right now, it may not feel super windy. It may, you may feel the breeze, but dude, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4819.16s)]
*  I have, I have so much protein. I have so much protein and, and bottled water and like, you know, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4825.8s)]
*  just two pairs of undies. Okay. That's all I need. And also my backpacks, obviously the IRO backpacks [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4837.32s)]
*  were exceptional last night, but if you lived in the Hills, they were downright scary because it [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4849.24s)]
*  felt like an actual hurricane moving through the area in the middle of the night. Right now, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4854.68s)]
*  things have tapered off, but you can see the direction. Don't worry. Trouble come throw a [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4859.639999999999s)]
*  paper towel. Nice. In a lateral direction from the North to the South directly into the city of [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4863.88s)]
*  Hollywood. As I look out now, go ahead and wide out now, you can see a lot more traffic forming on [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4870.92s)]
*  Hollywood Boulevard to the right side. Lucas, you can see Hollywood Boulevard coming up. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4875.48s)]
*  They pictures are very expensive stuff for insurance. I don't have anything expensive [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4879.4s)]
*  starting to make their way through here, but I think they are kind of set for my car. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4882.679999999999s)]
*  Lookers that are trying to catch a glimpse because they're stunned, but about what they see is they [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4886.44s)]
*  look up into the hillside here. Those roads need to be used by evacuees and fire crews to get into [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4890.2s)]
*  this neighborhood and start fighting this fire somehow, some way. Yeah. On the best of days, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4895.639999999999s)]
*  those streets are crowded and congested anyway. So you should learn about auto-phagy and protein. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4900.6s)]
*  Maybe you learned that as long as the energy is adequate, protein is another way you've been [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4905.72s)]
*  brainwashed. I could, I could literally be on fire in the car driving away from the fire behind me. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4909.0s)]
*  And there would be a chatter being like, actually, I think you need to really reevaluate everything [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4918.68s)]
*  that you've learned about, you know, diets. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4924.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4930.6s)]
*  It's true. Shatters will never, you know what respect, dude, you're a lot less spend. And I [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4938.68s)]
*  thought to be honest, respect is on like, first of all, even if I had a bunch of expensive [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4944.92s)]
*  possessions, why would I tell you on stream list, but think [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4951.0s)]
*  about it. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4961.320000000001s)]
*  All right, Chris, if I had like a shit ton of expensive things, like if I had so many expensive [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4964.280000000001s)]
*  things, like why I spend all of my time in front of the camera, you would have seen it by now. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4972.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like people always talk about my jewelry. It's all it's nothing. You [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4980.04s)]
*  know what I mean? It's like this. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4984.200000000001s)]
*  Canyon. It's in this is Hollywood Boulevard right down here. Sorry about that. Let me move it up. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4990.6s)]
*  This is Hollywood. What about your clothes right along here? That is the south side of the [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=4996.84s)]
*  their clothes, man. So everything above it is being evacuated. Let me expand out a little bit [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5001.64s)]
*  more. We'll move it over a little bit more Laurel Canyon, which is right here. This is Laurel Canyon. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5007.08s)]
*  That is the western edge of the evacuation zone. So anything on this side of the Laurel Canyon. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5014.280000000001s)]
*  And then if we get to the top, Mulholland drive, which is right over here. So it's it's basically [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5020.04s)]
*  this area right here. So I know this is a little bit complicated, but let me just think that's the [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5026.2s)]
*  one of the best ways to not get robbed in general is just to not own anything of value. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5029.96s)]
*  Achilles drive, Willow Glen, and then Nichols Canyon, Waddles drive. And then all the way to [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5036.68s)]
*  We're fun though. If you had to save one piece of clothing, what would it be? I don't know. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5046.4400000000005s)]
*  So this whole strip of homes right here, look at all of these homes that you're talking about [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5049.4800000000005s)]
*  that should be evacuated. And if they haven't heard about the evacuation and you somebody lives there, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5055.88s)]
*  get a [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5060.68s)]
*  little bit of a [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5076.4400000000005s)]
*  line. My shit up, dude. I took the dreads out. My hairline is suffering. I need to line my shit up [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5092.4400000000005s)]
*  first. Okay. The fire can wait. All right. Got another notification from watch duty [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5100.68s)]
*  evacuation order level three, go Laurel Canyon Boulevard on the west of Mulholland drive on the [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5112.6s)]
*  north, the one-on-one freeway on the East down to Hollywood Boulevard on the South Los Angeles fire [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5117.400000000001s)]
*  department is officially sent a level three immediate evacuation order. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5122.52s)]
*  I know not for us, mom, for, you know, the area where [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5129.88s)]
*  it's it's far it's [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5145.88s)]
*  it's all right. I hope you never know, you know, when normally at night, the humidity goes up a [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5148.36s)]
*  little bit, but that is not happening in this situation. So this fire driven by terrain, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5160.759999999999s)]
*  of course, initially as Chris noted starts moving up the hillside, but then those winds come over [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5166.679999999999s)]
*  the top of the hills out of the north and northeast driving the fire toward the South. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5172.76s)]
*  Red flag warnings are going to stay with us. We look at the wind profiles right now. They're [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5177.96s)]
*  pretty much as we thought they would be this time yesterday. Lily Pichu is evacuated, but it's still [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5182.12s)]
*  a Santa Ana wind blowing through those Canyon passes. You can see Santa Clarita there at 25, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5187.8s)]
*  not 45. Thank goodness up in Pasadena. They dropped off to about 10 miles per hour in the city. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5192.84s)]
*  And of course, no wind down in the South may have any significance, but even in the Palisades, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5198.92s)]
*  we're getting 15 to occasional pulse winds up to about 30. Now where the winds are really howling [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5203.88s)]
*  tonight stronger because they're closer to that area of low pressure or out in the eye. Look at [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5210.76s)]
*  the winds being recorded right now out at San Bernardino. We saw, we watched this already [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5216.12s)]
*  their humidity 14%. Also through the can this is hell on earth. It's crazy. We still see winds [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5221.8s)]
*  up there 25, 35, even 45 miles per hour. Humidities again at about 10, 15%. Here's [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5228.12s)]
*  kind of an overall view of how dry the air can be. We don't know how this one started, Chad. We don't [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5235.4s)]
*  know. That's at Burbank airport. And as I mentioned, 8% up in the Canyon, really, really dry. Yeah, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5241.16s)]
*  this is when it first started 20 minutes ago for a Santa Ana wind blowing from the landmass, the [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5247.5599999999995s)]
*  continent out to sea. So you don't get any moisture from the ocean. There are a lot of people. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5253.96s)]
*  I'm going to tell you right now, a lot of people that you know, live in this area. Okay. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5261.4s)]
*  A lot of influencers that you know, live around this fire, like very close to this fire. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5265.24s)]
*  You will, you will, you know, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5270.6s)]
*  know. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5272.44s)]
*  And it looks like that's the sunset fire, the run in one. I hope I'm not in error about that, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5278.919999999999s)]
*  but it looks like that's the name they're giving it is the sunset fire, Chris. You are correct. It [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5284.2s)]
*  is now the sunset fire and it is getting closer and closer to this neighborhood along the street, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5289.0s)]
*  just north of Franklin Avenue, fire helicopters flying through the shot here. And I'm paying [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5294.839999999999s)]
*  particular attention to that monitoring actively. I'm not even in the secondary evac zone yet. Okay. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5299.8s)]
*  But that's a brand new spark that just happened a moment ago. That means those embers are indeed [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5306.4400000000005s)]
*  flying through the Canyon in the southerly direction. What's up, brother? How are you doing? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5313.0s)]
*  Boulevard. You got a leapfrog itself closer and closer to these homes. Fortunately at this juncture, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5316.84s)]
*  we have not seen any homes or structures touched, but we are mere minutes away unless they can put [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5324.4400000000005s)]
*  out that spot fire and kill the leading edge of this fire. And even that will only delay things [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5331.08s)]
*  because you have large flare-ups like the one near the top of your screen right there. See that big [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5337.24s)]
*  flare up right there guys. That is creating a huge amount of embers that are continuing to blow [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5341.56s)]
*  through here and continue to creep south towards Hollywood Boulevard. And you can see how fast that [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5346.92s)]
*  wind is going. You can see that smoke just going south very quickly. I know it's difficult to see [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5351.88s)]
*  because it's dark there, but how close to homes are you right now, Chris, when it comes to the flames? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5357.56s)]
*  No more than a hundred feet. No more than a hundred feet. They're less than a hundred feet [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5365.32s)]
*  if you live along Vista Street. If you live along Vista Street there, there are house lights in the [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5369.16s)]
*  shot and there is fire practically in the backyard. Okay. Right there. That's a new spot fire. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5373.32s)]
*  Literally in somebody's backyard, I think. As it continues to spot ahead of itself, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5381.56s)]
*  two spot fires. You see that tree on the left and a new tree or shrub or whatever on fire now on the [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5385.8s)]
*  right. Again, the embers are continuing to create new fires little by little by little. In fact, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5391.88s)]
*  is there a flame on Vista? Is that a headlight or is that a city that there might be a house light? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5397.96s)]
*  Okay, that's just a house light. But you can get an idea of the proximity to those houses now [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5402.52s)]
*  that this fire is getting closer and closer. Chris, traffic wise, are you seeing any kind of [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5407.08s)]
*  strings of cars trying to get out of there or I worry the word is not getting out that they need [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5413.0s)]
*  to leave? I worry about the same thing, David. I don't see any traffic coming from this neighborhood. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5418.28s)]
*  Hollywood Boulevard is now suddenly coming to a standstill and you can see why because basically [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5424.92s)]
*  people are catching wind of what's going on here. They're driving through Hollywood and all of a [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5430.44s)]
*  sudden they're in a cloud of smoke and catching a glimpse of the bright fire up on the hillside [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5434.68s)]
*  here. So that's Hollywood Boulevard on the right hand side of your screen. Lots of brake lights, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5440.200000000001s)]
*  lots of headlights as fire crews try and make their way through here. The one good thing here [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5444.280000000001s)]
*  is that we're seeing more helicopters arrive on scene and we are seeing more water drops. But look [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5449.96s)]
*  at all those flashing lights. Those are all fire trucks making their way into the neighborhood [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5454.52s)]
*  and hopefully getting into position. I presume even though it's dark and we can't see this very [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5459.240000000001s)]
*  clearly, I presume they're already in the process of trying to set up for structure protection [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5463.8s)]
*  in the neighborhood just north of Hollywood Boulevard. Now the evacuation order, as I [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5469.16s)]
*  understand it, extends to the south up to Hollywood Boulevard. That's for now. If this neighborhood [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5474.76s)]
*  catches on fire, expect that to grow and I mean if this becomes an urban fire in the middle of [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5482.04s)]
*  Hollywood, you know, God help us. But this evacuation area could grow and it could grow [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5487.56s)]
*  in short order like within the hour. So let's keep a close eye on this and see how they do protecting [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5495.0s)]
*  these homes right here. But once these embers start flying into that neighborhood right there [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5500.52s)]
*  between Sierra Bonita Avenue, Hillside Avenue and Vista Street along Franklin Avenue just north of [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5505.080000000001s)]
*  Hollywood Boulevard, then we have real problems. We'll see. It's getting closer by the minute. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5511.080000000001s)]
*  Showing on the left side of the screen the traffic on Hollywood Boulevard and you can see the palm [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5515.56s)]
*  trees there really blowing there. So we could give you just an indication of those winds are still [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5519.320000000001s)]
*  very strong. We do have a point of origin that CAL FIRE is talking about. It's a 2,300 block of [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5523.8s)]
*  solar drive in Hollywood Hills and that acreage right now they're saying 19.8 of course it's been [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5529.080000000001s)]
*  growing as we watch. So it's more than that of course. And Ellen, I have actually a new spot [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5534.360000000001s)]
*  fire right there right there in the middle of your screen. A new spot fire getting closer to Runyon [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5540.200000000001s)]
*  Canyon where fire crews are now manning Runyon Canyon Road. There's a new fire right there that's [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5544.52s)]
*  grown pretty quickly and is now getting closer to Runyon Canyon. What I'm looking for guys is for [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5550.4400000000005s)]
*  that fire to jump Runyon Canyon Road based on the direction of the winds here. The winds are blowing [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5556.120000000001s)]
*  that smoke and fire in this direction towards our shot here and we will see if they keep this fire [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5561.8s)]
*  from jumping Runyon Canyon Road. But it's going to be very difficult with those embers flying [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5567.72s)]
*  through the air. Right okay so we know where this fire at least was reported. This is Solar Drive [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5571.32s)]
*  right here. This one street I'm going to expand it out a little bit further and the reason why [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5578.44s)]
*  I'm showing you that the point of origin 2,300 solar drive that could have been where they [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5583.799999999999s)]
*  somebody spotted it and reported it or it could have been where it started. But this is Solar Drive [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5588.36s)]
*  okay. So now I'm going to kind of push out you a better idea. So this is the point of origin [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5592.92s)]
*  and then we're showing this fire went all the way down this canyon and now all of this is on fire [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5598.52s)]
*  as Chris was just saying. Runyon Canyon is in trouble right over here. All of this is now on [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5605.64s)]
*  fire and this is a matter of minutes we're talking about as it continues to go in this direction [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5611.56s)]
*  south. So for some reason it started right there. Ellen I'm going to throw it back to you. All right [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5617.160000000001s)]
*  we got to tell everybody that we're going to stay on the air here on KBC 7 or ABC 7 and not go to [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5621.080000000001s)]
*  world news tonight with David Muir because of the nature of this breaking news. So you can stick [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5626.68s)]
*  around and we'll find out more about this fire that is rapidly growing and so we want to keep [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5630.92s)]
*  a close eye on this of course. All right Ellen thanks and we're going to stay on top of our [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5634.280000000001s)]
*  coverage digitally. On the air until seven. On the air until seven. Even that's growing. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5639.88s)]
*  Continue and let's throw it back over to Chris Christie with more as this fire continues to [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5646.6s)]
*  spread towards Runyon Canyon Drive. Yeah and unfortunately the further the fire continues to [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5651.72s)]
*  spread southward so does that smoke and you can already see it more and more by the minute. A lot [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5657.72s)]
*  of that thick black smoke now drifting right over the the Hollywood area. This entire area is now [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5662.84s)]
*  being blanketed by really thick and unhealthy smoke. Obviously it is time to get out if you live [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5669.4800000000005s)]
*  anywhere in this area. You could take a look at Hollywood Boulevard along the left side of your [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5676.52s)]
*  screen here. Lots of traffic starting to build up there and even on Franklin Avenue as those are [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5680.92s)]
*  more than likely evacuees. Those are probably folks already trying to get out of here. Yes some of it [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5686.28s)]
*  is passed through traffic. Some people use Franklin Avenue as a shortcut through Hollywood. It's [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5693.16s)]
*  complete gridlock already but you can see traffic up and down Franklin Avenue is now bumper to [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5697.16s)]
*  bumper as folks try and flee away from this fire. Camino, Palmaro Street and Franklin Avenue is the [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5703.0s)]
*  closest major intersection to this fire. Vista Street is the closest known residential street [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5710.2s)]
*  to this fire and I actually see a little bit of a flare-up on the other side as well. Go ahead and [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5716.28s)]
*  widen out for me Lucas. Widen out and push into the top right hand corner now of the fire. That's [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5723.5599999999995s)]
*  going to be the end of Carson Avenue where I want to focus just for a second to see if there's any [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5729.08s)]
*  structures that are being threatened here. We're going to come around here. You can see some of the [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5735.08s)]
*  houses at the end of the neighborhood we've been talking about here. We're going to get a better [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5738.84s)]
*  glimpse as we come around the north side. So now we're on the north side of the fire on the San [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5743.0s)]
*  Fernando Valley side over Mulholland Drive looking south with the fire and wind blowing away from [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5747.8s)]
*  Air 7 and right along the right side as we come around this ridgeline you're going to see [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5753.88s)]
*  Carson Avenue and we'll see if there's any sign whatsoever. It looks like the wind is actually [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5758.68s)]
*  helping these folks. It's reaching the top of the ridge line right there and then it would have to [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5765.4s)]
*  go downhill which is not convenient for the fire right? Everything's blowing in the other direction [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5771.0s)]
*  and fire likes to go uphill. So the folks along Carson Avenue have the luxury of being below [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5775.5599999999995s)]
*  the fire instead of above the fire. So Carson Avenue on the right there is down the hill from that. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5781.879999999999s)]
*  Did Will make it to my house? No you would see him if he made it to my house. He's literally stuck in [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5787.48s)]
*  traffic right now. He's stuck in a goddamn jam as these fires are getting closer and closer to their [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5792.44s)]
*  place. From somebody's backyard go ahead and widen out a little bit you can see a home right [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5799.4s)]
*  there. Let's go ahead and throw up our go ahead and throw me the parcel show me the parcel Lucas. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5805.32s)]
*  We want to get some addresses out there. It's going to be Hollywood is of course bumper to [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5812.2s)]
*  bumper look at this. Carson Avenue here along the 2000 block of Carson you can see the home [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5815.96s)]
*  1984 Carson Avenue with fire. FaceTime him for some content? No I'm not going to do that you freak. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5821.88s)]
*  Okay so I've been able to isolate Carson Avenue here on our touch screen as well. You can see [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5829.4800000000005s)]
*  where the fire is burning and this candy to here. This is Carson. This is the street that Chris is [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5834.36s)]
*  talking about and you can see all the sizable homes that are along Carson Avenue as the fire [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5839.96s)]
*  continues to creep towards these homes right here. These are the ones in imminent danger right now [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5845.24s)]
*  but as that fire rolls in different directions of course danger as well as you can see highly [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5850.84s)]
*  populated the further the fire goes down the canyon the more homes that are going to be in [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5856.12s)]
*  trouble. Chris I'm going to throw it back to you as you watch as far as progress. Yeah we're going [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5861.24s)]
*  to continue to kind of wrap ourselves around this watching it spot not only to the south now but also [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5865.5599999999995s)]
*  spotting a little bit over towards the west so we're going to keep an eye on Carson Avenue [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5871.24s)]
*  but I think the focus here still remains on Hillside Avenue, Vista Street and Franklin Avenue [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5875.24s)]
*  right there that neighborhood on the right is now under threat by that fire. What is this? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5881.639999999999s)]
*  Okay of course man of course. Oh yeah see the camera bro. There is no way he's doing a [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5887.16s)]
*  meeting right now. Are you serious? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5897.4s)]
*  All right bro. I'll see you. Take care brother. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5901.719999999999s)]
*  Where is he? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5906.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah yeah my house is burning down. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5913.0s)]
*  Bro oh he's in okay he's he's fine because he's not near the fire his house is near the fire. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5914.36s)]
*  Okay I was worried I thought he was like it didn't look like he's passing out flyers for his concert. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5933.32s)]
*  Phase boys are still in the house. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5939.64s)]
*  Yeah he's he's passing out flyers for his concert but that's the fire that is on the move very very [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5945.240000000001s)]
*  quickly a brand new fire and they're trying to get as many resources on that as possible. Yeah [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5951.88s)]
*  this is one of those areas that we know would be prone during these kind of storm events but again [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5955.88s)]
*  this area is so highly populated I'm curious to see when we're going to start seeing that mass [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5961.4800000000005s)]
*  exodus trying to get down Laurel Canyon or during in the Coanga neighborhood area where they have [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5966.04s)]
*  to get down because there's really only two arteries outside of this area they're going to [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5971.32s)]
*  have to go Laurel Canyon or they're going to have to go down to get to Coanga but again this is one [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5976.04s)]
*  of those areas that there are so many homes dotted along this area this is exactly what none of these [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5981.72s)]
*  homeowners want to see but again at least it's right now in the brush and we do know that LA [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5988.04s)]
*  county fire they've also been asked to join in this firefight but again you can see this [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=5993.88s)]
*  thank goodness the winds seem like they're slightly calmed down compared to what we were seeing [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6000.2s)]
*  hours earlier when you know the flames would start and then they would be horizontal. I already have [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6005.72s)]
*  all my important things packed up I have a passport and and protein and water I'm not sure again I [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6010.6s)]
*  know you've noticed earlier to see and also a bunch of batteries making their way through this [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6019.4s)]
*  area I'm I'm just curious because we know how heavily populated this area is I don't see a [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6025.24s)]
*  huge amount of traffic or maybe just so high up don't forget the zens yeah I mean the zens are [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6031.96s)]
*  right here bro if there were 80 mile winds right now I'd be a little bit more worried about my [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6037.24s)]
*  situation I'm still worried about my friends that are near the fire and trying to leave [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6043.96s)]
*  all my friends are texting me like bro are we are we cooked are we dead are we are we gone what's [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6058.68s)]
*  happening? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6063.56s)]
*  that's a good sign right there those are folks along Camino Palmero street that are I can't wait [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6073.96s)]
*  for the way most of malfunction in the middle of all of this and create massive traffic jams by the [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6078.6s)]
*  way get ready for those situations to occur too everybody told me who's on you're wrong waymos are [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6085.4800000000005s)]
*  sick waymos of future guess what dude you're way more likely to experience traffic jams when you [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6093.32s)]
*  got artificial intelligence robots on the freaking roads [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6101.32s)]
*  don't bring that into existence is called foresight [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6106.92s)]
*  what we're talking about now I'm going to expand out the color is going to go away [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6114.76s)]
*  so you can more clearly see the homes that are in trouble and as we expand out this is where the [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6118.28s)]
*  fire is and then you see outpost you see runyon canyon right here nickels canyon right over here [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6123.72s)]
*  jupiter drive and hercules right over here all of that if you live in this area you need to get out [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6132.52s)]
*  willow glen carmen crest coanga boulevard even parts of coanga boulevard are being evacuated [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6138.76s)]
*  but the fire is heading in this direction towards hollywood this being hollywood boulevard and as [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6146.76s)]
*  I'm going to expand out again and you can see the tremendous amount of people that live and work [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6153.0s)]
*  right here in hollywood boulevard this is where the fire department is staging structure protection [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6158.92s)]
*  right now and trying to get as many people or units involved in this firefight as possible now [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6163.88s)]
*  let me point this out because I'm getting some texts and emails as I'm going to shrink it a [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6170.04s)]
*  little bit this is the fire area we're talking about now if you live north like towards the [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6174.84s)]
*  valley here towards to look alike towards burbank you're okay because a fire is going in this [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6180.36s)]
*  direction it's not going north it's this area south of the fire that is in trouble the the hills [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6185.88s)]
*  right now of hollywood and just south of the hills that's the area that we're most concerned with [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6192.44s)]
*  right now as this firefight is well underway uh colina throw it back over to you yeah david we're [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6198.5199999999995s)]
*  taking a very good look at that map is really really helpful to kind of give an idea of where [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6204.839999999999s)]
*  this fire is located because we know the hollywood hills they are very very congested and that's the [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6210.04s)]
*  luxury and the wonderful thing about living in the hollywood hills you can see hollywood boulevard [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6216.68s)]
*  right there you can see all those cars it seems like you know fire officials have been saying [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6220.68s)]
*  please stay off the roads unless you need to be on the roads and this is one of the reasons why [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6225.88s)]
*  you never know where a fire could pop up and then you have evacuees trying to get out as quickly as [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6230.5199999999995s)]
*  possible i'm not sure how many people in this area decided to be proactive and get their ready set go [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6238.04s)]
*  plan in place but again this is one of those areas where i'm always concerned about i know many of us [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6245.4s)]
*  have lived in these areas a lot of us currently live in this this area it's very close to everything [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6252.92s)]
*  and that's why this area is very congested with a lot of homes but again runyon canyon we all we all [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6259.24s)]
*  enjoy runyon canyon and you can see runyon canyon right there is is on fire and it's been it's [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6265.16s)]
*  wonderful to see the air support allowed to help in this firefight this evening because we were [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6272.44s)]
*  not so fortunate last night to have air support and yes chris actually we do see your sky map on [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6278.2s)]
*  which is great to see i i know i can hear you ever so slightly chris but these are these are some of [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6285.24s)]
*  the evacuation now underway because of this sunset fire we just want to highlight some key areas [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6292.52s)]
*  if you live near laurel canyon boulevard to the 101 freeway moholland drive to hollywood boulevard [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6298.84s)]
*  those are the borders of the evacuation zone it's largely around the canyons up in the hills and [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6305.400000000001s)]
*  then south towards hollywood boulevard that's the area we're talking about if you live um yeah in [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6311.160000000001s)]
*  those hills particularly that's where there's a lot of fuel and that's where this fire broke out and [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6317.160000000001s)]
*  it's it's consuming property really really quickly although if we can check back in with chris chris [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6321.96s)]
*  to this moment though you haven't seen any buildings on fire yet no buildings that we have observed [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6329.16s)]
*  but there are now two major flare-ups there's one in the foreground here right there in the center of [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6335.4s)]
*  your screen and if you tilt up just a little bit lucas you can see on the other side of the ridge [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6339.96s)]
*  line there's another flare-up on the back side on the other side of that ridge line those tall [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6343.64s)]
*  flames are what really create the most danger because that is creating embers that are already [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6349.56s)]
*  flying at a higher altitude than you know low uh you know lower shrubbery and things like that [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6356.04s)]
*  so you have really tall flames starting to flare up as the fire encounters some thicker brush [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6363.400000000001s)]
*  hopefully these people have some degree of brush clearance but in these winds it really doesn't [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6368.04s)]
*  matter i can only say that again thankfully if this was 24 hours ago we would already be in trouble [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6373.240000000001s)]
*  now they have a little bit a little bit more time to prepare to get out and the fire department [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6378.84s)]
*  has a little bit more time to try and get in front of it but it is a wait and see game at this hour [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6383.24s)]
*  yeah absolutely chris we're we are going to be talking on the phone with phil mercado phil [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6389.16s)]
*  we understand you are being evacuated right now where do you live in this area that is in the [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6396.28s)]
*  evacuation zone we are just off of curzon avenue north of hollywood boulevard how did you find out [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6402.28s)]
*  about this this and how quickly did you have to react um well the crazy thing is i my husband and [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6410.36s)]
*  i have three kids and i was out with two of them and we were on our way home and a friend over in [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6417.8s)]
*  nickels canyon called us and asked if we got the warning to evacuate because she saw fire on the [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6423.32s)]
*  hill across and so i called my husband and our son who they heard some helicopters but they thought [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6430.84s)]
*  it was la they didn't think anything of it and i told them that they had to evacuate yeah and were [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6439.96s)]
*  you at all when you saw the santa ana wind event about to happen over the last few days of monitoring [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6448.2s)]
*  did you at all put together a ready set go plan or have any bag or anything or is this one of those [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6454.92s)]
*  things where you know many of us live in this community and then you kind of just hope that [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6461.4s)]
*  nothing happens it was a little bit of both you know we we just knew that we needed you know [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6466.599999999999s)]
*  laptops and and phones and some personal stuff that we kind of had at the ready and we backed all of [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6472.599999999999s)]
*  our cars in in case we had to make a speedy exit and you know i thought actually through the evening [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6479.88s)]
*  we would probably have to do it just because the winds were so crazy but luckily nothing happened [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6488.52s)]
*  last night and unfortunately now it's happening yeah yeah and this is a brand spanking new fire [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6492.68s)]
*  that we were hoping wouldn't happen we have enough to deal with obviously when i'm assuming you then [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6498.36s)]
*  got out and you're safe right now and what was that experience like getting out did you run into [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6504.84s)]
*  traffic is the rest of your community responding yeah so you know we're all on a good community [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6510.04s)]
*  whatsapp up here in croissant canyon and everybody it was just basically blowing up and telling [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6516.4400000000005s)]

*  weather as well it seems like the winds really did pick up i mean this afternoon things seem to [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6609.56s)]
*  calm down and then the moment the sun was starting to set it came up and it's pretty windy right now [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6614.68s)]
*  and chilly and how are your kids responding right now being uh they're they're resilient teens and [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6619.8s)]

*  there was a small fire up above us years ago but easily contained nothing like this well well um [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6659.72s)]
*  i'm sure there's a lifelong memories in that home hopefully you'll stay safe phil bercardo thank you [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6666.2s)]
*  i'm not going to chat if i go pick up will perfect have a great night and caroline i'm not going to [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6670.92s)]
*  pick them up from their house where obviously i can't go there because they can't get out of [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6677.08s)]
*  there going on right now and i'm going to pick them up from the those winds and how powerful they are [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6681.56s)]
*  if i do go pick them up i'm gonna go pick them up from the good news is they they eventually will [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6686.44s)]
*  right now like a place where they're walking set up here are where the producer phil will [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6690.679999999999s)]
*  been really keeping an eye on these things for us so the hollywood fire here's the one we're [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6694.44s)]
*  talking about right now at the moment we're seeing the the wind still in that double digit range [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6697.32s)]
*  although in the lower end of that 11 10 miles per hour through the next few hours tonight [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6701.4s)]
*  we head towards midnight now we're knocking it down to single digits four two miles per hour these [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6705.4s)]
*  are those those winds that kind of come through with those gusts that come up those are the ones [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6709.4s)]
*  you really worry about as chris chris he's been showing us that fire can move very quickly because [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6713.24s)]
*  those winds the gusts pick up grab those embers and move them to other spots and start yet another [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6717.16s)]
*  fire these spot fires that go so we're seeing that going on that way so for example we're [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6722.12s)]
*  showing you the wind showing up right here around that area we're seeing the northeast winds 15 [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6725.88s)]
*  miles per hour again that double digit range i told you and then the gusts that show up in that [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6729.96s)]
*  25 mile per hour range and you can see right there there's that hollywood highland area the much [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6733.639999999999s)]
*  populated hollywood area so that's going to be an area of concern to watch out for so there's that [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6737.88s)]
*  fire zone as we've been showing you there's those winds going from that north northeast profile and [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6742.12s)]
*  that true santa ana look that pushes everything towards the south and southwest right towards that [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6746.68s)]
*  very very populated area here so we're seeing that's why the major concern is this thing is [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6752.44s)]
*  essentially doubled in size when chris first found that it's like 10 acres or so now i think [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6757.4s)]
*  we're pushing around that 20 acre range so we're still seeing that and then there again the palestin [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6762.5199999999995s)]
*  fire same kind of idea again those winds come on the north northeast blowing towards the south [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6766.44s)]
*  there too the winds are quite strong the hearse fire also 20 mile per hour winds with those heavier [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6770.76s)]
*  gusts as well so we're seeing those fires all still very active and still very concerned hence [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6775.56s)]
*  that red flag worn in effect now until friday in most spots so david colleen we're seeing more of [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6780.04s)]
*  this and we're tracking it continuously throughout the night time of course absolutely thank you very [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6785.4800000000005s)]
*  much danny let's talk about our team of eyewitness news reporters they are fanning out following [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6789.8s)]
*  these fires let's go to tim caputo tim you are in hollywood where exactly are you located obviously [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6794.04s)]
*  we see a lot of cars behind you by the way there is an eight second delay for tim so bear with us [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6800.04s)]
*  while we throw to him and he'll he'll kick it in in just a few seconds go ahead tim yes [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6804.6s)]
*  yeah cell phone service has been spotty especially in the hardest hit areas we're on franklin avenue [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6816.36s)]
*  if you know this area you know this street gets particularly busy but nothing quite like this [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6820.84s)]
*  because of the evacuations this road is absolutely smacked with cars practically in every direction [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6825.16s)]
*  as we were coming in from the glendale area you could barely get up the street here and now you [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6830.12s)]
*  have all these cars heading out and you could see why over my shoulder there we're obviously on the [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6836.2s)]
*  ground level and looking up into ronion canyon canyon you could see the smoke obviously and the [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6840.2s)]
*  fire glow in the night sky right now and obviously from this vantage point a whole lot of people are [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6846.04s)]
*  seeing that and figuring out where to go from here we actually spoke with a young man just maybe [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6851.64s)]
*  two minutes ago coming down the stairs of this apartment with two suitcases and a couple backpacks [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6856.280000000001s)]
*  and he said i got the evacuation and i just had to get out of here didn't even really have a plan [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6861.0s)]
*  from this point he just figured he needed to get away from here obviously folks who've been watching [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6865.240000000001s)]
*  for the last two days or so seeing the palisades seeing altadena pasadena not really thinking oh [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6869.72s)]
*  we're in harm's way everything changed in an instant in the last 20 30 minutes hours so as you [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6876.04s)]
*  see behind me that seems to be coming down the canyon now the wind is obviously blowing it away [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6881.24s)]
*  from where we are right now we're at outpost kind of near sycamore outpost goes all the way up to [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6886.2s)]
*  mullholland you can get to kind of where that fire is but it seems to be moving in a more kind of west [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6891.0s)]
*  direction so this particular area might not be specifically at risk but i'll tell you for the [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6896.28s)]
*  folks who are grabbing their luggage for the folks who are getting in their cars they don't care if [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6901.32s)]
*  it's a little bit that way because if this is even remotely at risk they are getting out of this area [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6905.24s)]
*  and you see behind me all this traffic coming up and down the street a lot of these folks in there [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6910.52s)]
*  are hotels over here as well we've seen a handful of people grabbing all their luggage one guy told [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6914.280000000001s)]
*  me he was checking out early because he just needed to get out of here and rightfully so [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6919.56s)]
*  we'll look to the left here in front of the hotel you have a number of people who are kind of grabbing [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6923.64s)]
*  their luggage grabbing their things and leaving here as we look down franklin towards highland [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6927.88s)]
*  it is completely packed with cars trying to get out of here that's why you're even seeing cars [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6933.88s)]
*  essentially take every single route they can out of here because if you're trying to get to highland [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6937.5599999999995s)]
*  to get out of dodge that way it is packed it is slow moving so we have all these people essentially [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6941.639999999999s)]
*  trying to get out of here because of the fire and even if you're not looking right at the fire [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6946.5199999999995s)]
*  you could actually see the glow coming off the smoke as you look up into ronion canyon and if [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6950.28s)]
*  you know the area as well it's not just homes here well there are a lot of homes as you get up into [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6956.2s)]
*  the hills these are a lot of apartments meaning it's an awful lot of people so once they get in [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6960.28s)]
*  their cars and they start moving out of here you have this big influx of people getting into their [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6965.24s)]
*  vehicles and trying to leave and that's why you have all these traffic jams here in hollywood of [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6969.639999999999s)]
*  people trying to get essentially any direction away from ronion canyon it is slow moving but [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6974.04s)]
*  certainly people grabbing their things and going they're heating those warnings they're doing it [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6979.08s)]
*  early but it's obviously going to take a long time for those folks all right tim thank you [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6982.599999999999s)]
*  monitor the situation a lot is going on and we want to check back with you because that is [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6989.48s)]
*  tremendous that traffic to get out of there i'm worried about the gridlock and folks eventually [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6993.72s)]
*  panicking we don't know we don't want to happen today what happened yesterday when folks just [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=6997.96s)]
*  decided to leave their cars that would be a disaster especially in hollywood monitor the [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7002.76s)]
*  situation we'll get back to you one quick note we might have noted said this evacuation zones have [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7006.84s)]
*  been issued is canceling all classes no we're not even in the secondary evacuation zone because of [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7011.8s)]
*  the fire danger throughout so evacuation zones have been issued so if you have a child in the [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7016.84s)]
*  secondary evacuation zones have expanded school tomorrow and they are waiting they will determine [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7021.32s)]
*  tomorrow on whether or not you're going to go to class on friday in the meantime we do have [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7026.84s)]

*  um so it is a very scary situation here we have been prepared to evacuate you know for the last [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7053.72s)]
*  hour or two and we also have a couple of people to try to water down the roof of the castle [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7059.8s)]
*  and and you know the fire is definitely fast moving fire and we are very worried that it's [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7067.64s)]
*  going all direction um we can tell that it's very close maybe like a mile or so um if i if i see [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7074.04s)]

*  on the westerdina we decided to close the castle earlier today and make sure everyone the staff [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7098.92s)]
*  specifically to be safe and we thought we closed down and we don't you know we we left the castle [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7105.88s)]
*  sometime this afternoon and we find out later on that we had a new fire popping by so it was [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7114.120000000001s)]
*  definitely unfortunate but you know it was definitely fortunate that the castle was already [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7120.52s)]
*  closed i'm amazed that you guys already closed it um so you have people there right now trying [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7124.6s)]
*  to put some water on the castle what's the status of that situation right now from people who you [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7130.280000000001s)]

*  sure that we get enough moisture on the roof but also on the greenery around the castle [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7152.04s)]
*  obviously you know with the evacuation process we don't want to stay too long and [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7159.639999999999s)]
*  and um and i'm going to be asking the the staff to move very soon but we wanted to make sure that [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADYndPy3NxY&t=7163.88s)]
