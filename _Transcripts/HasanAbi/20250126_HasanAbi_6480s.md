**HasanAbi:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s)
*  I told them biceps and triceps. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, biceps and triceps. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2.0s)]
*  I'm doing biceps, triceps, and shoulders. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=3.0s)]
*  Slow it down, slow it down. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6.0s)]

*  There we go. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=8.0s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=9.0s)]
*  Focus. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=10.0s)]
*  Focus. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=11.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=12.0s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=13.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=14.0s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=15.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=17.0s)]
*  On the eccentric. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=18.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=19.0s)]
*  Fired? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=20.0s)]
*  Some people are calling it the Mr. Politic 127 meltdown. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=28.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  First of all. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, guys, make sure you prime sub or gift subs because both of his cards [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  got declined last night. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=44.16s)]
*  So I don't know what's going on in his life, but. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=45.44s)]
*  The money's really dried up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=49.8s)]
*  It's not a good situation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Be like a gambling addiction perhaps. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=56.64s)]
*  So we feed him like a Bengal tiger. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=57.64s)]
*  So we have a thousand dollar a day meat fund because he can't eat anything but just a side [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=58.64s)]
*  of beef apparently. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=65.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=66.84s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=67.84s)]
*  Tell them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=68.84s)]
*  Tell them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=69.84s)]
*  Last night we went to a Shabu Shabu place. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=70.84s)]
*  Now for those of you who don't know, unless you're, you know, might not be fluent in Japanese [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=73.16s)]
*  like me or Marge. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=78.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=80.04s)]
*  But Shabu Shabu means Swiss Swiss. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=81.04s)]
*  So. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=83.0s)]
*  Swiss Swiss. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=84.0s)]
*  Swiss Swiss. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=85.04s)]
*  Now it's a fantastic way to consume meat. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=86.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=91.04s)]
*  Meat being the key ingredient of a beautiful Shabu Shabu meal. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=92.04s)]
*  So I of course suspected us to eat a bunch of decadent meats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=95.8s)]
*  Much to my surprise, March, I believe, ordered specifically the seafood fleet. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=103.2s)]
*  Until the main course. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=112.12s)]
*  What is roughly translated to the uni canon? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  The uni canon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=116.08s)]
*  The the fishiest. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  I think he he was probably trying to say no fish for me, please. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  But because he's not the most fluent, like he hasn't spoken Japanese for a while. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=123.48s)]
*  How is this my fault? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=126.92s)]
*  He ended up ordering the most fishiest. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=127.92s)]
*  Also somehow in the attempt to order water, we ordered two bottles of vodka. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=136.28s)]
*  Oh, that was that was a bit Austin bit March where. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=137.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  I ordered vodka and I ordered water and they combine the two into vodka water. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=141.72s)]
*  They did. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=144.28s)]
*  They did do that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=145.28s)]
*  And it took it took them like a like a weird weirdly long time to to actually give us like [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=146.28s)]
*  normal water to drink. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=154.16s)]
*  Two minutes out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  We have a van. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  Now of course, I was very hungry at the end of this process. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  And as a hungry boy, as you guys know, I don't really eat a lot of protein. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=163.76s)]
*  I thought this was an opportunity to consume protein. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=167.04s)]
*  What you said, what it's like we like feeding a Bengal tiger. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=170.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mentioned that too. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=174.04s)]
*  So what ended up happening is maybe I was still a little hungry by the end of the the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=176.68s)]
*  you know, last round of meat. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=183.6s)]
*  So I said, Motto Motto me too. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=185.3s)]
*  So they did. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=189.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=190.04s)]
*  You're forgetting a key part where you found the translation for no more seafood. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=191.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=195.52s)]
*  Translate and he just kept pressing play over and over again. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  Will had to physically stop me from saying it out loud in the vicinity of one of the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=202.8s)]
*  old ladies who did not speak a lick of English. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=207.84s)]
*  Horrified. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=211.84s)]
*  And yeah, we ordered extra meat, not realizing that the meats were around a thousand dollars. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  No, he told you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=220.28s)]
*  Well, I was really hungry, so I didn't really care. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=222.12s)]
*  So since the beginning of this trip, I have kind of been making will foot the bill. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=226.52s)]
*  Okay, uncharacteristic of me. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  I know I thought, you know, I'll pay for this and pay for it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=234.12s)]
*  I did. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=238.72s)]
*  Or at least I thought I would. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=239.72s)]
*  Will ended the will end of the stream. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=243.12s)]
*  I went out there and the lady came back to me and said, hey, there's been an issue with [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  your card. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=249.72s)]
*  So I went out there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=250.72s)]
*  I was like, oh, it's a debit card. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=251.72s)]
*  I tried to pay with both of my cards, neither of which worked. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=253.96s)]
*  So I had to go back and get Will to pay for the meal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  Now it's time for the real version of the story. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=263.36s)]
*  Hassan takes us out and he goes, listen, I wants what I wants and I's going to get it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=266.04s)]
*  And then we were like, we'd like some seafood. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=274.56s)]
*  And he said, shut up, fucking peasants. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  And he started smashing the table, screaming. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=278.88s)]
*  And then he orders sides of meat. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=281.86s)]
*  Side of, Marsh goes, Hassan, that's thousands of dollars of meat. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=285.14s)]
*  He said, I don't care. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm Mr. Politic 127. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=289.66s)]
*  And at the end of the meal, he handed the, our attendant his wooden room card. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=291.26s)]
*  And I looked at him and I said, Hassan, that's not your credit card. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  And he said, that's Praxis, bitch. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=302.06s)]
*  Get ready to pay. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=304.76s)]
*  We were all very scared and upset of Mr. Politic 127. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=306.76s)]
*  Also, I have another awful thing to tell you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  I stole Hassan a little bit. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=317.26s)]
*  He put the overlay. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=319.46s)]
*  I placed the overlay. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=322.06s)]
*  I hope it works. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=323.36s)]
*  We shall see if it works or not. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=325.96s)]
*  He wanted to test it out before we actually left, but I didn't put the overlay on the desk. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=328.96s)]
*  He steals my content ideas, my money, my producers. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  This is... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=337.86s)]
*  So we'll see if it works. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=338.86s)]
*  I'm very excited though. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=340.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=346.36s)]
*  Where the heck is this? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=347.06s)]
*  I'm cold as hell, man. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=348.26s)]
*  And I got hella layers. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=349.76s)]
*  I'm layered the freak up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=351.66s)]
*  Are you going to work out? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=352.86s)]
*  Everyone is jealous of my gut. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=353.76s)]
*  I mean, below this, I've got the ability to work out. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=355.06s)]
*  Let me just take this off. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=357.76s)]
*  It's like enough. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=359.36s)]
*  It's like workout adjacent stuff. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=360.26s)]
*  So we're not doing a serious workout then? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=361.76s)]
*  No. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=363.36s)]
*  I mean, are you... [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=363.86s)]
*  Well, look at you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=364.46s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=365.26s)]

*  What's up, guys? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=506.86s)]
*  Today, we are going to the One Piece Gym in the heart of Shibuya in Tokyo, Japan. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=507.86s)]
*  As you guys know, I'm a massive fan of Mugiwara. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=514.86s)]
*  And I'm very excited to go and see the One Piece fans that unite all around the world [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=517.86s)]
*  to come to what they are calling the second Mecca, maybe the Medina of lifting the church. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=527.86s)]
*  Lifting the church of iron. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=535.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=537.86s)]
*  We're going to the One Piece Gym. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=538.86s)]
*  Now, I'm going to the One Piece Gym with my friends who either don't know what One Piece is, Austin, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=540.86s)]
*  who doesn't watch anime and ask the question, what is a manga? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=548.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=552.86s)]
*  Yesterday. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=553.86s)]
*  Or Will, who is even worse, he hates One Piece. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=554.86s)]
*  I don't hate One Piece. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=558.86s)]
*  Okay, we're going with Will who does not like One Piece. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=560.86s)]
*  Would that be a fair estimation? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=563.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=566.86s)]
*  Christian, you don't fuck with anime either, do you? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=567.86s)]
*  I'm not an avid fan. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=571.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=573.86s)]
*  So I'm the only one who likes One Piece. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=575.86s)]
*  Marge has never seen it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=577.86s)]
*  I also don't like it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=579.86s)]
*  But he likes the fans, I think. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=580.86s)]
*  Right, Marge? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=583.86s)]
*  No, I hate it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=585.86s)]
*  Marge is going to pick up One Piece. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=587.86s)]
*  So I actually, I do have to say something in my defense. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=589.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=592.86s)]
*  I have been watching One Piece. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=593.86s)]
*  And I started by watching 50 episodes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=595.86s)]
*  And I said, this show really is, I don't get it, it's kind of midline. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=600.86s)]
*  And the fans said, watch to episode 100. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=605.86s)]
*  So I watched episode 100. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=609.86s)]
*  And then I reassessed and I thought to myself, this show really isn't that good. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=611.86s)]
*  So the fans said, watch episode 150. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=617.86s)]
*  So I watched episode 150. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=619.86s)]
*  And then the fans said, well, you've got to get through the first seven arcs. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=620.86s)]
*  So through the first seven arcs I went. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=623.86s)]
*  And I decided that I'm going to watch all of One Piece [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=626.86s)]
*  because I'm going to look for this mythical One Piece where the show starts to get good. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=631.86s)]
*  I keep hearing it exists. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=637.86s)]
*  I think a lot of One Pieces, A, sunk cost fallacy. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=640.86s)]
*  And B, I think people grew up with it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=645.86s)]
*  And if you didn't grow up with it, I don't know if it hits the same way. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=648.86s)]
*  But I will persist. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=650.86s)]
*  I will watch the entire show so that I am not an ignoramus talking about something that I don't understand. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=652.86s)]
*  I will withhold my judgment. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=657.86s)]
*  And I will withhold my belief that one day, some shining day, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=659.86s)]
*  there's going to be an episode that I watch where I go, I get it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=664.86s)]
*  I get it now. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=668.86s)]
*  And I will tell people what number episode that is. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=670.86s)]
*  So that means that, OK, for the next four or five years, you won't be hearing about One Piece from Will. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=673.86s)]
*  How many episodes are there? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=679.86s)]
*  1,087, I think. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=681.86s)]
*  Who has time for all that? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=683.86s)]
*  I do. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=685.86s)]
*  To find out if the good episodes exist. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=686.86s)]
*  Are you completely caught up with this one? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=688.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=690.86s)]
*  That's psychotic. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=691.86s)]
*  I've been caught up. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=692.86s)]
*  Fillers, too? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=693.86s)]
*  No, I skipped the fillers. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=695.86s)]
*  And I did switch it to One Pace for a little bit. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=698.86s)]
*  And, dude, there are certain arts... [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=703.86s)]
*  Oh, wait, sorry, sorry. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=705.86s)]
*  Say that again? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=706.86s)]
*  One Pace? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=708.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. What's One Pace for those people who don't know? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=709.86s)]
*  One Pace is a fan edit of One Piece. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=711.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=714.86s)]
*  Because Toei Animation... [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=715.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=716.86s)]
*  No, no. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=717.86s)]
*  No, no, no. Yeah, no, I'm listening. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=718.86s)]
*  I readily admit that, and every One Piece fan will readily admit... [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=719.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=723.86s)]
*  That the majority of the episodes that you're even watching are not worth watching. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=724.86s)]
*  No. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=729.86s)]
*  That there are sections within the good episodes that are not worth your time. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=730.86s)]
*  That's why everybody says read the manga. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=733.86s)]
*  Because the manga is obviously a condensed version that perfectly captures... [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=735.86s)]
*  Well, I watch Cowboy Bebop Pace a lot, too. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=739.86s)]

*  It's a one season... [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=763.86s)]
*  Like, what would you call it? A mini-series? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=765.86s)]

*  But I will say that there is truth to what you're saying. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=789.86s)]
*  There's truth to your criticisms. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=794.86s)]

*  It's a perfectly fine anime. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=809.86s)]
*  You're right, though. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=811.86s)]
*  I don't understand the statuses of anime. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=812.86s)]
*  It is because a lot of people grow up with it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=813.86s)]

*  to like juxtapose both things and actually preach a platform of nonviolence. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=952.86s)]

*  Steins Gate is like so Marshcoded [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1312.86s)]
*  because it starts so cute, but it gets so tortured. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1314.86s)]
*  And I feel like that's your aesthetic. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1316.86s)]

*  It's basically Harry Potter anime. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1341.86s)]
*  But instead of lame ass Harry Potter, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1344.86s)]
*  the main character is almost akin to Saitama. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1346.86s)]

*  It didn't change. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1738.86s)]
*  This jacket doesn't help him much. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1739.86s)]
*  It's made of sheep's wool. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1740.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1741.86s)]

*  It's not even a jacket. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1749.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1750.86s)]

*  You've been hung by... [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1757.86s)]
*  Hanged by your own petard. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1758.86s)]
*  I feel like we have only gone to Shibuya so far. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1764.86s)]
*  I mean, that's typically how it goes. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1767.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1770.86s)]
*  I mean, there's other places for sure that we can... [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1774.86s)]
*  There are certainly other places. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1777.86s)]
*  But the things that we keep doing are kind of like... [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1779.86s)]
*  I mean, it goes back to our early streaming days when we were the Shibuya Boys. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1783.86s)]
*  That's true. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1787.86s)]
*  That is true. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1788.86s)]
*  We are the Shibuya Boys. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1789.86s)]
*  Guys, if you don't know, there's an old YouTube channel with Asana and I. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1790.86s)]
*  We lived in Japan for a decade. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1794.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1797.86s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1799.86s)]
*  And we would get into shenanigans with Shibuya. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1800.86s)]
*  Get drunk, roll around the floor. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1803.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1805.86s)]
*  We'd be fluent. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1806.86s)]
*  We'd be talking to people. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1807.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1808.86s)]
*  We forgot it all because of... [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1809.86s)]
*  Covid. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1811.86s)]
*  Long Covid. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1812.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1813.86s)]
*  Ketamine. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1814.86s)]
*  And Covid. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1815.86s)]
*  We just like... [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1816.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1818.86s)]
*  And also partially it's like, you know, we just don't want to speak Japanese now because it hurts so much. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1819.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=1826.86s)]

*  Wait, where's the elevator? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2664.86s)]
*  That was the room we were in. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2667.86s)]
*  That is the room we were in. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2668.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2669.86s)]
*  Well, that's good. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2671.86s)]
*  I was scared I'd never find this place again. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2672.86s)]
*  The timelines are merging. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2674.86s)]
*  I honestly was worried I'd never see this place because it was sick. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2677.86s)]
*  I guess we'll do karaoke instead. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2681.86s)]
*  We might have to. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2684.86s)]
*  We'll see if this works out or not. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2685.86s)]
*  If it doesn't, then fuck it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2688.86s)]
*  Why not? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2690.86s)]
*  A little karaoke sesh? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2691.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2692.86s)]
*  Stay with me. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2694.86s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were throwing it back for me. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2699.86s)]
*  I was giving it to you. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2700.86s)]
*  So big enough. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2702.86s)]
*  The big cup it's in. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2703.86s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2716.86s)]
*  Are we outside? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2719.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2720.86s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2721.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2722.86s)]
*  I assume the gym is originally called Fragment and then they just do a little karaoke. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2723.86s)]
*  I assume the gym is originally called Fragment and then they just do like, they go through [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2730.86s)]
*  seasonal. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2735.86s)]
*  I like the morning here. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2736.86s)]
*  I don't think this is seasonal. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2740.86s)]
*  This seems like a pretty full-time one-piece. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2742.86s)]
*  This is pretty established. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2746.86s)]
*  Something's going on here because the bay bay thing is booked out for like a year, but [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2748.86s)]
*  the one-piece gym is a ghost. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2760.86s)]
*  In the heart of Shibuya? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2763.86s)]
*  Maybe Japanese people just don't like to get down like that. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2765.86s)]
*  What's so funny? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2769.86s)]
*  I think it's cunt. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2771.86s)]
*  Like a glove. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2773.86s)]
*  I said it's cunt. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2775.86s)]
*  I get it. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2777.86s)]
*  I really support you. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2778.86s)]
*  Another baby teenager? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2780.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2782.86s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2799.86s)]
*  Oh, that's how he scanned in? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2800.86s)]

*  And it's a one-of-a-kind. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2803.86s)]
*  Please touch. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2807.86s)]
*  How many hours do we want to use? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2811.86s)]
*  It's up to five hours. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2818.86s)]
*  It said no photo. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2819.86s)]
*  You guys want to do a, you guys want to do, come here. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2821.86s)]
*  You have all your IDs, right? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2826.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2828.86s)]
*  Not passports, but IDs. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2829.86s)]
*  Okay, so we can get vis-a-vis, 13,000 yen up to five hours. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2831.86s)]
*  Do you want to keep it? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2837.86s)]
*  No. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2839.86s)]
*  Small badge, postcard, all this stuff. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2840.86s)]
*  Shoes? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2842.86s)]
*  Shoes. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2843.86s)]
*  Do we get to keep the shoes? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2844.86s)]
*  I don't think it gives you, I think the shoes are just to wear maybe in the gym. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2845.86s)]
*  Yeah, you can't. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2848.86s)]
*  Yeah, shoes are to wear in the gym. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2849.86s)]
*  Oh. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2852.86s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2853.86s)]
*  That's shoes. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2854.86s)]
*  It must. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2855.86s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2860.86s)]
*  And you have to go into the walkthrough before, I think. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2861.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2865.86s)]
*  We should each get our own character in the one-piece lore as well. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2866.86s)]
*  What is the deck program ticket? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2869.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2871.86s)]
*  Let's get one. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2872.86s)]
*  Oh, we can do a group lesson with the deck program ticket first. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2873.86s)]
*  Do you want to do that? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2876.86s)]
*  Yeah, and we can each be our own character. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2877.86s)]
*  Okay, let's just do that. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2879.86s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2881.86s)]
*  Tell her we're each getting a shirt as well. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2882.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2887.86s)]
*  You can get a bright man t-shirt as well. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2888.86s)]
*  It comes with it. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2890.86s)]
*  And a shaker. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2891.86s)]
*  Everybody, the package we're getting for you guys includes a shaker and a t-shirt. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2892.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2897.86s)]
*  You can get your body composition measured out. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2898.86s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2900.86s)]
*  And then have the body composition in this paper as well. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2901.86s)]
*  Marge, come show this. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2904.86s)]
*  Are they cool with this filming? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2906.86s)]
*  They're going to hand the original paper in this one-piece style. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2909.86s)]
*  You get a postcard and you get a deck program ticket as well. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2914.86s)]
*  So we can do a program together. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2917.86s)]
*  What do we think? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2919.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2920.86s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2921.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2922.86s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2923.86s)]
*  Did you ask about filming? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2924.86s)]
*  I told them in the beginning that we're filming, and I think that they know that we're filming [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2925.86s)]
*  and are not even remotely confused by this. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2929.86s)]
*  I feel like we'll do that here. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2933.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2935.86s)]
*  This is you? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2936.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2937.86s)]
*  Oh, but no. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2938.86s)]
*  I like this one. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2939.86s)]
*  Japanese kanji. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2940.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2941.86s)]
*  So one-piece character. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2942.86s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2943.86s)]
*  Didn't you cosplay this guy? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2944.86s)]
*  I did cosplay Zora. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2945.86s)]
*  I love Zora. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2946.86s)]
*  He's my favorite character, but this one is so sick. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2947.86s)]
*  Are these baby tees? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2948.86s)]
*  These are baby tees. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2949.86s)]
*  These are like youth shirts. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2950.86s)]
*  But I would also rock a baby tee, personally. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2951.86s)]
*  I like these. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2952.86s)]

*  I don't think he's fitting a baby tee. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2966.86s)]
*  I think he'll fit. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2967.86s)]
*  I think you underestimate me. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2968.86s)]
*  He'll fit in there. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2969.86s)]
*  Damn. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2970.86s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2971.86s)]
*  I could probably fit in there. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2972.86s)]
*  You have the man who's so cool. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2973.86s)]
*  I think your chest would... [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2974.86s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna get... [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2975.86s)]
*  I'm so glad I'm getting my body composition taken when I'm so fat. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=2976.86s)]

*  Yep. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4910.84s)]
*  He does not make sense [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4912.84s)]
*  that I have lower body fat percentage. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4914.84s)]
*  The machine is broken. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4916.84s)]
*  No, you have body dysmorphia. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4918.84s)]
*  You're so skinny. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4920.84s)]
*  You haven't eaten in the last year. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4922.84s)]

*  for every day from 5am to like 5pm. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4926.84s)]
*  That's probably why I have lower body fat percentage than you right now. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4928.84s)]
*  Because I haven't eaten yet today. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4930.84s)]
*  I had a delicious meal. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4934.84s)]
*  I had to take a course of antibiotics [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4936.84s)]
*  during Christmas [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4938.84s)]
*  break. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4940.84s)]
*  And it messed up my gut flora. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4942.84s)]

*  Austin, you have visible [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4950.84s)]
*  six pack abs. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4952.84s)]
*  I have a big belly in willow [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4954.84s)]

*  Y'all know, Google it. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4958.84s)]

*  I'm not. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=4998.84s)]
*  Being hot means nothing. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5000.84s)]
*  I think I'm probably about the same. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5002.84s)]
*  Maybe a little less. Maybe a little bit more. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5004.84s)]
*  If Austin has the lowest body fat [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5006.84s)]

*  I'm old? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5030.84s)]
*  When you're younger you have subcutaneous fat. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5032.84s)]
*  That's the fat. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5034.84s)]
*  That's like huge. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5036.84s)]
*  This is where a lot of your fat is probably carried. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5038.84s)]
*  This is way too big. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5040.84s)]

*  I'm kind of curious. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5182.84s)]
*  I'll do it later. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5184.84s)]
*  Okay, go. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5186.84s)]
*  Here's the papers with our [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5188.84s)]
*  data on it. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5190.84s)]
*  Wait, I don't understand... [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5192.84s)]
*  Bro, you literally have visible abs. I don't. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5194.84s)]
*  It doesn't, I'll be honest, I do think the system [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5196.84s)]
*  may be a little flawed. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5198.84s)]
*  Someone said the Chick-fil-A. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5200.84s)]
*  Oh... [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5202.84s)]
*  I mean, you know what? Hey, look, it just [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5204.84s)]
*  means I gotta get back to work. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5206.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter what your body fat [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5208.84s)]
*  represents. What's the gym called? Braggmen? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5210.84s)]
*  Braggmen, yeah. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5212.84s)]
*  No, no, it comes up as a one-piece gym. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5214.84s)]
*  Who needs their towel? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5216.84s)]
*  It's in Shibuya, right? Yeah. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5218.84s)]
*  It comes up as a one-piece gym, but Braggmen also works. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5220.84s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5222.84s)]
*  What? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5224.84s)]
*  I'm... [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5230.84s)]
*  Oh, somebody said it doesn't [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5232.84s)]
*  account for muscle. That makes total sense. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5234.84s)]
*  What are you talking about? It's body fat percentage. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5236.84s)]
*  No, no, they're right about that. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5238.84s)]
*  No, that's literally what... [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5240.84s)]
*  No, no, I agree. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5242.84s)]
*  Yeah, the weight doesn't account for the muscle weight. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5244.84s)]
*  Yeah, yell at Coug. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5246.84s)]
*  Alright. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5248.84s)]
*  That's the entire point of that thing. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5250.84s)]
*  No. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5252.84s)]
*  Caroline sent me this [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5254.84s)]
*  with no explanation. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5256.84s)]
*  And I go, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5258.84s)]
*  why did you send me this? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5260.84s)]
*  And she said, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5262.84s)]
*  I thought you'd like it. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5264.84s)]
*  Oh, sick. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5266.84s)]
*  I mean, you did though. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5270.84s)]
*  I did. It's very much in your wheelhouse of things. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5272.84s)]
*  She just knows you. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5274.84s)]
*  She cares about you. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5276.84s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5278.84s)]
*  Why are you flexing, bro? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5280.84s)]
*  Segoy. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5284.84s)]
*  Austin hit the [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5286.84s)]
*  body fat composition machine [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5288.84s)]
*  and said, oh, it doesn't factor in muscle mass. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5290.84s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5292.84s)]
*  What did I tell you? I said I'd be higher than you. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5294.84s)]
*  I'm genuinely confused. I think it's just broken. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5296.84s)]
*  You think it's broken? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5298.84s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think it's broken, but those things are not real. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5300.84s)]
*  Like, I mean, they're not good. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5302.84s)]
*  Oh, wake is here. Do you want to go see how to wake? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5304.84s)]
*  At the gym? Yeah. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5306.84s)]
*  We can't step over there with our shoes though. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5310.84s)]
*  I think he's right here. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5312.84s)]
*  Good morning, sir. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5320.84s)]
*  Good morning. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5322.84s)]
*  Wait, do you watch One Piece? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5324.84s)]
*  They genuinely look like two One Piece characters. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5326.84s)]
*  They're almost like 100 episodes of it. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5328.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5330.84s)]
*  Did you get the VMI composite calculator package? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5332.84s)]
*  No. Number A? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5334.84s)]
*  No, I got C. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5336.84s)]
*  We all got it. Okay, we're going to ask [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5338.84s)]
*  Wade. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5340.84s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5342.84s)]
*  I figured it out. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5344.84s)]
*  I got to tie my shoe. Oh, fuck. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5346.84s)]
*  I got to tie my shoe, chat. Hold on. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5348.84s)]
*  I'm going to warm up for like 10 minutes and get a sweat. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5350.84s)]
*  And then wait. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5356.84s)]
*  Because I feel like shit. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5358.84s)]
*  All of their body dysmorphia has activated completely. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5362.84s)]
*  This was probably a bad idea. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5366.84s)]
*  This has probably permanently altered the trajectory of the course. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5370.84s)]
*  All future dinner reservations have been cancelled. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5374.84s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5380.84s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5386.84s)]
*  Oh, oh. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5390.84s)]
*  I got the big TV girl. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5392.84s)]
*  Oh, I can't read. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5394.84s)]
*  Nice. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5396.84s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5398.84s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5400.84s)]
*  That's what my waist looks like. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5402.84s)]
*  Singed. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5406.84s)]
*  Turn to the side. I'm done. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5408.84s)]
*  True shit. If you look like this, DM me. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5410.84s)]
*  I want you to rank it without looking. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5414.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5416.84s)]
*  Who do you think highest body fat percentage of all of you? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5418.84s)]
*  Highest body fat percentage of all of you. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5420.84s)]
*  Highest body fat percentage of all of you? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5424.84s)]
*  You can say. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5426.84s)]
*  I think it would probably. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5430.84s)]
*  I think the Son of Miller close. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5432.84s)]
*  I think Austin's leaner. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5434.84s)]
*  I haven't seen you shirtless in like months. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5436.84s)]
*  Like probably half a month. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5438.84s)]
*  Jesus Christ. Half a year. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5440.84s)]
*  Maybe half a month. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5442.84s)]
*  Who do you think is the highest? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5444.84s)]
*  Highest? [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5446.84s)]
*  I won't be in the line. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5448.84s)]
*  I think. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5452.84s)]
*  Well, I haven't seen you shirtless in a second. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5454.84s)]
*  Did I see you shirtless two days ago? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5456.84s)]
*  Hey, pop that top off right now. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5460.84s)]
*  You know what? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5462.84s)]
*  I think I'm going to body inspection here. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5464.84s)]
*  I think Hassan might have a little more body fat than Will. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5468.84s)]
*  That's what I think too. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5470.84s)]
*  But it could also be that Will has a little more body fat than Hassan. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5472.84s)]
*  I think Austin is leaner. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5474.84s)]
*  So I'm going to go here. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5478.84s)]
*  I think I'm going to go [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5484.84s)]
*  Austin, Hassan by a hair, and then Will. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5486.84s)]
*  Am I right or am I wrong? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5490.84s)]
*  You're the highest? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5492.84s)]
*  So I'm the highest. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5494.84s)]
*  And Austin is the lowest. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5496.84s)]
*  How much are you the highest by? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5498.84s)]
*  That's what you said? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5500.84s)]
*  No, I didn't say you're the highest. I said you're a little bit less than Will. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5502.84s)]
*  Oh, you're saying I have lower body fat than Will. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5504.84s)]
*  And Austin has lower body fat than me. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5508.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5512.84s)]
*  Okay, then what is it? Did you guys do an electro thing? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5514.84s)]
*  You know that thing told me I was .2% body fat when I did it in Camp Canoe? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5516.84s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5518.84s)]
*  That's not real. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5520.84s)]
*  You said I was 18% body fat. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5522.84s)]
*  It also is entirely dependent on your level. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5524.84s)]
*  It's entirely dependent on your level of [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5528.84s)]
*  how hydrated you are. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5530.84s)]
*  No, those things are bogus. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5532.84s)]
*  It's not accurate. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5534.84s)]
*  So wait, what was the list? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5536.84s)]
*  I need to get back to the start again. I understand. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5538.84s)]
*  I'm ready. Look, I understand. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5540.84s)]
*  Will, what are you? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5542.84s)]
*  I'm ready to focus. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5544.84s)]
*  Christian was 14 I think. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5546.84s)]
*  So you were the lowest by a significant... [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5548.84s)]
*  You slob. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5550.84s)]
*  Not that significant. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5552.84s)]
*  I was 15. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5554.84s)]
*  Well, no, I mean like, one, one... [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5556.84s)]
*  I mean they were 18, 17. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5558.84s)]
*  So you had a significant gap. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5560.84s)]
*  They're going to be doing cardio. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5562.84s)]
*  I'm going to start lifting. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5564.84s)]
*  Wait, where do you lift me? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5566.84s)]
*  Do you want me to film that? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5568.84s)]
*  What sort of muscle group shall we hit first? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5570.84s)]
*  I'm filming that. It's probably more interesting. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5572.84s)]
*  It's my off day today, so I can just do a little bit of everything. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5574.84s)]
*  Let's do fun muscles, because everybody likes to watch fun muscles. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5578.84s)]
*  Like biceps. Let's do biceps. Fun muscles. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5582.84s)]
*  Please, give us some content. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5584.84s)]
*  Yeah, fun muscles. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5586.84s)]
*  So we can do arms. Let's do arms because it's more fun. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5588.84s)]
*  Do you want to do biceps? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5590.84s)]
*  I'm going to do biceps, triceps, shoulders. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5592.84s)]
*  Let's get biceps. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5594.84s)]
*  Triceps and shoulders? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5596.84s)]
*  So what I would probably do, first and foremost, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5598.84s)]
*  I'll probably train my rear delts because I'll skip them if I don't. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5602.84s)]
*  We also didn't do them last week. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5604.84s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't do rear delts last week. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5606.84s)]
*  They have a nice hammer strike. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5608.84s)]
*  I like this. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5610.84s)]
*  We can do this, rear delts. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5612.84s)]
*  Bro, what characters did you get? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5614.84s)]
*  I told you, I got the titty girl. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5616.84s)]
*  That's all of them, bro. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5618.84s)]
*  No, no, you got to go to character. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5620.84s)]
*  What did you get off it? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5622.84s)]
*  Just trying to find my Nikko Robin, you know what I'm saying? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5624.84s)]
*  Are they giving you your body comparison? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5626.84s)]
*  No, you got white beard. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5628.84s)]
*  He got white beard. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5630.84s)]
*  So he got white beard. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5632.84s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5634.84s)]
*  I got this guy. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5636.84s)]
*  I forget his name. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5638.84s)]
*  He's the Goldie Rogers second in command. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5640.84s)]
*  No, he's dope. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5642.84s)]
*  He's a sick character. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5644.84s)]
*  Rayleigh is the name of the thing. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5646.84s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5648.84s)]
*  Let me look. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5650.84s)]
*  I got fucking a big mom. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5652.84s)]
*  Big mom. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5654.84s)]
*  Mama, mama. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5656.84s)]
*  Honestly, it's uncanny. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5658.84s)]
*  Honestly, it's uncanny. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5660.84s)]
*  Alright, weirdos. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5662.84s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5664.84s)]
*  Can we stash all these somewhere safe? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5666.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5668.84s)]
*  I'm going to fucking burn when I'm here. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5670.84s)]
*  Can we come back to weirdos? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5672.84s)]
*  Because I feel like it's more fun to watch Biceps. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5674.84s)]
*  You can do whatever you want to do. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5676.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5678.84s)]
*  I know. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5680.84s)]
*  But I feel like we should, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5682.84s)]
*  if we're going to do something, let's do something for the viewers. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5684.84s)]
*  Let's do something fun, something they can look at. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5686.84s)]
*  He's right. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5688.84s)]
*  Biceps. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5690.84s)]
*  We're doing biceps. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5692.84s)]
*  Do they have barbells here? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5694.84s)]
*  We can do legs. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5696.84s)]
*  Oh, we can look at our fat and muscle percentage. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5698.84s)]
*  Yeah, it shows your fat distribution as well. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5700.84s)]
*  Or like your muscle distribution. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5702.84s)]
*  How about you punch the bag over there? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5704.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do that. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5706.84s)]
*  Punch the bag? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5710.84s)]
*  You're boxing. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5712.84s)]
*  Or just dumbbells. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5714.84s)]
*  Do they have gloves? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5716.84s)]
*  No, punch it raw. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5718.84s)]
*  That's too short, right? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5730.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's very short. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5732.84s)]
*  He's a small man. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5734.84s)]
*  He's beating up a small man. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5736.84s)]
*  Why don't you get this? [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5738.84s)]
*  I thought we were stashing him somewhere. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5740.84s)]
*  This is oddly equipped. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5742.84s)]
*  Maybe it's not bad. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5744.84s)]
*  I'll put it in the locker. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5746.84s)]
*  You mean for the little gimmicky sort of? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5748.84s)]
*  Bitcoin? [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5750.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's Bitcoin. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5752.84s)]
*  Bitcoin weight. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5754.84s)]
*  That's real loud. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5756.84s)]
*  Dude, look at him. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5764.84s)]
*  That's your advantage. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5768.84s)]
*  They have no practice punching up. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5770.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think the average Japanese person can reach. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5772.84s)]
*  You have to jump up. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5776.84s)]
*  Sometimes, chat, you get knocked down, you have to get back in the lab. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5780.84s)]
*  He took it to heart. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5786.84s)]
*  He took it so personally. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5788.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5790.84s)]
*  I saw you both shirtless. You guys are really similar. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5796.84s)]
*  You have more definition in your back than I do. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5798.84s)]
*  How do you think you guys are 18% higher? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5802.84s)]
*  I don't think so either. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5804.84s)]
*  Maybe his legs are just pure fat. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5806.84s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen you in shorts in my life. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5808.84s)]
*  I know my legs are skinny. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5810.84s)]
*  I don't think you're not. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5812.84s)]
*  No, but your legs are skinny. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5814.84s)]
*  My legs are skinny. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5816.84s)]
*  I have been putting on some meat in the legs. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5818.84s)]
*  I will say, I think eyeballing it, obviously the best possible way to do it is with water displacement. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5820.84s)]
*  But eyeballing it is probably a better measurement of your body fat percentage than with the shoes. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5828.84s)]
*  Just drop this thing on the ground. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5836.84s)]
*  That's what I say, but then Austin can get a full stretch. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5838.84s)]
*  I thought I could get the full stretch that way. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5840.84s)]
*  Let everyone get a full stretch. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5844.84s)]
*  I was getting a full stretch, but that's just me. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5846.84s)]
*  We're going to a fanning mart because I need to have her. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5850.84s)]
*  Can you grab me a water too? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5854.84s)]
*  Let me spot you. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5856.84s)]
*  Do you want to pull Kari Sweatwater? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5858.84s)]
*  Bro, when are we going to go rip some Beyblades? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5860.84s)]
*  You see that? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5862.84s)]
*  Dude, yes, we already inquired. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5864.84s)]
*  We already inquired. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5866.84s)]
*  I will, but you need to go get stuff. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5868.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be back. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5870.84s)]
*  That'll work. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5872.84s)]
*  Everyone's doing biceps and shoulders today. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5874.84s)]
*  Austin asked me what I was training. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5876.84s)]
*  I told him biceps and triceps. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5878.84s)]
*  Yeah, biceps and triceps. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5880.84s)]
*  I'm doing biceps, triceps, and shoulders. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5882.84s)]
*  Slow it down. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5884.84s)]
*  Mind-muscle connection. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5886.84s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5888.84s)]
*  Focus. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5890.84s)]
*  Keep going. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5892.84s)]
*  Tap a shot of that. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=5894.84s)]

*  135? It's one plate. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6140.84s)]
*  I did chest yesterday. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6142.84s)]
*  I also don't do bench press. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6146.84s)]
*  Look at your happy feet. You got your soccer feet right now, dude. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6158.84s)]
*  He's already hitting weights out here. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6164.84s)]
*  He's going crazy. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6166.84s)]
*  I'll do one more after I'm done. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6168.84s)]
*  I don't do bench press ever. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6172.84s)]
*  No, that was really good. I know. I just don't do bench press. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6174.84s)]
*  Five is... [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6178.84s)]
*  No. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6180.84s)]
*  10 kilograms. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6182.84s)]
*  We'll put 10 on it. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6184.84s)]
*  So that's like 20. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6186.84s)]
*  That's like 30. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6188.84s)]
*  Well, 20 is 45-ish. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6190.84s)]
*  10 kilograms is 25-ish? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6192.84s)]
*  23 and 22 and a half. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6196.84s)]
*  Isn't it like 2.6 times? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6200.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6202.84s)]
*  I assume that they have to be the same [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6204.84s)]
*  regardless of metric or not, right? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6206.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6208.84s)]
*  Just about. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6210.84s)]
*  I love lat pulldowns. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6222.84s)]
*  That's why my upper back looks the way it does. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6226.84s)]
*  You're just spamming lat pulldowns? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6228.84s)]
*  Not that I spam it, but I think I... [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6230.84s)]
*  I've always like pulled... [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6232.84s)]
*  Wait, how many can you do with 225? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6248.84s)]
*  How many can I do with 225? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6250.84s)]
*  How many can I do? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6252.84s)]
*  I haven't benched in so long. I don't know. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6254.84s)]
*  Really? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6256.84s)]
*  Yeah, probably...I don't know. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6258.84s)]
*  Good set. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6260.84s)]
*  10-ish maybe? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6262.84s)]
*  I can't do 10. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6264.84s)]
*  You've been cutting for a while, bro. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6266.84s)]
*  You've been cutting for a long time, right? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6268.84s)]
*  I know. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6270.84s)]
*  I cannot do two plates for 10 now. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6272.84s)]
*  And it's really annoying. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6274.84s)]
*  Because at my peak [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6276.84s)]
*  I was able to do... [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6278.84s)]
*  Wait, I'll just keep the set. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6280.84s)]
*  You wanted to try this? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6282.84s)]
*  I'm going to put more weight on this in a second. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6284.84s)]
*  I just want to... [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6286.84s)]
*  Actually, I don't care about biceps. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6288.84s)]
*  At my peak, I was around [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6292.84s)]
*  this body fat percentage, but I was like 26. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6294.84s)]
*  And I could do [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6296.84s)]
*  245 for like 15. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6298.84s)]
*  You were just like, repping it? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6300.84s)]
*  Like shit though? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6302.84s)]
*  Just like being young and dumb and pumping weight? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6304.84s)]
*  I don't know, but I just cannot... [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6306.84s)]
*  Like, you might be stronger now. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6308.84s)]
*  Or you're just depleted. Like, do you eat as many carbs [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6310.84s)]
*  as you used to? No. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6312.84s)]
*  I could literally just be dietary. If you like, ate like an asshole [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6314.84s)]
*  for a day and then went and tried, you'd probably be [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6316.84s)]
*  just about as strong. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6318.84s)]
*  Sometimes being strong is just eating like an asshole. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6324.84s)]
*  That's true. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6326.84s)]
*  Even during like [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6330.84s)]
*  a year and a half ago, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6332.84s)]
*  I was definitely much fatter, but I could do [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6334.84s)]
*  25 for... [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6336.84s)]
*  10. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6338.84s)]
*  Can't do it now. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6340.84s)]
*  About to try. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6342.84s)]
*  Where's Marsh with the waters? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6350.84s)]
*  Shut up Marsh though. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6352.84s)]
*  This bag's... hot. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6356.84s)]
*  This is hot. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6358.84s)]
*  The gym is also very warm. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6364.84s)]
*  Look at the pump and heat. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6366.84s)]
*  The sauna. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6368.84s)]
*  This is a very interesting vibe for a gym. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6370.84s)]
*  They're blasting heat in here. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6372.84s)]
*  They got... not the craziest music. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6374.84s)]
*  Very slow jams. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSDtvF2t4s&t=6376.84s)]
