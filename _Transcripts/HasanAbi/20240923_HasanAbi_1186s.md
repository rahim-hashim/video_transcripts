# Robinson Remains Confident Despite Accusations | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0)
*  10 years ago. He was a random gooner that worked at a furniture assembly plant. And it's the same [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=0.0s)]
*  that it's the exact same principle behind like Christopher Ruffo being like, Oh, I can't believe [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  that you're lying and saying that like, you know, my email was in the Ashley Madison leagues that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=13.52s)]
*  were in 2019. Who knew who Christopher Ruffo was in 2019? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=20.8s)]
*  All business people. We're here for all those parents out there that are losing their children [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  to fentanyl. We're here for all those people out there. Bro, every time I see him now, I can't [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=35.52s)]
*  unsee the titty shirt that he purchased in bulk that he left a phenomenal Amazon review over. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  And I'm always thinking to myself, like, I really can't tell. I really can't tell if it's working [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=50.64s)]
*  or if it's not working. He's got the gyno shirt, right? And I don't know if the gyno shirt is like [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=55.52s)]
*  working or if the gyno shirt is not working. It's boosting and separating his confidence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=62.16s)]
*  As a fellow fat man, that man is large and is working for him. I feel like the gyno shirt also [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=66.88s)]
*  makes his like, like it weirdly, it weirdly pushes his titties all the way up into his arms kind of. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=72.32s)]
*  So when he moves his arms out, it looks crazy. We're here for the people who are, we're here for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  the people who are struggling to get- Like, look, do you see that? Like his nipple moved [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=84.4s)]
*  outside of where his nipple is supposed to be. I don't think he's got the gyno shirt on, Chad. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Their children are decent education. We're not here to talk about 15 or 20 year old Salacious [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=94.72s)]
*  false lies. They don't want to talk about what's going on right now. They want to talk about what- [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  That man right there is like, listen, Mark, when you're done, could you happen to send me a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=105.52s)]
*  one of them, one of them codes that I could use to buy that gyno comastia shirt you were talking [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  about on Amazon? I saw that on the CNN article. Seems quite like a, seems, seems like it's working [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=116.64s)]
*  quite nice for you. I'd like to pack my in as well, sir. Okay. Possibly happened 15 years ago. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=123.92s)]
*  The staff resignations follow a CNN investigation that unearthed graphic and inflammatory comments [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=130.48s)]
*  Robinson made several years ago on a website. He denies making those posts and CNN's Diane [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=135.84s)]
*  Gallagher joins me from Wilkes-Barreau, North Carolina. Diane, what else is Robinson saying [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=141.6s)]
*  this morning? You know, Jim, this is the first appearance by Robinson since the more than half [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=148.32s)]
*  a dozen senior campaign staff resigned this weekend and about several of the 45 to 50 [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=154.4s)]
*  supporters who showed up here today in Wilkes-Barreau said that's precisely what made them come. They [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=161.2s)]
*  wanted to show support for Robinson and what they describe as a very difficult time for him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  Robinson didn't directly address those allegations beyond calling them salacious lies from the past [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  that may or may not have happened when he spoke to supporters, but he did address that and the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=179.12s)]
*  campaign departures when he spoke with press as soon as he finished the event. Take a listen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=184.0s)]
*  We have full confidence so we can go on. We're getting resumes from all over. We're getting [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=189.04s)]
*  offers from all over people jumping. I'm new to policies. This is good when you got, when half of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=192.96s)]
*  your staff resigns, after they find out that you're a serial gooner with goon debt, like that's, that's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=198.96s)]
*  as someone who has studied the way of goon, okay, the art of gooning, I have never actually found [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=206.56s)]
*  a person that has been in goon debt. Okay. Especially because like materials are so readily [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=213.36s)]
*  available online at this point for free that like it truly blows my mind when you hear about a guy [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=218.4s)]
*  who like went into debt for his art is Robinson or Kamala or stronger, small business care candidate, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=224.4s)]
*  duh, no Robinson. I've never heard of Kamala Harris going into debt to support a small business. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=230.8s)]
*  Okay. I have however seen Mark Robinson one defense small businesses online by literally giving [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=237.84s)]
*  phenomenal reviews on Amazon to small businesses that sell replica RC helicopters and small [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  businesses who also are selling gynecomastia shirts. I've also literally seen him put his money where [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=252.56s)]
*  his mouth is when his mouth is not fantasizing about eating out his sister-in-law after she peed [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=260.8s)]
*  on him. He literally went into debt. He went into debt, trying to defend a small business that was [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=269.44s)]
*  going to go out of business as a direct consequence of the internet turning gooning into something [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=275.36s)]
*  that you can do on your computer for free. Like think about it this way. If there were 10 million [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=282.16s)]
*  Mark Robinson's that cared enough about physical copies of works of art, Blockbuster would still be [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=289.04s)]
*  in business. Okay. He literally has single-handedly turned the tide of history for this one porn shop [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  in Greensboro. Like it literally would have gone the way of Blockbuster. It should have gone the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  way of Blockbuster under normal market conditions and Mark Robinson straight up defended this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  institution from bankruptcy. I'm just going to say it dude. He is a better small business defender [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=316.16s)]
*  than Kamala Harris. It pains me to say so but. To help us we've made a ton of friends in this thing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  since we've been in a lot of talented people right now. We're reaching out to us and we're [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  right in the process right now of forming a team that we know can still lead us to victory. So we [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  have full confidence in our ability to keep going. But the timing of that them walking away from you [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=336.32000000000005s)]
*  right now. The timing doesn't matter. It's not the timing. It's how you react and we are ready to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=340.48s)]
*  react and we're doing it right now. We're getting it done. Lieutenant Governor Robinson you've talked about the reporting being [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=345.28s)]
*  salacious lies. Not true. Have you taken steps then to prove it's not you? We absolutely are. We absolutely are. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=350.08s)]
*  We're in talks right now. Everything up to legal counsel to take CNN to task for what they have done [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  to us. We are going after them. No. They 100% will not do that because it's real and Discovery [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=364.88s)]
*  would only prove that it's real and that would destroy his what remains of his campaign and his [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=374.56s)]
*  political ambitions. Okay. So no. And here's how you know it's real because it's his name dude. It's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=379.92s)]
*  his name. It's the same username he's used everywhere publicly and privately and it's and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=387.52s)]
*  the email associated with the account is his name and and birth date. And the thing is it's not like [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=393.76s)]
*  Mark Robinson was a known political entity. You know 10 14 years ago that someone would be like [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=399.84s)]
*  I'm going to make a fake account to ruin this man's political career 10 years ago. He was a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=408.0s)]
*  random gooner that worked at a furniture assembly plant and it's the same that it's the exact same [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=416.48s)]
*  principle behind like Christopher Ruffo being like, oh, I can't believe that you're lying and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=422.64s)]
*  saying that like, you know, my email was in the Ashley Madison leaks that were in 2019. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=429.36s)]
*  Who knew who Christopher Ruffo was in 2019? People still don't know who Christopher Ruffo is. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  You think someone was like looking at the the the people that are working at the Manhattan Institute [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=442.88s)]
*  to be like, hmm, let me sign up with their accounts to Ashley Madison with their emails [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=448.32s)]
*  to Ashley Madison in an effort to, you know, destroy their beautiful political career. If they [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=454.0s)]
*  might become a political operative later down the line, like, what are you stupid? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  Ain't nobody knew who you were dumbass. That's the difference. It's like if someone signs up [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=463.68s)]
*  Donald Trump's email to Ashley Madison now, like, yeah, there is a defense for that. You're like, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=468.88s)]
*  come on, dude, this man is cheated on his wife publicly. What would he do that on Ashley Madison? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=473.76s)]
*  It's very likely someone who has access to what his email is that signed him off. Like, it makes [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=478.24s)]
*  sense. He's a notable, prominent former president, right? Stories like that don't actually get a lot [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=482.88000000000005s)]
*  of play for that reason, because everybody understands, like with a little bit of critical [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  thinking, it's like, you know, it's a little bit different. You were a random guy. You were a random [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  guy, dog. Nobody is making African accounts with your name. He is not taking, by the way, he's not [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=498.72s)]
*  taking steps to track down the mysterious guy who made these posts. He rejected tech tech help, the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  track it down. Yeah. Okay. We are going to go after him for what they've done, but we have five [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=508.0s)]
*  weeks left in this race, folks. And make no mistake about it. We are not going to let CNN [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=513.76s)]
*  throw us off of our mission. Our mission is to win this race. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=518.8s)]
*  After CNN reported that Mark Robinson posted and lose comments on a website, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=524.64s)]
*  Robinson rejected offers some supporters to track down the origin of the post. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=527.76s)]
*  Sources tell WRAL. Oh, man. It's shocking to me. It's shocking to me. Yeah, not only that, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=531.2s)]
*  but as many soldiers YouTube accounts literally changed the I am the majority USA. Exactly. We [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=538.88s)]
*  look through all of this. I am dismayed about the fact, as I said before, think about how many people [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=543.2s)]
*  out there right now, right in this place where we are right now, who are hooked on fentanyl, who are [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=550.72s)]
*  hooked on opioids, and how many were hooked on gooning debt, folks. Nobody's talking about that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=555.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris is afraid to talk about that. He will die tonight because of think about what's [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=564.0s)]
*  going on on our border. Think about what's going on on the world stage. Yeah, he's like, don't think [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=570.8800000000001s)]
*  about that. Think about what's going on at the border instead. And this is what you this is what [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=576.48s)]
*  you choose to focus on. You've got these news cameras, news reporters, pens, pencils, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=582.24s)]
*  your microphones. This is what you're focused on. You're not focused on the things that we talked [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=587.04s)]
*  about standing up there about our economy. You're not focused on those things. I am. I'm going to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  remain focused on those things. And you better you better understand. I am coming after full CNN, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=598.16s)]
*  full throng. And in order to put the people first, in order to think about my sister, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=603.28s)]
*  my sister-in-law, and how her is farting. I mean, I didn't I don't think about that. That's [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=612.64s)]
*  somebody else. There was another Mark Robinson who thought about that on the nude Africa forums. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=619.92s)]
*  Put the people first. We've got to concentrate on this campaign. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=624.88s)]
*  That's exactly what we're going to do. No more questions. No more questions. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=631.36s)]
*  Hold on just a second. No more questions because you're from Greensboro. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=636.48s)]
*  And in Greensboro. Now Robinson may be talking about the fact that we're focusing on that, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=640.48s)]
*  but I can tell you there are plenty of Republicans in North Carolina who are as well concerned about [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=645.36s)]
*  what the CAFIL investigation as well as a significant staff departure means potentially [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=650.32s)]
*  for down ballot Republican candidates here in North Carolina, Jim. And look at the top of the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=655.44s)]
*  ticket. Former President Donald Trump was in North Carolina. He was in Wilmington on Saturday. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=660.16s)]
*  He did not invite Lieutenant Governor Robinson to appear with him on stage. Robinson had a small [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=666.08s)]
*  public event at a speedway instead in a different part of the state. Didn't even mention Robinson [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=673.52s)]
*  by name at that. And this is someone who at one point called Martin Luther King Jr. on steroids. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=679.12s)]
*  This is a person who had a speaking position at the RNC earlier this summer. And so while he is [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=685.12s)]
*  trying to focus on the campaign, I will tell you that other Republicans here in the state of North [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=692.16s)]
*  Carolina are very concerned about that investigation as well as the campaign shakeup. Yeah, I mean, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=696.48s)]
*  Diane, I mean, did Mark Robinson explain why these staffers are leaving if the report from [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=702.4s)]
*  this network is not true? No, they said that they stepped away on their own accord. They wish them [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  well. And the staffers themselves just saying this was something that happened on their own volition. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=714.4s)]
*  They have not gone into the specific details, but the timing, of course, coming just days after that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  K-file investigation was published. Yeah. Thank you very much. CNN's Kristen Holmes is here with me [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  now. As Diane mentioned, Robinson was not invited to Trump's rally over the weekend in North Carolina. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  Again, if there's something wrong with the reporting, you would think Donald Trump would [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=735.1999999999999s)]
*  have him up on stage, talk about him, didn't even mention him at this rally this weekend. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=738.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but you also might think that if this reporting was true, that Donald Trump [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=744.8s)]
*  would be out there disavowing him and saying that he shouldn't be running for office. But again, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=748.88s)]
*  Donald Trump has not said anything about it at all, remaining completely silent. And we have [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=753.36s)]
*  absolute faith in our reporting that these are Mark Robinson's words from this porn forum. Now, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=757.92s)]
*  Donald Trump, I am told, is not likely to invite Mark Robinson to any former or future events. He [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=764.4s)]
*  is expected to be in North Carolina again later this week. We shouldn't see Mark Robinson with [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=770.4s)]
*  him if that holds him not inviting him to any of these events. But in terms of disavowing him or [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=774.72s)]
*  disavowing what Donald Trump himself has said about Mark Robinson, we haven't seen any indication [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=780.08s)]
*  that that is happening. Now look, when it comes to the ticket, asking him to get off the ticket, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=785.36s)]
*  that's not possible. Donald Trump is not a fake friend. Okay. He will not disavow a supporter. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=789.28s)]
*  Okay. He has not disavowed straight up neo-Nazis. Do you understand? As long as people are pro [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=793.76s)]
*  Donald Trump, he is pro them. Very rarely does he ever come out and say something [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=800.56s)]
*  where he disavows someone unless they've wronged him. Okay. Unless they have wronged him. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=808.3199999999999s)]
*  Then he's like, you're done. You're cut. It's over for you, bro. Yeah. He didn't even disavow [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=815.68s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell, dude. He literally was like, I wish you're well. It's like, bro, what are you [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=820.4799999999999s)]
*  talking about? She was like, she's going to prison forever for participating in like sex [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=825.76s)]
*  trafficking of minors alongside like the most famous pedophile of all time. What the fuck do [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=834.16s)]
*  you mean? You wish him well. I'm telling you, man, it's a very funny thing that he does, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=840.8s)]
*  where he just cannot, unless someone has wronged him, unless someone has wronged him, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=849.6s)]
*  he's just not going to do it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=861.0400000000001s)]
*  Your reaction to that interview is one of my most rewatched YouTube videos where he says that about [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=866.08s)]
*  Ghislaine. Yeah. He didn't disavow the prod boys. He didn't disavow the Charlottesville Nazis. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=869.6s)]
*  So we know that the ballots have already gone out. There's military ballots as well as absentee [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=879.76s)]
*  ballots with Mark Robb. Bigger deal. This or Roy Moore. This like bigger deal in terms of like [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  electoral consequences because North Carolina isn't like North Carolina is not Alabama. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=892.4000000000001s)]
*  And Roy Moore lost because of what he did. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, I mean, he's definitely not going to win. Roy Moore was a worst person. Yes. Roy [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=902.0s)]
*  Moore was objectively a worst person. As far as we know, Mark Robinson is a gooner and a freak [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=910.16s)]
*  and is a, you know, black Nazi in his own words, but Roy Moore literally did diddle. He diddled so [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=916.08s)]
*  much so frequently. He diddled so much with such phenomenal frequency that they banned him. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=927.12s)]
*  They banned him from they banned him from the local mall, dude. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=939.52s)]
*  But this is more consequential because like Roy Moore lost. He will definitely lose, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=948.96s)]
*  but he's so toxic as far as like a brand. He is such a toxic brand at this point that like [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=953.84s)]
*  he might actually bring Trump down in the state of North Carolina, which is crazy. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=961.0400000000001s)]
*  Robinson's name at the top of the ticket, but there is huge amount of concern, as Diane said, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=968.48s)]
*  among Republicans that this is going to hurt his voters. Kerry. Fuck. Yes, they do. What dude, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=973.0400000000001s)]
*  he didn't. If it was just that he said he's a black Nazi, he would get more votes. Okay. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=977.6s)]
*  But it's not that he just said he's a black Nazi. He also was like, you know, in nude [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=983.84s)]
*  Africa forms writing like salacious shit. Republicans. Once again, Republicans absolutely [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=988.64s)]
*  will look at that and go, Oh, that's gross. That's too much. That's too much for me. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=997.12s)]
*  Donald Trump. If you look at the most recent polling, the New York Times put out today, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  it is well within the margin of error. It has Donald Trump leading by about two points again, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1004.88s)]
*  within the margin of error. People universally hate sexual predators. Wrong. You're absolutely [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1008.96s)]
*  dog. Donald Trump was president. What are you talking about? No, people don't universally hate [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1015.44s)]
*  sexual predators. The fuck look at like Dr. Disrespect support right now. No, people absolutely [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1020.32s)]
*  do not hate sexual predators. And they do not hate sexual predators universally, especially [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1028.24s)]
*  the right to vote. Either side, Harris or Trump is going to take that for granted. They want to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1034.48s)]
*  win the state of North Carolina, which has gotten increasingly closer since Kamala Harris was boosted [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1040.64s)]
*  to the top of the ticket. This could hurt him. The question is what would hurt him more him coming [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1045.04s)]
*  out and disavowing Mark Robinson or just leaving it alone? And it clearly as at this point, the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  campaign things just not saying anything is the right move for the former president. Yeah. And [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1055.92s)]
*  I have to think at this point, if Mark Robinson, if he's being unfairly maligned, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1060.72s)]
*  the Trump campaign would be coming out and embracing him. They must think inside the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1069.68s)]
*  Trump campaign that this is toxic too. Well, I will say talking to senior advisors, they thought [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1074.48s)]
*  that Mark Robinson was a problem for a long time. This is just the latest and this is obviously the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1079.2s)]
*  worst of what we've seen. This is just the worst of what we have seen, but he has caused problem [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1083.3600000000001s)]
*  after problem for them. At one point I went to an event in North Carolina and he was speaking [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1089.6s)]
*  before Donald Trump was taking the stage and the campaign made sure to tell us that he was not [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1094.96s)]
*  introducing the president. Even though he was speaking before him, they were going to have [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  someone else or a voice of God introduce Donald Trump, which seemed like a very determined or [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1102.8799999999999s)]
*  very specific clarification that they were making there. They don't want them to be lumped together, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1109.44s)]
*  but as you said, he has praised Robinson multiple times. So nothing on his part there about him [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1114.4s)]
*  coming out and saying, you know, I take back those comments and they sound pretty simpatico in terms [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1120.88s)]
*  of going after the press. And yet Mark Robinson, not on stage with Donald Trump this weekend, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1125.0400000000002s)]
*  not mentioned by Donald. Oh, we are damn dude. First they came after bro. They're coming after [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1129.0400000000002s)]
*  Mark Robinson and Laura Loomer. What's next, dude? It's like you're coming after everyone that [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1135.1200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump fucks. Okay. You can't come after all of his side pussy. Okay. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1141.28s)]
*  I find this unconscionable. What will they do to this man? First they did lawfare. Okay. First they [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1150.16s)]
*  stole the election from him. Then they did lawfare against them where they just basically hit him on [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1156.8s)]
*  federal courts. They hit him on state courts. Okay. Now they don't even want him to have sex. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1162.08s)]
*  They came after Laura Loomer and now they're coming after Mark Robinson. Who can he fuck at [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1168.88s)]
*  this point? His wife get out of here. That's not going to happen. It's actually messed up what [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1173.68s)]
*  they're doing. They came after his golfing, Ryan Ruth. You're right. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD5egf84g0&t=1179.92s)]
