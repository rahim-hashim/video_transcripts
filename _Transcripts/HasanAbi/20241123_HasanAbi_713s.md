# What Happened With Jay Leno? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co)
*  was lazy and they showed a picture of the incorrect hillside. Jay Leno fell down. So [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=0.0s)]
*  I did some of my own journalism to bring you the accurate story. He was staying at Hampton's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=3.04s)]
*  Hampton in and Greensburg PA because he was performing later that day at the palace theater [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  in downtown Greensburg. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=11.22s)]
*  Many people are confused as to why he'd be staying at a Hampton in, but that's one of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=12.9s)]
*  the only hotels in the Greensburg area. The only other option would be an hour drive away [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=16.04s)]
*  from Pittsburgh Jay Leno. And I don't know why, but not every couple of weeks, but like [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=20.02s)]
*  every couple of years. If you remember a while back, he like, didn't he get into like a car [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=29.44s)]
*  fire or something like he was in like an accident. And now he's just like, I don't know what [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=35.08s)]
*  the fuck's going on with him. Like he just every now and then Jay Leno will pop up. Okay. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=39.88s)]
*  And it's never for something good. It's always like, it's always like he has the worst injury [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  of all time. Okay. He has the absolute worst injury of all time. And it makes no fucking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=52.24s)]
*  sense. Let's get started with the Jay Leno stuff. Let's get started with that. Does anyone [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=60.24s)]
*  have the clip? Because I mean, trigger warning, Jay Leno, but also trigger warning. I don't [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=65.36s)]
*  know what the fuck happened to Jay Leno, but like he looks insanely fucked up here. They [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=71.84s)]
*  went, they went and they found his it's a new story in and of itself. Jay Leno has been [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=77.16s)]
*  seriously injured again after the convenience as he fell down a hill at Hampton Inn. What [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=82.44s)]
*  on earth happened to Jay Leno? Oh, your poor face. Look at my eye. Oh my gosh. Jay Leno [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  is all bruised up. The left side of his face is black and blue. His eye is swollen shut [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=93.52s)]
*  and look at his injured wrist. I broke my wrist, lost my nail on the finger and then [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=99.52s)]
*  I'm all black and blue. The comedian says he fell down a 60 foot hill. I said, well, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=106.64s)]
*  the hill doesn't look that steep. Let me take it down. And then I, you rolled down a hill. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=112.08s)]
*  That's not true. That's not what this, these injuries are not consistent with like actually [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  rolling down a hill. And of course, people found the hill that he was referencing. I [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=122.96s)]
*  don't even understand why he's staying at a Hampton's Inn by the way. Why the fuck is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  he staying at a Hampton's Inn? The inside edition reporting was lazy and they showed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  a picture of the incorrect hillside. Jay Leno fell down. So I did some of my own journalism [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=134.72s)]
*  to bring you the accurate story. He was staying at Hampton's Hampton Inn in Greensburg, PA [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=138.28s)]
*  because he was performing later that day at the Palace Theater in downtown Greensburg. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=143.48s)]
*  Many people are confused as to why he'd be staying at a Hampton Inn, but that's one of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=146.92s)]
*  the only hotels in the Greensburg area. The only other option would be an hour drive away [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=150.04s)]
*  from Pittsburgh. Jay wanted to eat at a nearby Dino's sports lounge, a popular area eatery [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=154.04s)]
*  that specialized in Buffalo chicken wings prior to the show to walk to dinos. You either [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=158.64s)]
*  have to walk 750 feet on the road, not a mile and a half as Jay mentioned, or you could [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=163.04s)]
*  shave off 350 feet. If you walk down the grassy hillside, Jay noticed a dirt path worn on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=167.92s)]
*  the hillside as is common in the Pittsburgh area. So he attempted, I liked that this is [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=173.0s)]
*  like a classic, you know, in Pittsburgh, we like to walk downhill. Okay. So he attempted [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  to take the shortcut and walk down the hill. Since the path was rough, not maintained and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=182.64s)]
*  eroded away, he tripped and rolled down the hill, hitting his head on the exposed rocks [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=186.6s)]
*  and earth on the way down the hill. Jay was remarkably accurate as he estimated that the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=189.88s)]
*  hill would be around 60 feet after measuring the hill is 56 feet from top to bottom. I [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=194.76s)]
*  just don't personally understand how this hill caused that much damage. Okay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=200.0s)]
*  True. No, that's true. Jay Leno says he was staying at a Hampton Inn about 30 miles outside [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=206.92s)]
*  of Pittsburgh on Saturday night when he wanted to have dinner at a local restaurant before [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  his show. Instead of walking a mile and a half down the road, he decided to take a shortcut [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=215.68s)]
*  down the hill. Not a good idea. This is believed to be the steep incline he told. No, okay. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=220.52s)]
*  That makes sense. If he fell off this, that would have made sense. But I, I believe the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=227.88s)]
*  Redditors. Well, it hit a bunch of rocks. It was 60 feet. Incredibly, the famous workaholic [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=231.62s)]
*  legend performed just three hours later without even taking a day off to nurse his injuries. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=237.24s)]
*  This isn't the first nor the last time Jay Leno will be injured severely. Okay. I just [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=243.28s)]
*  want you to understand something. Jason Leno, Jason Leno has, has been hurt before, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=250.24s)]
*  Didn't he almost die recently? Was it a stroke or what the f**k was it? Oh, there's a breakdown [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=258.2s)]
*  of his previous incidents. Okay. Anyway, let's finish this report and then we'll continue. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=263.7s)]
*  In November, 2022, he was severely burned in a fire inside his garage. I went to the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=273.32s)]
*  Grossman Burn Center and I got a new face. That's a brand new ear. Leno needed skin grafts [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=279.11999999999995s)]
*  and there he is undergoing hyperbaric therapy at the world renowned Grossman Burn Center [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=285.11999999999995s)]
*  in Los Angeles. Tomorrow night, he'll perform at Comedy for a Cause in Hermosa Beach to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=290.2s)]
*  raise money for the Burn Foundation. His thank you for saving his life. We, bro, I'm telling [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=295.5s)]
*  you, like someone has it out for him, dude. Someone wants him dead. Okay. See again, it'll [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=301.16s)]
*  be fine. I'm not worried about it. It doesn't make sense. He also was demonstrated hubris [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=307.36s)]
*  against God. Jay Leno feeling good despite suffering bruised face from fall. So here [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  are some of the older incidents. His badly bruised face was covered in makeup at a charity [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=317.36s)]
*  event. Okay. Former Tonight Show host managed to smile despite facial trauma. Let me explain. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't understand how the hell your nail got ripped off. Like while you're tumbling down a 60 foot baby hill. How the f**k does your nail get ripped off, dude? It makes no damn sense. But it's just weird. His life is weird, man. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. His vibes are so f**king weird. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=326.08s)]
*  Anyway, listen, listen. Leno's hotel fall comes with a string of traumatic incidents that left the comedian injured. He's kept a positive outlook over the past couple of years. He faced several personal struggles, including a motorcycle accident and suffering from third degree burns in a gasoline fire. I got burned in a fire. I got a face full of gas. A spark jumped. It's not like how did this happen? I mean, people get burned every day. He told Fox news digital in October, joking that people had reacted more strongly because he's a celebrity brother. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=356.08s)]
*  It's final destination for you. I don't get it. I don't understand it. Jay Leno has disturbed some really important forces. Okay. It is clear to me that Jay Leno has personally disturbed the old gods. Okay. I don't know if it was because, you know, you, you pissed off Conan and he like, I don't know, went to some Irish witches or something. I don't know if he put a hex on you or I don't know what is going on. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too many. Maybe you like bought one too [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=386.08s)]
*  many cars or something, you know, but and, and, and God was like, it's, you know, bridge too far for me, but I don't get it. Leno noted he was out in eight and a half days in the hospital. Like he's flexing. He's like, that's the other thing. His reception to his injuries. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=416.08s)]
*  And his like freak accidents is always like, like it's always too cheery. You know, it's, it's too positive of an outlook to have where he's like, I'm still alive. I'm still Jay Leno. I got 700 cars. Like it's, it always, it feels as though he is flexing against the powerful, mysterious beings that are trying to execute him. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=432.56s)]
*  In January, he was knocked off his motorcycle. He broke two ribs, two kneecaps and a collarbone. I turned down to the side street, cut through parking and unbeknownst to me, some guy had a wire strung across the parking lot with no flag hanging from it. What? That's not normal. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=455.56s)]
*  Dude, I don't want to, there are some, I feel like there's some powerful forces at play here. This is just crazy. And this is not the last time this happened. He had a crazy car crash. Yeah. Look, this was, this was 2016. It's like he's always cheating death. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=473.56s)]
*  Dude, look at his attitude. His attitude is crazy. Okay. That's what I'm saying, dude, dude, dude. His attitude is actually insane. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=504.56s)]
*  I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't know what is going on with him. I didn't see it until it was too late. It just clothesline me and boom, knock me off the bike. The bike kept going. And you know how that works out in 2022. He went underwent multiple surgeries, suffering third degree burns in a gasoline fire. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=516.56s)]
*  He suffered significant burns to his face and hands as well as his chest while working underneath the car in his Burbank area garage. We need to understand what the fuck is going on with Jason Leno. I don't know what the fuck's going on with Jay Leno. I don't know why. I don't know if he like owes the mob money or something. That's what the, the, the suspicion is the common suspicion is. Okay. I've never met a person that is this unlucky dude at his age. He's like, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=538.56s)]
*  I think he, he just, if there's a finite amount of luck that you can have, I feel like Jay Leno, despite being talentless and unfunny, having like the most insane media career, despite being devoid of talent has now bit him in the ass. Like it's a monkey's paw situation where it's like, you're going to be the least funny late night broadcaster, but you're going to have an insane run. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=569.56s)]
*  And having said that, after the end of your career, you are going to find yourself in the like comically funny, funniest, like physical comedy situations. Okay. For the rest of your life, you're never going to die, but you're going to come very close. You're going to come very close to death over and over again. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=593.56s)]
*  Because like, because the near death experiences that he's going through, like when you're driving a motorcycle and you get clothes lined by a flag, a wired, like that's that's physical comedy. Like technically in an, in an environment that is, is controlled. And like, you're, you know, you're, you're creating that. It's like a cartoonish, it's a Looney Tunes style situation. Okay. It's also the type of thing that would normally fucking kill you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=615.56s)]
*  And it seemingly does not kill Jay Leno taking a tumble because you were a hungy to go to the diner, like taking a tumble also kind of Looney Tunes style kind of cartoonish like Jay, Jay Leno driving in Jay Leno drives directly into a wall because someone had drawn a realistic looking tunnel car explodes. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=645.56s)]
*  Jay Leno has survived yet again. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=667.56s)]
*  Maybe he's just always like drunk. Maybe it just does not make sense to me at all. I don't know how he is like constantly finding himself in these situations. I've never been a fan of Jay Leno, but you know, I wish him well. I hope he doesn't get injured and nobody wants to see. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=675.56s)]
*  Nobody wants to see an old man constantly, constantly in trouble like this and physical trouble like this. So, you know, you also pushed out Carson Conan and Letterman. He definitely has a monkey's paw. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp5aGdQ4Co&t=700.56s)]
