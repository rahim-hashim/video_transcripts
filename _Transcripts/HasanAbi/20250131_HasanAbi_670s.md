# Hasan's New Look
**HasanAbi:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0)
*  Bro, these people are gaslighting you. You look weird. It looks too artificial. Like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=0.0s)]
*  people who do face harmonization and shit. Your instincts are on point. Yeah. Line up [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=4.24s)]
*  the part under your beard, your jawline. It might look better, but you're right. If I [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=8.64s)]
*  was you, I would hate it. I like a natural look so much better. That's it. I just like, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=12.08s)]
*  I'm I prefer a natural look. Okay. That's it. I prefer natural look. And this is a little [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=15.92s)]
*  bit unnatural. And I mean, it's not a little bit unnatural. Everything while I was shaving. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=23.52s)]
*  Is this better, by the way? Please tell me this is better. No, you look more gay. I'm done. You [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  missed some hairs on the left side. Yes. I mean, I had to do this fast while I was listening to the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=43.04s)]
*  DEI. What are you trying to accomplish? You just got to wait until your hair regrows. I mean, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  the beard was annoying me like this. This is too sharp of a line. So having it be like long was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=52.64s)]
*  annoying me. I think it just looked silly. Have you seen the new Amelia press drama? The lead [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=60.56s)]
*  actress has lots of racist tweets. Yeah. Your face is better balanced with your facial hair [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=65.52s)]
*  shave. But I think it's got to, but I think you got to go fully clean shaven to do that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=70.64s)]
*  The girl is, are saying better. So it's better. So once again, going back to what's actually [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=75.28s)]
*  happening in the world, all of this, all of this conversation that revolves around the eyes, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=82.0s)]
*  actually silly, nonsensical, completely ridiculous. People are like, Oh, they lowered the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=88.56s)]
*  standards of eligibility to let in people with like severe intellectual disabilities. And it's like, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=96.0s)]
*  okay. Yeah. Except the, the air traffic control still has a incredibly severe problem with [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=101.12s)]
*  understaffing. Interesting hogs mad R slash conservative users are really not happy with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  the DEI angle. Not the time to do this, to score political points. Let's invest, let the investigators [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=118.56s)]
*  do their job and families mourn. Trump will never not use a moment to political, to promote his [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  political points or opinions, no matter how irrelevant the situation they are. Same old [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=128.24s)]
*  Trump. He can never keep his mouth shut. I mean, one, these guys are still absolutely [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=132.16s)]
*  going to be Trump voters, Trump supporters, whatever. Also y'all so weird, worried about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  looking gay, conservative sounding ass. Oh my God, bro. This man. Oh, my beard looks too [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=142.96s)]
*  sharp and sexy. I'm going to be perceived as gay. Oh no. What a terrible thing. Shaking my head, bro. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=148.0s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, dude. I don't think you understand. I never said that I don't look good with this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=153.36s)]
*  like hairstyle or whatever. It's just not what I think looks good. Okay. That's it. You might, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=157.84s)]
*  you might get, you might go to a stylist and the stylist might put you in like incredibly expensive [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=164.16s)]
*  clothes that they think looks good. Those clothes might be appealing to a bunch of other people, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=169.76s)]
*  but they might not be appealing to you. Okay. One of the things I've always maintained is, is natural. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't get a low taper fade because I like having it look natural. I don't shave my beard down [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=183.68s)]
*  and ever, you know, like, look, there's an angle on my face, dude. Look at this. Like, look, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=190.08s)]
*  you see this? Like that is, is hot for some people. It's just not good for me. That's it. That's all [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=194.72s)]
*  I'm saying. So I'm trying to fix it to the best of my ability. When people say, Oh, you look gay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=200.72s)]
*  They don't mean like, first of all, they're gay. This community is gay. This community is the gayest [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=205.28s)]
*  community on the planet. What the you're talking about? That's why you're gay asses in it. Okay. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=211.12s)]
*  When it's someone saying, yo, you look gay as they're gay and saying that, okay. That's it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=216.72s)]
*  YFN Lucia was released from prison today. Here's a short video. His biggest hit over [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  some Soviet state bus stop as a tribute. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=227.28s)]
*  Dude, why, why over the incredible Soviet bus stops, bro? These people are gaslighting you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=241.12s)]
*  You look weird. It looks too artificial. Like people who do face harmonization and shit. Your [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=254.4s)]
*  instincts are on point. Yeah. Line up the part under your beard, your jawline. It might look better, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=258.0s)]
*  but you're right. If I was you, I would hate it. I like a natural look so much better. That's it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  I just like, I'm, I prefer a natural look. Okay. That's it. I prefer natural look. And this is a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=266.96s)]
*  little bit unnatural. And I mean, it's not a little bit unnatural. It's very unnatural, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=275.28s)]
*  but it's all good. I mean, this is a look for a lot of people. And I'm sure I'm like, I'm not [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=282.96s)]
*  like shitting on the place. You know what I mean? I'm sure they let they, they are helping fix the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=288.24s)]
*  Japanese declining birth rates, like all that good stuff. Okay. That's it. And I think like me, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=293.92s)]
*  obviously washing my face, me washing my face was good. And then me look me washing my face was good. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  Me shaving was good too. I think it helped. Or maybe it made me look more gay. I don't know, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  but whatever too manicured for your taste. Yeah. Just say you don't want to look like [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=317.6s)]
*  us. The F words stop the rationalizing. Yeah, that's what it is. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=322.24s)]
*  What is this? Here's a good analysis. Oh my God. This is 2.9 million views in one day. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=339.52s)]
*  What is happening? Analyzing the mid-air collision over the Potomac detailed examination of ATC [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=348.88000000000005s)]
*  communications, bro. It's so funny. I did, dude. I love my job. I'm the most fortunate person on [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  the planet. I'm so privileged. You guys know this and I love my community, but it is hilarious [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  that I can't even be like, Hey man, I like a rugged look. I like a natural look. I can't like [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=366.24s)]
*  a polished look without chatters being like, wow, I can't believe you're saying the F over [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=372.16s)]
*  and over again to me, particularly to me, just to me. I'm sitting in my living room looking so [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=377.92s)]
*  polished and you have now called me the F multiple times. It's like, no, dude, I'm just saying that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  like everybody has their own preferences. You know, God damn, I can't tell if that dude was [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=390.24s)]
*  joking or not. There's a hell of dudes who are not joking though, in the chat that are like, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=395.68s)]
*  you're using gay as a pejorative. I think we as a community need to understand that there's a reason [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  why a lot of other Twitch streamers think that this place is incredibly hostile. Okay. That's it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=403.28s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. We will never take ownership over it. Of course, especially as a community, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  but like anytime where I'm not in the wheelhouse of talking about politics directly, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=416.23999999999995s)]
*  anytime where it's not just politics, all hell breaks loose, baby, all hell breaks loose. It [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=422.32s)]
*  could be me talking about my hair cut and chat will chat will be in their feelings about it [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  is literally this take time out. The live stream is not working. I don't know why [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=432.16s)]
*  I hear a character say something in a show and, and, and listen to it, hear it back and go, yes, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=435.68s)]
*  that is what they said. And take a pop quiz after the episode, an episode of succession. This is what [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=440.88000000000005s)]
*  he said. This is what this guy wants. This is what this guy probably wants is what he said. That's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  what she said. But suddenly when you get into a real life situation and you hear the words that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=450.88s)]
*  come out of my mouth and I say, you can't just close the department of education. That's a terrible [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  plan. And everyone who hears that who's on Trump's side or conservative, whatever spins around [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=462.08s)]
*  with their head on a swivel, like the bitch from the exorcist and goes, oh, so you think [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=469.28s)]
*  the department education is perfect. You think it's so great. You think it's literally amazing, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=473.68s)]
*  incredible and gorgeous. You literally think it's perfectly fine and should be fixed. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=477.28s)]
*  Babes, that was a completely new sentence. Those were new words introduced to this conversation [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=482.08s)]
*  nowhere. Did that entirely new thought come out of my head that came out of your mouth [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=490.56s)]
*  and I'm yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=497.52s)]

*  a person who is afraid to express themselves in a way that is not in a way outside of the confines [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=534.0s)]
*  of heteronormativity? Also lost their fucking minds over. It was really funny. Yeah. Red pill [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9Xwbunlj0&t=542.8s)]
