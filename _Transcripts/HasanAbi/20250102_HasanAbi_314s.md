# Land Prices In America Are Unbelievable | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw)
*  The only reason why my house is so expensive, especially considering the size of it, my house [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=0.0s)]
*  in most other housing markets would be half the price. It would be maximum. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=10.8s)]
*  What is this? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=22.64s)]
*  The majority, if not the entirety of the homeless population is created because of the housing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=23.84s)]
*  market. There are plenty of people who have jobs, but because the housing market becomes insane, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=29.52s)]
*  they just can't pay for housing. So they still retain their jobs, but they live out of their [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  cars. And it's not about like deporting 20 million migrants or whatever. Like that's not going to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=38.56s)]
*  fix the housing market. It's going to make it worse. Actually, who the do you think builds the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  houses? You know, it's like 25% of the construction industry is undocumented migrants. Good luck. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=45.76s)]
*  Imagine wiping out a quarter of the workforce. You're not building houses no more after that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=51.04s)]
*  And of course, the voiceless poor working class people are the ones who get over in the system [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  because they don't have the same defense mechanisms that a rich person has. Rich people [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=61.28s)]
*  can get together and be like, you're not doing that. They can buy politicians. They can host [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=64.88s)]
*  politicians in expensive dinners and shower them with gifts and become friends with them. They go [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=69.2s)]
*  to the same schools with the people that are in positions of power. Their children work under [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  them. There needs to be a underlying like base level of material equality. What Americans believe [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=79.28s)]
*  we have right now, which we don't have is the equality of opportunity. And equality of opportunity [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=85.36s)]
*  means that like, it does not matter what your background is, but you're getting the best [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=90.64s)]
*  education and you're not constantly desperate for your next meal. That's equality of opportunity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=95.04s)]
*  We can do that. But if we do that, then profits are going to shrink for major corporations and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=101.28s)]
*  we can't have that. There it is. It's green. That's all it is. How should it be free though? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=106.88s)]
*  Not affordable is an necessity on a luxury like a Mercedes or something empty overpriced houses [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=110.56s)]
*  everywhere. Just so the landlords who raise the price of son is 100% correct. His answer is so [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=114.16s)]
*  clear and thought out. Hope everyone's a president. He could surely win. It's not the housing market. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=117.44s)]
*  They have a lot of very deep issues. The housing market that a song contributes to given he lives [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=122.0s)]
*  in a $30 million mansion, giving incentive to make unaffordable houses, 30 million. Okay. People are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=126.16s)]
*  Hassan is dead wrong about corporate profits. Corporations have to pay inflated wages and job [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=132.72s)]
*  hubs to keep their employees housed. They'd make more money without a housing shortage [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=136.48s)]
*  because they could pay less. What I thought. Yeah. My house is now $30 million inflation in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=140.16s)]
*  Los Angeles housing market has gone completely out of control. Just got home from my first [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=148.16s)]
*  colonoscopy, well rested and ready for some fire ass tags. Yeah. It's funny because my, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=153.28s)]
*  the only reason why my house is so expensive, especially considering the size of it, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  my house in most other housing markets would be half the price. It would be maximum depending on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=169.76s)]
*  what year you're purchasing the house. It would be like, it could go all the way down to like [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  $200,000. Right? My house right now in Texas, even in Austin would be maximum [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=182.88s)]
*  500 to $700,000, maybe a million, which is not a cheap house by any means, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  but people make it seem as though it is considered like the house that I currently live in is, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=197.04s)]
*  I think smaller than my grandparents house in New Jersey. And when they bought it, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  when he bought it in like the, I think like the early nineties, their old house in New Jersey, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  when he bought it in the early nineties, it was nothing. It was like 150,000 or something, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  which is still a lot for back then, but it's just like a $3 million house in LA is like a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  200 K house in the Midwest. Yeah. People say like, Oh, your grandparents are rich. I mean, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=233.76s)]
*  I've talked about this before they used to be, but once again, it's funny that you mentioning [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  you have a house enough flex on 90% of us here. It's so funny that this conversation, all of a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=245.12s)]
*  sudden, like people that are currently living in their parents, Connecticut mansion, okay. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  That is significantly nicer and more expensive than the house that I'm talking about in New Jersey [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  are in the chat typing. Wow. Rich grandparents. Like it's, it's so funny to say this because [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=261.2s)]
*  you have no understanding of, of, of what the house that I currently live in looks like [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  and the house that you're currently typing that from, like you're not living people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=273.76s)]
*  People will be living in Ohio in like a compound, basically type in like, wow, rich socialism, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=278.08s)]
*  but it's not on screen. So, you know, in North Carolina, a three story, roughly 3.5 K square [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=285.12s)]
*  feet house is around 350 K to 500 K. If you're not in the big cities like Raleigh or Charlotte, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=291.68s)]
*  if you go there, you will see the numbers minus 1.2 K bought at 126 K five years ago. But at the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=296.24s)]
*  time it was appreciated to around 200 K. You literally had that one guest that said your house [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=302.48s)]
*  ain't no, I've had multiple guests that make fun of me. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_wTB9GUGw&t=306.48s)]
