# I’m Going To DEBATE Ethan Klein | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4)
*  If I were to speculate, I assume that he is going to present himself as simply a person who has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=0.0s)]
*  actively been pro-Palestinian, who has been wronged by vicious anti-Semitic smears online, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=4.8s)]
*  knowing full well that like Sam doesn't know Ethan's full background or the things that he [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=11.28s)]
*  has said and the ways that he's presented himself or any number of different actions that he's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=16.8s)]
*  taken in terms of trying to de-platform pro-Palestinian content creators over and over again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=20.16s)]
*  Anyway, let's blast off, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, and enbies. I think I forgot to do it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=24.08s)]
*  so far. So I'm going to do it right now. Partner, I'm going to do it right now. Partner, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  we'll talk about Texas's insanity. Conservatives jump off the Trump train as GDP shrinks. Since [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=41.12s)]
*  you're blasting off, Chad is trying to tell you about Ethan talking to Sam. Is he, is he talking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=53.36s)]
*  to Sam right now? Cause I will be watching that for sure. Is he already talking to him 4 PM EDT? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=57.28s)]
*  We do not care. No, I definitely want to watch that. Are you out of your dang mind? Also, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=65.68s)]
*  I'm going to be debating Ethan on Friday. So I want to see, I want to see what he, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=71.6s)]
*  uh, what they talk about bomb blast off, love blast off meme candidate. Maybe. Oh yeah. I like [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  this. Hold on. Um, 1 PM your time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll watch it. We'll watch it at 1 PM. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=84.64s)]
*  My time. Will you stream your side chatters? Can I ask you a real question? Do you think that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't live stream my debate with Ethan? Like, are you, are you seriously asking me? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=95.92s)]
*  Are you seriously asking me if I'm going to not go live every day, as I always do for this one [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=102.16s)]
*  specific moment, why would I let him control? Uh, why would I let him control the button or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=108.64s)]
*  the conversation in its entirety? Like the whole purpose of why I wanted to have a conversation [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  with, uh, uh, the, the entire purpose of that's the, why I wanted to have a conversation with [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=120.72s)]
*  Ethan was so that like, he can't manipulate the footage. Like I don't want him to, to, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=125.44s)]
*  I don't want him to engage with me in a disingenuous fashion. I want it to be like all [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=131.44s)]
*  cards are on the table. People are amped because Sam saying won't stream. Yeah. I don't think Sam [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=135.84s)]
*  is streaming his side, but it's okay. Anyway, conservative jump off the Trump train is GDP [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=141.6s)]
*  shrinks Sam Cedar X H three later. Finn peanut raid. Thank you. Finn peanut raid. Thank you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=148.0s)]
*  Finn peanut for the raid. Hope you had a good stream. Are you going to watch the Hassan stream [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=156.08s)]
*  today? Yeah. Don't pause too much. Cause Sam is going to say the same stuff. You say, I know [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=159.68s)]
*  Sam and I are like this when it comes to Israel, ironically enough, like the only thing, the only, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  the only difference is probably our style. He has a much more reserved, much more restrained approach, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=171.12s)]
*  but like, yeah, he gets it. He understands the exact same things that I also understand [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=176.64s)]
*  in terms of, in terms of, of, of Zionism being a failure of a project, you know, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  watching uncle Sam Cedar educate. Yeah. He's more handsome too. I agree. He is more handsome [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  conservative jump off the Trump train is GDP shrinks. Mo's and freed by judge. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=200.72s)]
*  What else? What else? What else? Oh, there's a bunch of stuff that I wanted to, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=211.12s)]
*  of course bring up massive attack defense kneecap. We'll talk about that as well. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=214.96s)]
*  Oh, Texas anti-Israel pledge, anti-Israel sentiment comparing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=221.52s)]
*  the it con to Palestinian resistance movements on the 50th anniversary of Vietnamese liberation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=226.96s)]
*  Those are pretty glasses. Thank you. Oh, ho ho Chi Minh. The Nanny Guski song is stuck in my head. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=243.84s)]
*  Hi, Nanny Gus. No, I don't know what the lyrics are. I keep forgetting, but it's fine. Did you see [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=252.56s)]
*  the Oson account in Netherland? Got that three Yemeni families killed by a smear. Yes, I did see [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=259.12s)]
*  that. I saw the Alden Markey post. I need to learn the lyrics so I can sing that casually, randomly, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=263.84s)]
*  all the time. Which Sam is talking to even today, Sam Cedar, Sam Cedar, uncle Sam, my uncle, real [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=275.44s)]
*  uncle Sam Cedar is talking to Ethan Klein later today. And obviously after that conversation takes [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=282.24s)]
*  place, he's going to have a debate with me on Friday. Wait, he didn't cancel. I know I'm being [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=290.8s)]
*  parasocial here, but there's no chance he will just swap out Dean and effort to get you banned [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=298.32s)]
*  on a technicality. Yeah, he might, he might do that, but I think that would destroy his reputation [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=301.68s)]
*  with the remaining ace unless, I mean, it's a calculation, right? He might be perfectly fine [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=306.8s)]
*  working with like a sex pest who is pro-JAP side, hoping that like his remaining fans who find [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=313.04s)]
*  themselves to be progressive, but like in this very unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=318.88s)]
*  where like they agree with Ethan only in terms of like how they must talk about Palestinian [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=327.36s)]
*  liberation. Like those people, I think will those people, I think would probably look at that and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=331.28s)]
*  be like, that's gross. So like everything Asan said about everything, Asan said about you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=337.76s)]
*  collaborating with destiny was correct. Like what the fuck is that? You know, cause [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  destiny isn't just like a book that you can read. It's like a book that you can read. It's like [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=347.84s)]
*  that, you know, cause destiny isn't just like repulsive because of, but if you back out, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=353.52s)]
*  aren't you worried that he will just call you a coward and notice your shitty thing for him to do, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=359.92s)]
*  but just still thinking about your stream. Yeah. I mean, if he, if he puts up destiny or any other [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=362.72s)]
*  like banned person, I will get banned on Twitch. So yeah, I'm not going to get banned on Twitch [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=368.4s)]
*  just because Ethan wanted to do a troll and I will, you know, I will, I will bring that up [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=374.32s)]
*  and I will communicate that while I'm on his stream as well. But you know, it's, it is what [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=380.64s)]
*  it is. It's not like I'm my, you know, I'll still have a couple of words before I pull out of the, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=388.08s)]
*  I'm more worried about my stubborn nature where I will just like keep going and then I'll get banned. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=393.2s)]
*  I thought Twitch changed that policy. No, it's not. It's different. This is like [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=399.76s)]
*  Twitch changed the policy where you can watch a content creator that's been banned, but you can't [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=403.76s)]
*  literally talk to a content creator directly and have him on your show while they are banned. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=408.4s)]
*  Like communicating directly, directly communicating with a permanently banned streamer is, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=415.28s)]
*  is a big no-no still on the platform. It's just like straightforward ban evasion. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  So, you know, it is what it is, but I wouldn't, I expect some shit like that. I expect some, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=425.76s)]
*  some, I don't know. I expect him to basically try to do something like that to aesthetically make it [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=432.4s)]
*  feel like he made me run away in a similar, like, Oh no, Sam Cedar, what a nightmare style situation. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=439.6s)]
*  So like, I think that he might try to go for like an aesthetic victory because he knows [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=446.0s)]
*  we can't have like a normal conversation without him looking like a fool. It will be bad faith. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=451.28s)]
*  I expect it to be bad faith and I expect him to, I expect him to, to not entertain conversation. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=456.56s)]
*  I'd be genuinely surprised. I would be genuinely surprised if it was like a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=464.32s)]
*  straightforward conversation where he addresses his grievances and then he recognizes that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=469.36s)]
*  he's in the wrong. If I show him my side of things, you know what I mean? Because with [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=477.68s)]
*  the insultment on the side, they just feed him messages and clips. I'm fine. I don't care about [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=481.92s)]
*  that. I just don't, I don't, I don't know. I'm, I'm so stubborn that I might literally just tank [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=485.36s)]
*  the ban if that, if such a thing were to happen. And I don't know what time are you talking to eat? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=490.88s)]
*  Friday, you're going to go debate this dork to enlighten, trying to enlighten an audience that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=497.44s)]
*  already hates your guts and has been open about it for the past 20 months. At this point, he's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=501.36s)]
*  going to talk about swastika sores and bad empanada and random Twitter idiots. And you're going to end [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=504.16s)]
*  up looking like a remarkably clueless person for entertaining this in any capacity. No, I'm going to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  try to keep the conversation focused on Israel, Palestine and what his opinions on Israel, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=512.48s)]
*  Palestine are and how significant of a difference in opinion I have on Israel, Palestine. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=518.0s)]
*  And I'm going to ask him about, you know, some of his positions on the matter, if they've changed [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=523.52s)]
*  or not. And if he tries to, if he tries to fucking constantly talk about how he is the victim of, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=527.6s)]
*  of, you know, CPS calls or all this shit, like I've never entertained any of that. I, I think it's [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=534.96s)]
*  well established what my position is on that as someone who is the recipient of endless amounts [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=541.68s)]
*  of fucking interference in my life from stalker communities and snark subreddits and all the like, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=546.88s)]
*  I would never want that to happen to another content creator. So of course I'm not, I don't [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=553.5999999999999s)]
*  think I'm responsible for any of that shit. So, you know, if he tries to, if he tries to talk about [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  like his own personal victimhood in this process, like, you know, I I'm aware of all the things that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  you guys are aware of. Do you think I'm like that oblivious? I'm not that oblivious, right? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=569.52s)]
*  Yeah. I focus on, I stay in my own lane and I usually talk about politics for the most part, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=573.36s)]
*  but like, I'm not that fucking oblivious. And yes, my expectation is that this will be, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=577.76s)]
*  this will most likely be bad faith. I don't think that it's going to be good faith. Like I don't [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=583.28s)]
*  think he had a genuine change of heart. That would be truly shocking if he had a genuine change of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=588.48s)]
*  heart where he's like, you know what? I want to put this to rest. I want to put this to bed. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=593.12s)]
*  No, I think he has like a ace up his sleeve, but it's fine. It's not something that I'm worried [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=597.36s)]
*  about, you know, why do you think you want salmon before you? My expectation is that he, I think, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=602.64s)]
*  missed, I don't want to talk about it too much. Let's, let's just watch what happens today. I [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=611.52s)]
*  don't know. I don't, I don't know what his expectations from a conversation with Sam will [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=616.08s)]
*  look like, but if I were being, if I were being, if I were to speculate, I assume that he is going [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=620.72s)]
*  to present himself as simply a person who has actively been pro-Palestinian who has been wronged [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=626.32s)]
*  by vicious antisemitic smears online, knowing full well that like Sam doesn't know Ethan's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=632.24s)]
*  full background or the things that he has said and the ways that he's presented himself or any [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  number of different actions that he's taken in terms of trying to de-platform pro-Palestinian [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=643.2s)]
*  content creators over and over again. Like he doesn't know any of that shit. He just cares [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=646.6400000000001s)]
*  about Israel, Palestine. So Sam is going to enter the conversation talking about Israel, Palestine. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=650.8800000000001s)]
*  Ethan will simply say, I'm a two-stater Hassan is a one-stater and he wants all Jews to be [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=655.2s)]
*  assassinated and murdered. And, and, and basically his, I found out that he was like a rabbit [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  antisemite that does propaganda. And, and, you know, he brain, he brainwashed me and he brainwashed [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  my audience into being viciously antisemitic. They said horrible things about, they said horrible [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=676.96s)]
*  things about my wife. They said horrible things about me. They said horrible things about my [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=683.12s)]
*  children. He'll just like make it seem as though I'm responsible for everyone online, including [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=687.36s)]
*  members of his own community that have had a difference in opinion due to the way he has [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=692.08s)]
*  communicated on this issue. So I suspect that he will try to present himself as the real victim [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=696.96s)]
*  here, you know, as a, as a serious victim, as a 40 year old man living in Bel Air, multi-millionaire, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=703.6s)]
*  he's the biggest victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So he will probably try to present [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=708.4s)]
*  himself at the end of the day as a person that agrees with Sam and he'll be like, see Sam Cedar [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  agrees with me. See guys, I'm pro-Palestinian Hassan was wrong. And if he can get something out of that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=723.12s)]
*  conversation where it even looks like Sam Cedar turned around and said something like, yeah, I [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=730.64s)]
*  don't agree with what Hassan is saying on that. You know what I mean? And then he'll take that [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=736.0s)]
*  information and move it on to Friday with a conversation with me where he'll be like, see, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=740.4s)]
*  Sam Cedar disagrees with you. But yeah, we'll see. I think that that is the basics of the plan. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=746.56s)]
*  I just don't know what's going to happen when it doesn't go the way he thinks it's going to go. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=754.56s)]
*  I've got to be honest with you. You have a very low estimate. What? You have a very low estimate [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=759.36s)]
*  of Sam. We wouldn't know. I know Sam very well. What the fuck are you talking about? I know his [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=763.2s)]
*  position is very well. No, Sam is most likely going to stay on the issues. Whenever Ethan brings up [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  like random drama related shit, he'll probably be like, I don't care about any of this. I don't know [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=773.76s)]
*  about any of this. Why are you bringing this up to me? And we'll try to redirect the conversation [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=778.1600000000001s)]
*  back to the issue on hand. No bit. I mean, he's not that naive. No, I know he's not. What, what [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=784.6400000000001s)]
*  are you talking about? Sam Cedar is brilliant. Yeah. He will absolutely try and accept the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=791.04s)]
*  critiques of Israel so we can reframe the conversation. Like we agree on this. Why even [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=794.8s)]
*  discuss it minimizing and avoiding the details of the slaughter and starvation campaign by saying [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=798.16s)]
*  that's bad. I don't agree with it, but he will desperately try to get you to engage on other [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=801.5999999999999s)]
*  topics at all costs. You're correct. Yeah. I think he's gonna, he's gonna have like all the clips out [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=805.04s)]
*  of context to be like, see, this is your boy. He loves Hassan Nasrallah. He said Hassan Nasrallah [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=809.76s)]
*  is the smartest man to ever exist and is the most infallible figure to ever exist. He'll have like [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=815.92s)]
*  a sequence of 10 second clips to be like, he interviewed a terrorist. What's up with that? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=820.8s)]
*  All this shit. And, and then he'll be like, and in the process of this, his vicious rabbit, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=826.0s)]
*  anti-Semitic community sent CPS after me, which is like one of the most insane points of slander, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  I think, which is because like, I didn't even know any of that shit was happening. I don't care about [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  like the, the, the, the reasons as to why or how that took place. I would never in a million years [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=842.4s)]
*  ever entertain that notion. I wouldn't do that to anybody. And I think that's really strange that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=850.72s)]
*  he tried to put that on me. And then it'll be like, Oh, he is a swastika sword, you know? So the issue [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=856.0s)]
*  he has moved far for the past. Wait, what? Let's be real though. The issue for he has moved far [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=861.2s)]
*  past the issue of Israel pass line has become entirely about drama and smears. Oh yeah. No, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=865.28s)]
*  I think it's incredibly selfish. I think it's incredibly and unimaginably selfish to take so [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=869.2s)]
*  much horrifying death and destruction that is happening right now, every single day where [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=874.88s)]
*  Israel's blowing up markets in Gaza, killing 60 people, which used to be newsworthy. It's become [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=879.76s)]
*  such a normal part of the process. It doesn't even make it into the fucking news. Israel's also [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=886.56s)]
*  implemented a starvation campaign right now as we are speaking, where the markets in Gaza are empty. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=890.8s)]
*  People are starving. And, and he wants to talk about how he's a real victim here because he keeps [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=897.2s)]
*  saying shit that's like in defense of this, this practice while simultaneously lightly criticizing [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=902.88s)]
*  it every now and then, or having a tremendous amount of focus on all of those people, myself [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=908.72s)]
*  included, that highlight all of the depravity of the Israeli government engaging in this act of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  ethnic cleansing as, as anti-Semitic, anti-Semitic smear campaigners against the beautiful state of [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=918.72s)]
*  Israel. So that in and of itself is completely unacceptable. That right there is like directly [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=927.28s)]
*  puts you at odds with even a liberal Zionist that knows better and doesn't fucking talk about this [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=933.12s)]
*  stuff anymore because he realizes he's going to look bloodthirsty. So yeah, interested to see if [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=938.4s)]
*  Sam and Ethan discussed, do you have an issue with from the river to the sea? That was the main [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=943.1999999999999s)]
*  breaking point of y'all's post leftover combo. Yeah. That's what I mean. Like this, where is it? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=945.68s)]
*  There's the, there's this video. Ethan Klein explodes in a sputtering rage at the mere suggestion [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  that he is not the world's ultimate victim. The entire room scrambles the reassure and sue them [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=957.04s)]
*  like a spoiled toddler. The shit he said and posted about, uh, Frogan over the past years, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=961.04s)]
*  insanely nasty shit. Yeah. Worse than anyone I've seen. If this is true, absolutely mind blowing, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=968.48s)]
*  insane shit. Hold on. It's not worse than anything you've seen. He was unbanned after 48 hours. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=975.12s)]
*  Anything you've seen worse than, okay. Literally no, I guess. He was very nasty. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=981.04s)]
*  I'm just saying people give people like fucking want to like get laid down. I'm fucking like, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about specifically against Frogan, but like he called her fat, right? And ugly, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=993.92s)]
*  which is horrifically mean. I get called a fucking baby. I was talking specifically about [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=998.4s)]
*  how could you say that? How could you say that? What Frogan experience is way worse than what I [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1004.64s)]
*  experienced on a daily basis. Make sure those guys aware he's coming on your show. Not the other way [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  around. You're the one with the motion. No, truly no gloves. Let them have it. Hold them to account. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1014.08s)]
*  I mean, I don't really care about the petty shit. I just want to have this conversation. And more [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1017.52s)]
*  importantly, I want his audience to actually hear the truth. That is what I care about. Ironically [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1021.84s)]
*  enough, he believes that that's what he wants to do as well to have my audience hear the truth about [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1027.8400000000001s)]
*  the dangerous nature, not realizing that my audience probably thinks I'm fucking not radical [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1033.04s)]
*  enough. You know, half of the half of this community thinks I'm a pussy for not running around [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1039.2s)]
*  constantly and just like, I don't know, flying the banners. Okay. So I don't know why he thinks [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1046.3999999999999s)]
*  that I don't know why he legitimately and unironically thinks that like people are going [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1053.2s)]
*  to fucking be like, wow, I can't believe it's on offered analysis and context to why resistance [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1057.28s)]
*  militancy exists against fucking genocide and blowing the shit out of every neighboring country. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  I can't believe he said that. Oh no, the horror. Like, does he not realize that these are my point [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1070.32s)]
*  that I've said on my stream with additional fucking statements on top of that. I don't know why he [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1076.4s)]
*  thinks that my audience is going to be like, wow, this is a bridge too far. What's next? Are you [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1081.76s)]
*  going to say that you have Marxist Leninist tendencies? How dare you first and being called [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1086.08s)]
*  fat and ugly in my opinion. Sure. Not yelling at you. I am yelling at you. I don't really understand [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1091.76s)]
*  what the point is. Yeah, you're trying to make it because I get frustrated when everybody's like [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1097.28s)]
*  trying to defend her so much. It's like she's the ultimate victim of online harass. She is, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1100.24s)]
*  isn't infinitely, she has been victimized in infinitely worse ways than Ethan could ever [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1105.04s)]
*  imagine. Ethan is so not victimized that he has to fucking invent ways of being victimized to create [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1110.32s)]
*  drama surrounding it. And the reality is when Ethan creates drama around his own personal [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1116.96s)]
*  victimization, people actually tune in that actually works for him. Frogan on the other hand [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1122.32s)]
*  is constantly and consistently fucking smeared and by the most bad faith, most rabid sociopathic [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1128.32s)]
*  figures online. Okay. God, it is so funny. It is so funny how like Israel coded this is, you know, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1134.32s)]
*  constantly on the defense, constantly self victimizing, constantly escalating and being [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1142.96s)]
*  an infinitely more powerful figure in the conflict. Like obviously there is a very different, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  there's obviously no moral equivalence between what Israel is doing is fucking genocide. Right. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1155.76s)]
*  But like in terms of the propaganda aspect of it all, it just like it literally is the same [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1160.64s)]
*  shit that Israel does. So frustrating. It's like people are nasty to her. I'm pointing out how [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1167.2s)]
*  weird it is for Idubs to reach out to him specifically. That's why I'm saying that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1174.0s)]
*  Right. I'm not comparing. It's innovative. Idubs to reach out to who? Tech Tone? I don't think [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1178.4s)]
*  Idubs reached out to Tech Tone. The fuck? You should look into watching the Gaza Ghetto Uprising [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1182.16s)]
*  on stream. It was even made by a former Israeli. Yeah. God. Bro, wasn't it you who said platforming [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1185.92s)]
*  big is as bad yet you're letting Ethan farm you for views. Wait, I thought a song was upset. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1191.8400000000001s)]
*  Isn't that what Ethan said last week, bro? Wasn't it you who said platforming big is as bad? Yes, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1195.76s)]
*  brother. There's a difference between platforming bigots and then also fucking like having a [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1199.8400000000001s)]
*  conversation for clarity, having a conversation that creates clarity in the minds of people in [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1206.4s)]
*  his audience that are absolutely amenable to my position if they were to hear what I actually have [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1211.92s)]
*  to say. I would be truly shocked if his entire community is completely swapped into like a drama [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1217.44s)]
*  slop tube alt-right adjacent commentary. I think there's a lot of girly pops that still watch Ethan [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1223.52s)]
*  and still see Ethan and Hila as their comfort characters, not realizing that like they have [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  also fallen down this like weird pathway of radicalization in the opposite direction. And [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1235.52s)]
*  I think those people can actually be convinced. Those people can actually change their minds if [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1241.2s)]
*  they see the fucking full picture. Anyway, I know what I'm doing. Please trust me. That's it. Nah, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1245.92s)]
*  the girly pops are doing insane Islamophobia now. I know, but you know, I know what I'm doing. Let [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1251.2s)]
*  me fucking do my thing. Okay. This point like y'all have to trust me a little bit on this, right? You [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  have to trust me a little bit. Okay. You did the same thing with Andrew Tate. You were like, don't [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1262.56s)]
*  do this. Don't do this. Don't do this. It's going to be bad. And it was like, never mind. It was [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1267.68s)]
*  actually pretty good. I'm glad that it happened. And it's the same. It's the same when I tell you [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1271.04s)]
*  like, it's good if the Democratic Party actually turns around and starts criticizing this administration [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1276.16s)]
*  for its ridiculous deportation policies, because that will get the media to pay attention to it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1281.52s)]
*  And then inevitably, once a big fuss is created around it, like people's positions will change. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sS-JG84Zp4&t=1287.68s)]
