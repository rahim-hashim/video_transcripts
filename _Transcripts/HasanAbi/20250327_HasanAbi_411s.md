# Is "The Rookie" Copaganda? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg)
*  But the point I was making, the point I was making was the cop runs back, okay, on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=0.0s)]
*  rookie show. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=7.92s)]
*  Rich privilege of the mile? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  The entire society is designed to privilege the rich. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  That is literally what is the whole point. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=13.1s)]
*  Rookie episode starts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=21.76s)]
*  This is the last episode of the rookie. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=23.48s)]
*  So if you watch it, you've probably seen this already. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=24.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=27.92s)]
*  Rich privilege of the mile? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=28.92s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=29.92s)]
*  The whole point of the rookie show is, you know, doing their regular rounds, right? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=30.92s)]
*  They're on patrol. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=33.56s)]
*  His lieutenant or whatever tells him, there's a guy, this one's your case. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=34.68s)]
*  You're going to handle this case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=39.88s)]
*  The case in and of itself is simply that some douchebag in Los Angeles has parked in a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=41.44s)]
*  red zone to grab a cup of coffee. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=48.56s)]
*  Who amongst us? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=50.92s)]
*  Who amongst us hasn't done that? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=51.92s)]
*  Cops pull up in front of them, also in the red zone, get out of the car. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=53.88s)]
*  They say, Hey, sir, you can't park here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=57.48s)]
*  The guy goes and he's an asshole. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  The person that they're talking to is an asshole. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  He goes, what do you mean? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=65.52s)]
*  I can't park here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=66.52s)]
*  I'm just getting a cup of coffee. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=67.92s)]
*  I'm going to be a couple of minutes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=69.12s)]
*  I'll be, I'll be out of your way in a second. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=70.8s)]
*  He goes, doesn't matter how long the stay, you can't stop in the red zone. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=72.32s)]
*  So then the asshole character says exactly what I think and sometimes we'll say to cops. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=77.36s)]
*  He goes, Oh yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=86.68s)]
*  If I can't park here, why can you park here? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  Why are you allowed to park in the red zone? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  And the Sergeant goes, what are you going to do about it? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  Rookie. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  So the rookie takes the cop car and drives it all the way up the hill and parks it in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  an appropriate parking spot. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  He runs back to a Sergeant and right at that moment they get a call, an emergency call [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=109.12s)]
*  because danger is afoot at a moment's notice. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  And the Sergeant says, you won't say shit to them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=122.2s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  You have never, you've, you have not seen me around cops. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  I, this is something that I've talked about before, but it's kind of, it's, it's, I'll [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  give you a kingdom come deliverance example. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=137.88s)]
*  If you have high enough, like nobility, if you have high enough charisma and you're wearing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=140.56s)]
*  noble garb, when the city guards come to you, you can just be very stern with them and they'll [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=145.68s)]
*  say, Oh, sorry. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=150.76s)]
*  Like if you say, Oh, who do you think you're talking to? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=151.76s)]
*  I'm nobility. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=154.8s)]
*  And the guys will be like, sorry, sir. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=155.8s)]
*  I did. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=157.8s)]
*  I mistook. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=158.8s)]
*  I mistook you for someone else. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=159.8s)]
*  There is a, in my personal experience, there has been like an attitude shift in the way [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=161.7s)]
*  that law enforcement treats me from when I was dead as broke to the situation that I'm [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=168.6s)]
*  into, the financial situation I'm in now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=176.06s)]
*  So no, you're wrong. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=178.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  If you are, if you are rich, if you are at least like presenting yourself as rich and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  if you know, you know, if you know how to talk, cops are permanent bootlickers because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  they ultimately know that you're the guy who's paying their salary and that they're like, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  they're conditioned to thinking, Oh, well, I have to protect this guy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=200.68s)]
*  He's rich. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=202.84s)]
*  I swear to God, I can't. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=203.84s)]
*  And also I'm, you know, I'm not, I'm not black or brown presenting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=205.36s)]
*  So that's the other side of this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  We're like, I'm white enough to be able to get away with it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=212.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=217.38s)]
*  So there's that now this doesn't mean that they're not going to you up, you know, depends [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=219.12s)]
*  on it depends on, you know, what kind of day the cop is having, but I've, I've, I've been [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=224.84s)]
*  able to dice roll and pass the skill check numerous times at this point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=230.72s)]
*  Anyway, but the point I was making, the point I was making was the cop runs back. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=236.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=244.04s)]
*  On the rookie show, rich privilege of the mile. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=245.04s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=247.42s)]
*  The entire society is designed to privilege the rich. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=248.42s)]
*  That is literally what is, that's the whole point. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=250.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  Rookie comes back, they get a call. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  Now he has to run back and grab the car. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=257.92s)]
*  And that is a very secretive, dare I say, cynical way of doing copaganda because it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=260.54s)]
*  tells the viewers, it tells the viewers, this is why cops have to park in red zones. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=269.4s)]
*  It tells the viewer two things. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=275.6s)]
*  One, this is why cops have to sometimes violate the rules by parking in the red zone because [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=277.38s)]
*  danger is always afoot. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  And the second thing is to politely, gently nudge the gently nudge the viewers in the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  direction of understanding that danger is always around and cops are there to protect [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  you from said danger. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=299.8s)]
*  This is how the copaganda works. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=300.94s)]
*  Because if it was just like deliberate overt annoying and they were like, cops are awesome [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=302.84s)]
*  and they save you and they protect and serve shut the f**k up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  Like that would be impossible to, you know, that would just not be good content. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=309.74s)]
*  That would just not be good content. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=314.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=315.74s)]
*  What was the emergency? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=316.74s)]
*  Someone getting shot by a cop? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=317.74s)]
*  No, the emergency was something insane. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=318.74s)]
*  Like the shows are psychotic, by the way, especially rookie. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=321.14s)]
*  The rookie show is psychotic because like they just straight up Merck a convict, like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=326.0s)]
*  the police precinct in the episode that I watched, they shot and gunned him down. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=332.56s)]
*  He like one of the convicts that they're like a walking through the bullpen randomly attacks [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=336.24s)]
*  a dude who's like weirdly enough singing in the middle of the bullpen about how like, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=341.74s)]
*  why are we arresting everyone? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=348.92s)]
*  You know, did you deserve to be in prison or, you know, were you a victim of circumstance [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=351.84s)]
*  or did you deserve it? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  Cause you're a bad guy or that kind of s**t. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=361.84s)]
*  And then one of the guys like just, you know, chases him and attacks them cause he's a random [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=362.84s)]
*  psycho. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=368.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=369.08s)]
*  So the rookie is grazing enemy, but cops. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=370.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=372.84s)]
*  Have you watched blue bloods? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=373.84s)]
*  Craziest cop again of all time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=374.84s)]
*  So many television shows that are still around and very popular are copaganda. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=376.24s)]
*  That's when you realize like, oh s**t, that's why like anyone over the age of 40 is like [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=381.44s)]
*  ready to die for the police force. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=389.24s)]
*  Regardless of the you've all day stuff, like they literally think cops are actively protecting [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=390.24s)]
*  and serving, you know? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=395.34000000000003s)]
*  But yeah, it's awesome. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=397.12s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  I, I loved it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  I love copaganda shows. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=402.64s)]
*  But yeah, that's what I did. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8Cy-U5BRg&t=404.84s)]
