*  has indeed sites in Iran I want to go to Elena Trane who is there at the White House [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=313.52s)]
*  Elena just to back up for a second this news coming that they have attacked three sites there [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=320.08s)]
*  in Iran as we saw President Trump coming back to meet with his national security team there at the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  White House as we saw these B2 stealthers that were involved in this being mobilized earlier what more [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=331.44s)]
*  are you learning as we get this brand new information yes we do know that the president [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=338.64s)]
*  is still currently inside the west wing with his national security officials we saw CIA director [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=344.08s)]
*  John Ratcliffe enter the west wing just a little over an hour ago secretary of state Marco Rubio we [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  just spotted moments ago outside of the west wing on the phone engaged in a in a phone call and look [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=354.24s)]
*  I mean so far all we know is what we have seen the president post of course this is very different [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  we've been hearing in recent days that he was still weighing this decision well despite that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=366.24s)]
*  two-week deadline that he gave just two days ago he has now of course made that decision moving [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=371.12s)]
*  forward with this series of strikes I think very notable you know I was in some conversation with [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  folks who are wondering does this mean the US when he says we well he thinks I don't even know [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  American warriors in this saying that no other military in the world could have done this some [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=384.8s)]
*  other things I think very much worth emphasizing here Jessica is he says that the were dropped on [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=390.88s)]
*  the primary site fordo of course that was really what we had been hearing in all of our conversations [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=395.52s)]
*  that really only the United States these b2 that you mentioned we had reporting that had left that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=400.4s)]
*  Missouri Air Force Base yesterday they were the only ones that could really penetrate fordo that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=406.32s)]
*  site to really help the Israelis in their ultimate goal of wiping out Iran's capabilities he says [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=411.76s)]
*  that they have done that of course and strike two other now will this be like a custom sudamani [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  moment of restraint from Iran and not even restrained at that point it's like complete [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=421.76s)]
*  and utter domination or does Iran retaliate against American troop positions in the region [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=426.08s)]
*  and and close off the straight of hormones into this in a far more offensive way than we have seen [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  and also kind of going against some of what we've also known as many people [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=439.52s)]
*  really wary of the United States getting involved in this some key things I think [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=443.12s)]
*  though are also important to note here Jessica is what I had heard in my conversations after we had [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=446.32s)]
*  reported earlier this week that the president had reviewed attack plans on Iran I was told that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=450.24s)]
*  behind closed doors in these conversations he had asked his team specifically if there was a way [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  to have the United States carry out some of these strikes without launching them into a prolonged [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=460.8s)]
*  war I've been told repeatedly in my conversations here with White House officials that the their [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=466.0s)]
*  goal was to see even if they get involved in this perhaps that does not necessarily mean that the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  United States is getting involved in a war or that this will make it a full scare war of course [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=475.6s)]
*  we have to see how the Iranians will respond to this but that has been what I've been told in my [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=479.92s)]
*  conversations here at the White House and Elena just to give people against the tweet that's in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  Hebrew is somehow going to tell us Israel knew about this all along wow do color me surprised [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=489.6s)]
*  brother what a shocking development meanwhile he was trying to pull he was trying to pull the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  ayatollah to Turkey or some shit or the foreign minister to Turkey right if Israel's wants to get [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=503.52s)]
*  rid of any threat of Iran having a weapon and getting rid of that program how do you achieve [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=509.52s)]
*  that goal and the big question around that was whether the U.S. would get involved because as [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=516.0s)]
*  you mentioned the really the key way to do that is with these with these bunker buster you need [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=520.64s)]
*  these b2 stealth in order to do that now the Iranian or the Israelis had said they had contingency [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=526.24s)]
*  plans but they certainly wanted the U.S. to step in here and help them offensively the U.S. had been [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=532.0s)]
*  helping them defensively trying to protect them as a long way straight was do what do you mean [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=538.64s)]
*  you shut off the shirt of hormones the entire world's the entire world's oil production collapses [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=545.12s)]
*  not the entirety of it but a big chunk of it that's exactly right I mean and and you're right I do [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=552.96s)]
*  think stepping back and looking at how we got here is so important I would note as well of course that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=556.64s)]
*  one the president has been saying for months even before he took office that he believed that the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=561.28s)]
*  Iranians could never have a weapon that the ultimate goal was to find a way to prevent that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=566.4s)]
*  they're already they're already packaging that was really what we've seen this administration do which [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=571.12s)]
*  is try to engage in negotiations with the administration ready to bring ready to collapse [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=575.36s)]
*  the entire globe but instead a peaceful demonstration of restraint a first strike that was necessary [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=582.0s)]
*  what a psychotic what a psychotic country we are strike Tehran and then of course those strikes [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=590.24s)]
*  began just over a week ago and if you look at where the president has been at first he really [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=596.08s)]
*  was saying that he wanted to find a diplomatic solution to try and de-escalate the conflict [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=600.64s)]
*  between Iran and the Israelis and essentially had said that he needed the Iranians to be far more [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=606.16s)]
*  forthcoming in those talks and really make major concessions what they had really been unwilling [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=612.0s)]
*  to do up until that point and then he gave himself that two-week deadline on Thursday where [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=618.32s)]
*  he said I will make a decision even though we had been reporting up until that time that he was more [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=622.96s)]
*  he was closer to wanting to involve the U.S. militarily than he had been but now we it is [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  clear of course that he has made that decision ordered the military to strike these three [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=633.36s)]
*  different facilities specifically fordo again which you pointed out is really the key one that a lot [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=637.5200000000001s)]
*  of people believe that the United States needed to be involved in and your point as well about what [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=642.72s)]
*  the Israelis have been asking the president they've said it publicly we know they have been saying [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=646.96s)]
*  this privately in their conversations they wanted the United States get involved this is exactly [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=651.0400000000001s)]
*  what they were hoping they would do a key question now is where does this go from here and we're [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=655.6s)]
*  going to have to continue monitoring that to see exactly what this could lead to now that the United [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  States is far more involved in this directly than they had been up until this point certainly all [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=664.48s)]
*  right Elena train with the very latest at the White House thank you for that again the breaking [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=668.4000000000001s)]
*  news president Trump saying that we have completed our very successful attack on three nuclear sites [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=671.52s)]
*  in Iran we have special coverage of this breaking news continuing right now with Anderson Cooper who [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=676.8s)]
*  is live in Tel Aviv Anderson chatters this is one day of traffic in the Strait of Hormuz through the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=682.88s)]
*  Strait of Hormuz of oil tankers cargo vessels it is a tremendously important choke point [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=691.5999999999999s)]
*  that Iran stated they would start mining if they were attacked look the calculation here is simple [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=699.52s)]
*  as I said either the either the Trump generals are correct and Iran will behave in the same way [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=707.28s)]
*  that they did after the Qasem Soleimani assassination but this is a severe escalation beyond that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  beyond that this is exactly what Israel did to the Palestinians for 75 years basically not in the same [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=724.4000000000001s)]
*  severity obviously but like this is a show of force that says you will not negotiate with us we will [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=731.84s)]
*  not negotiate with you as even partners we are here to dominate you just as the Abraham Accords [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=737.6s)]
*  basically proved to the Palestinian population that there was no other way out of this that they [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=744.4000000000001s)]
*  were backed into a corner and they had to fight their way out of it this is another escalation [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=748.88s)]
*  from the American from the American government and the Israeli government that their goal here [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  is complete complete subservience from the Iranian government they are no longer a sovereign nation [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=760.64s)]
*  from this point on is basically what they are saying they have their airspace they were they [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  use the diplomatic talks as a protective cover to basically blow up these facilities now we don't [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  know that strike the question as you said how many runs did it take were they able to destroy it [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=782.64s)]
*  completely you know we don't know that yet we don't have that battle yeah we don't know if they [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  actually were successful but Natanz facility according to the IAEA and others that did that [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=793.28s)]
*  was damaged by Israeli authorities that was damaged early on in Israel's actions against Iran the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=799.76s)]
*  exact level of damage was not clear there were some initial reports that perhaps the damage was [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=807.52s)]
*  worse than it actually was the the electrical supply to the centrifuges at the Natanz facility [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=811.76s)]
*  were cut with that that electrical supply was cut I spoke to the head of the IAEA who said he believed [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=818.56s)]
*  that that would have caused some of the centrifuges in that Natanz facility to spin out of control [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=825.2s)]
*  and probably go offline and be damaged but again it seemed like Fordo wasn't had not really been [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=830.4000000000001s)]
*  directly hit as far as we know that's right the Israelis had primarily focused their attention on [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=835.76s)]
*  the Natanz facility we know that they had done extensive damage to the above ground facilities [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  some damage to the below ground facilities and then as well some damage to Isfahan as well although [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=845.5200000000001s)]
*  they left a lot of that untouched some of that according to experts who I've spoken to may stem [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=851.36s)]
*  from the risk of radiation that could heavy GPS jamming and disruptions are being recorded right [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=856.96s)]
*  now throughout Iran and across other areas of the Middle East likely part of tonight's US strikes [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=863.6s)]
*  against Iranian nuclear facilities as well as the preparations for a possible response by Iran [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=867.2s)]
*  US to you from Phil Stewart national security reporter for Reuters USB2 bombers were involved [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=871.28s)]
*  in strikes on Iran's nuclear sites US official tells Reuters this is the liberal media talking [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=876.72s)]
*  about this by the way mother of all bombs which is in Afghanistan that bomb is actually not the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=882.08s)]
*  mother of all bombs if you consider the gbu 57 because it is smaller than this 30 000 pound bunker [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=887.6s)]
*  busting bomb which would every expert has said would be the bomb that you would use for the [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=894.08s)]
*  Fordo facility at this stage we don't know what China and Russia do now I mean it is the fact [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  that this happened probably means that China and Russia the weapon of choice maybe I'm wrong but [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=905.44s)]
*  the fact that this happened feels as though China and Russia allowed it to happen if that makes [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=910.96s)]
*  sense like I don't if they if they saw Iran as a valuable partner a valuable enough ally I doubt [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=916.96s)]
*  that they would allow Iran to get bombed they would probably intervene far before this took place if [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=924.8800000000001s)]
*  that makes sense like I don't think America can move b2 bombers into Iran and fly over [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=931.2s)]
*  Iranian airspace and blow up Iran when there are Chinese assets in Iran there are Russian assets [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=937.12s)]
*  in Iran well notice they didn't actually bomb the Russian facility the Russian nuclear facility was [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=944.08s)]
*  untouched they will intervene now I think it took everyone by surprise it took everyone by surprise [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=948.6400000000001s)]
*  so why is a dumbass 33 year old twitch streamer who is simply looking at the the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=954.0s)]
*  readily available reporting on it telling you that it was going to happen literally this weekend [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=961.12s)]
*  because I read seymour hersches reporting on it which was almost entirely correct there is no [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=966.56s)]
*  world in which if I am speculating on something and telling you that this assessment has a high [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=971.76s)]
*  likelihood that the Chinese state is oblivious to that reality or rather the Russian state is [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=979.68s)]
*  oblivious to that reality that's not how states work many of you don't understand that like states [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=986.0s)]
*  literally engage in deconfliction when they literally do war with one another even okay they [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=990.88s)]
*  communicate they communicate flights to one another I'm not saying that the b2 bombers were [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=997.92s)]
*  communicated ahead of time to Russia and China but I would be shocked if they didn't you did just say [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1003.3599999999999s)]
*  that on Thursday dumb shit my whole point is first of all there is no congressional approval [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1007.6s)]
*  they are basically behaving as though if it's a bombing campaign it doesn't require like just [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1014.4s)]
*  with Yemen just like Yemen if it's a if it's a bombing campaign it doesn't require congressional [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  approval is like the modus operandi now okay this has been calcified as a as a fixture of American [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1025.44s)]
*  foreign policy okay congressional approval basically is negligible and not necessary when [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1031.92s)]
*  it comes to bombing campaigns at most if you want to do probably like a like a full-blown boots on [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1037.68s)]
*  the ground military campaign then you have to maybe say then you have to maybe say like oh there's [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  going to be a special military operation not a full-blown invasion and then maybe you can exhaust [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1050.24s)]
*  the legal limitations once again this is a severe severe escalation this is a severe escalation an [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  act of aggression against a sovereign state directly going to war with Iran specific Israeli [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  leadership and Israeli advice in the series of a war Russian American air forces communicated their [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1070.24s)]
*  flight paths with one another to make sure no accidental shoot down on the other this is [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  something that the great powers did since the cold war to prevent escalation and nuclear war exactly [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1080.9599999999998s)]
*  Iranian nuclear facilities America does not give a about anything dude we do not care about anything [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1085.84s)]
*  we are so awful we are so goddamn awful it is crazy the constitution international law break it [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1093.4399999999998s)]
*  if we want to and you can't do a damn thing about it that is precisely what's going on here now we [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1103.76s)]
*  wait for the retaliation will Iran actually pull a custom Suleimani post-customs Suleimani [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1110.32s)]
*  assassination and their response is entirely so limited that it's basically nothing it's negligible [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1115.4399999999998s)]
*  or will they actually retaliate with severe force basically saying it's over it's all it's it's you [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1123.12s)]
*  know all systems go we're going to blow up every American base with ballistic missiles we're going [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1131.28s)]
*  to mine the Strait of Hormuz we're going to disrupt we're going to disrupt commercial sea [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1137.52s)]
*  traffic and and and this is their their final step for this is their final desperate last [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1144.8s)]
*  ditch attempt at sovereignty the problem with this the problem with the final last ditch attempt [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1156.16s)]
*  at sovereignty is that it will turn it most likely will lead to extended conflict with America [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1162.56s)]
*  and with Israel and it will most likely lead to the inevitable demise of the country that we know [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1171.44s)]
*  the United States of America if that goes if it goes in that direction and it will be used as a [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1176.48s)]
*  proxy by China and Russia if they are clever enough to extend that conflict in the same way that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1181.84s)]
*  America was using Ukraine against Russia the difference of course between Ukraine and Iran is [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1186.8s)]
*  that Iran has designed his entire society to withstand this kind of thing if push came to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1193.2s)]
*  shove they've never used it and I don't even know if if push comes to shove they will be able to use [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1199.44s)]
*  it but we shall see what happens Trump just tweeted a OSIN account Fordow is gone says open [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1205.84s)]
*  source intel this is so stupid I'm sorry what the I can't take this seriously open source [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1213.12s)]
*  intelligence the OSIN 613 account doesn't know if Fordow was actually gone well you can anticipate [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1221.52s)]
*  that every intelligence gathering like what are we talking what is this why is he posting this [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1227.52s)]
*  does this mean he directly is saying that Fordow is gone is now focused you are the president man [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1232.9599999999998s)]
*  what the is going on I don't know if this is a a re-truth because he is saying yes I saw it [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1239.2s)]
*  or if he's just simply a moron and is retweeting an OSIN account to flex I don't know I don't even [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1250.8s)]
*  know if they have the capability of knowing if Fordow was gone how would they be able to know [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1256.72s)]
*  if Fordow was gone even Americans do they have the surveillance technology to figure out like [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1262.96s)]
*  did they monitor to craters how would they even figure out it's in the side of a goddamn mountain [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1269.04s)]
*  intercepting their communications whether it's digital or whether it's voice [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1275.68s)]
*  to get some sense of what happened down there but you're absolutely right you probably will only get [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1280.48s)]
*  a 10% answer to that question I would not want to be the target tiers in the bomb damage assessment [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1287.2s)]
*  teams that now have to turn to the president and say we got it we didn't get it or we didn't get [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1293.92s)]
*  it enough what likely there will be a need for a re-attack what Iranian tv saying no attack has [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1299.76s)]
*  been done no one in comm or isfahan reported hearing anything what the is going on all the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1308.5600000000002s)]
*  Iranian media is sleeping right now okay what about Fordow though I mean I know that that's [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1312.0800000000002s)]
*  like far away the only way to possibly figure out and this is I mean Fordow is the enrichment [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1316.4s)]
*  facility okay Fordow is the enrichment facility so I assume that if it was like a successful [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1323.28s)]
*  strike maybe there would be radiation right Iranian Twitter saying they cannot confirm the attacks [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1332.56s)]
*  there is no confirmation confirmed information yet regarding the nuclear facilities which are [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1340.96s)]
*  subject to tight security and media protection weak communications do not necessarily mean the [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1344.8s)]
*  attack was successful and we are working to verify the details as quickly as possible [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1348.56s)]
*  okay that's a little different that's the that that doesn't mean that it didn't happen [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1352.88s)]
*  there are 40 000 us troops in the middle east right now and any lingering faith that Iran [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1359.28s)]
*  plus allies in Iraq Yemen etc had in Trump's deal making instincts is now shattered hard to see Tehran [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1363.68s)]
*  agreeing with Trump that peace will now come more likely they perceive an all-out war for regime [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1368.56s)]
*  survival women Iran tv says they don't know yet so you guys so people in Iran have internet right [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1373.2s)]
*  now I assume Trump's set to address later Trump's truth social account has been disabled what the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1379.36s)]
*  is going on bro CNN brings on a guest to say he's impressed with Trump's use of deception and [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1386.1599999999999s)]
*  trickery liberal media by the way of this announcement by the president the decision to act [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1391.6799999999998s)]

*  military and civilian ties and of course the state department have been advising any American [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1586.8799999999999s)]

*  I would say in terms of foreign policy this is the most important most significant moments [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1598.24s)]
*  of president Trump's second term with Ian panel for us thank you very much we're going to bring [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1603.52s)]

*  believe with us and one thing I just wanted to ask you about because we were getting these reports [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1613.6s)]
*  from flight tracker sites earlier that these B2 bombers were on the move we thought that they [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1617.9199999999998s)]
*  were moving according to sources toward Guam what do we know about what may have changed in [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1623.2s)]
*  that plan and was this part of some sort of diversion or what was it that led to this move tonight [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1628.88s)]
*  but those are all great questions we're trying to get to and get a real good handle on that but [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1636.4s)]
*  you're exactly right this is a very public tracking on flight tracker websites on radio [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1640.56s)]
*  communications from air traffic controllers that indicated that these B2s had left their base in [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1646.24s)]
*  Whiteman Missouri and were bound westward we talked to officials who told us that yes the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1651.76s)]
*  bombers were headed to Anderson Air Force Base in Guam which is a place that they've deployed from [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1657.04s)]
*  in previously and but that there were no further orders so the question is were these B2s allowed [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1661.76s)]
*  to continue on towards Iran and striking some of these targets were they not used what other kind [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1668.96s)]
*  of assets may have been used one of the things that I think that has been lost here over the [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1676.0s)]
*  last week or so is that the United States has had a very strong military aerial presence in the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1680.24s)]
*  region already we knew that the additional fighter bomb fighters and bombers were have [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1686.56s)]
*  been surged into the area but those aircraft are very capable with it of dropping including the one [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1691.68s)]
*  where he announced that this had happened in the last 15 latest one well as you said he announced [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1697.52s)]
*  he will address the nation at 10 p.m tonight so that's in two hours time just under two hours [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1704.6399999999999s)]
*  time he says i will be giving an address to the nation at 10 p.m at the white house regarding our [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1710.6399999999999s)]
*  very successful military operation in iran this is an historic moment capital letters an historic [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1715.52s)]
*  moment for the united states of america israel and the world iran must now agree to end this war [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1721.04s)]
*  thank you so two hours before he gives what i imagine will be an oval office address [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1727.76s)]
*  to the nation very unusual for an address to the nation to come so late in the day [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1734.4s)]
*  and at the weekend when presidents tend to do this it's usually early on in the evening hitting [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1738.8s)]
*  prime time six six p.m or so but a 10 p.m address to the nation we also know that the house the [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1743.68s)]
*  speaker of the house and the look the only the only other possible outcome is that that twitter [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1750.8s)]
*  guy was also saying is that they actually did not did not successfully hit the facility like they [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1756.64s)]
*  did not reach the facility um given how deep it is and therefore and and therefore the iranian [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  retaliation will still be severe i suspect but not as severe as like all-out war so we shall see [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1774.72s)]
*  yeah and this was a question that was raised when i was having these conversations in israel today [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1782.72s)]
*  with israeli officials they said that one of the things that donald trump would be asking was what [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1789.1200000000001s)]
*  does the next day look like what does tomorrow look like what does it look like in a week the [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1795.3600000000001s)]
*  international atomic energy agency is in tehran the pros the radiation on site if strike was [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1798.88s)]
*  successful yeah prolonged situation so as you say and as ali's do you think this would have happened [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1803.1200000000001s)]
*  if trump wasn't elected not that it matters because donald trump is currently the president [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1809.12s)]
*  but yes i do think it would have happened if trump wasn't elected as well if you think that [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1813.04s)]
*  the democrats would be any different right now than the trump administration then you're not [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1817.36s)]
*  paying attention to what the fucking democrats have been saying so far now once all of these [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1821.52s)]
*  events unfold and we see the negative consequences of it the democrats might finally change their [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1827.28s)]
*  fucking tune but leading up to this leading up to this very moment the democrats have been lockstep [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1832.24s)]
*  have not actually moved away from criticizing donald trump and the only time where they've [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1837.76s)]
*  offered criticisms to donald trump is when they're actually saying they would bomb iran harder [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1841.92s)]
*  and this is not just the words of kamala harris saying that iran is the biggest enemy that she [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1849.76s)]
*  would be harder on iran than donald trump or that how she wanted to have the most lethal military [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1854.0s)]
*  this is not just what they've said during the campaign this is not how they set the stage for [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1859.36s)]
*  this to take place this is because of what the democrats are saying currently the democrats are [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1864.72s)]
*  currently saying the highest level democrats in congress right now are currently saying that [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1871.52s)]
*  donald trump has the right to do this they should just do it the legal way by getting [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1878.24s)]
*  congressional authorization that is basically a demand for rubber stamping this and doing it [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1883.04s)]
*  the legal process that is not a criticism of donald trump doing this at all at most if you [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1888.32s)]
*  hear the in the upcoming days if you hear from democrats they will probably say depending on [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1894.32s)]
*  the impact depending on the retaliation you will probably hear them yell about how donald trump [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1901.04s)]
*  did not follow process that's not the real criticism here that's a the process is only [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1907.2s)]
*  important because you're supposed to use the process to stand in opposition to donald trump [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1913.44s)]
*  and you're not supposed to give him the congressional authorization donald trump went ahead and did it [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1917.92s)]
*  anyway without congressional authorization i built a live viewer of satellite verse thermal [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1922.64s)]
*  hotspots and fire activity and kiss me hot sauce all over iran i can get you a web map of the [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1930.64s)]
*  specific data if you want to look there'll be a great deal of satisfaction within the israeli [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1935.44s)]
*  if dems had control of uh executive in congress don't you think they would try to reinstate the [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1942.4s)]
*  jcpoa we had a democratic president for 12 hours since fordo's opening uh and no bombing ever [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1945.8400000000001s)]
*  happened then not running d for the ds but do i do feel like this degree of escalation could [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1951.6s)]
*  only ever happen under donald trump joe biden literally was joe biden was the president [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1955.04s)]
*  joe biden was the president and chose not to reinstate the jcpoa [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1964.08s)]
*  way [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1967.6s)]
*  and instead what joe biden did was instead of instead of reinstating the jcpoa [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1978.7199999999998s)]
*  what he did was fill till genocide and set the stage for donald trump to be able to do this [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1990.08s)]
*  that's why brett mcgurk has been joe biden's architect in the middle east what brett mcgurk [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=1995.6s)]
*  has been saying on cnn 24 7 is basically how awesome this stuff is that trump is doing israel's [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2000.8799999999999s)]
*  channel 12 is showing images from what they say is fordow the vegetation isn't in the image does [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2006.0s)]
*  seem to match the area around the site apparent footage from iran according to n12 news who i [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  don't know if this is i don't know if this is real we would not be at this terrifying moment without [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2017.28s)]
*  biden and his team emboldening netanyahu beyond even israel's expectations in gaza and lebanon [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2022.24s)]
*  abandoning hopes of a renewed nuclear deal and fracturing their voting coalition a team that [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2026.0s)]
*  promised stability brought huge danger this assessment is correct it is and you know i keep [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2029.76s)]
*  on saying it can go one of two ways not that it matters right now guys the i i it doesn't matter [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2035.36s)]
*  currently okay it doesn't matter what to coordinate it does not matter what uh you know kamala harris [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2040.48s)]
*  would have done if she was president right now it literally doesn't because donald trump is the [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2047.84s)]
*  president and he did this okay something bigger i mean the iranian regime but as you know if you [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2050.96s)]
*  come to me and you ask me a question because this one i'm probably going to be honest with you [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2056.96s)]
*  they will be aware they will be aware of the pounding they've taken over the last week in a bit [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2060.4s)]
*  and they will be aware of the huge risks of getting into a big war with america now [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2066.56s)]
*  and so i think there is and we have seen it before um in the last couple of years i think there is a [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2071.92s)]
*  scenario whereby not necessarily coordination but they maybe even take a little bit of time [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2080.24s)]
*  and they make sure that some dude on twitter saw two b2's flying east over his house in missouri [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2087.4399999999996s)]
*  last night lamau the only one who saw the real strike that is very much signaling an off ramp [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  rather than rather than an escalation now the scenario a real real scenario that they say [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2099.2799999999997s)]
*  we're going to widen this conflict they i'm not sure how it yes never forget [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2106.24s)]
*  sigh hersh papa hersh was right unfortunately but he was 100 correct in his reporting [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2112.08s)]
*  example he suddenly start to really disrupt the global economy they could brett mcgurk on [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2118.0s)]
*  santa endorsing it oh me well this will perhaps uh completely put to bed the notion that the [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2124.0s)]
*  democrats will be behaving differently right now brett mcgurk is joe biden's own middle east guy [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2131.36s)]
*  his envoy okay is this effing what's happening right now and he's on cnn let's see regional [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2138.32s)]
*  leaders and to iran that this is it this is about the nuclear program this is not an expanded [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2144.4s)]
*  campaign uh they still want to get back to the path of a diplomatic uh uh arrangement which has [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2150.88s)]
*  been on the table for some time um so that is the message i think we're likely here from the [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2158.08s)]
*  president at 10 o'clock um they are prepared for a potential iranian response i would put it in [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2162.96s)]
*  three categories we know them well uh missiles militias and terrorism or hostage taking uh but [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2167.7599999999998s)]
*  i think we have as i understand it uh both sent a warning to iran not to think about that [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2173.52s)]
*  and if they do we would have a counter trying to avoid going up that ladder there will be a lot of [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2179.52s)]
*  diplomacy here tonight it's not going right now what diplomacy this is about your what are you [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2183.76s)]
*  talking about it does not go on from here am i crazy have i lost my mind am i the crazy one [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2188.32s)]
*  what do you mean diplomacy oh i can't wait to do diplomacy this is a great opportunity for [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2196.0s)]
*  diplomacy that's the dumb shit that trump is saying what do you mean you're supposed to be [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2202.48s)]
*  the serious party you guys are supposed to be the harvard educated foreign policy advisors [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2207.1200000000003s)]
*  fluidity today everybody talking back channels i was talking a lot of my former counterparts [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2211.6s)]
*  trying to find some opening and press upon iran like look guys take agree to sit with the americans [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2217.8399999999997s)]
*  and and sit down on the deal that they presented six weeks ago and there was just no opening uh [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2223.7599999999998s)]
*  from the iranians so in any case uh i can't believe this is what fucking bullshit we were [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2228.88s)]
*  watching when very i know this operation iran too down to the t i am fairly confident it was [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2233.68s)]
*  quite successful on those three sites but in any case the message now going out is that this is it [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2239.44s)]
*  uh and this can be the ceiling of this escalation and try to get a deal i say one more thing [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2246.16s)]
*  anderson you mentioned last night's a little counterintuitive but there are talks ongoing [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2251.92s)]
*  hamas is sending a delegation to cairo to talk about a ceasefire in gaza which is extraordinary [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2256.88s)]
*  in the backdrop of this arrangement and those who are working on that believe there might be [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2262.56s)]
*  an opening to actually get a ceasefire in gaza which is desperately needed so there is some hope [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2268.56s)]
*  here some hope uh that this is my least favorite type of i told you so coverage where like some [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2273.84s)]
*  de-escalation on the where where the the goal here is not to take out iran's nuclear enrichment [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2280.56s)]
*  facilities the goal here is to have a either completely non-sovereign completely servile state [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2287.6s)]
*  or most likely it's not even that it's just regime change and if you can't do regime change [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2295.04s)]
*  then complete destabilization of iran a country with 92 million people in it oh my lord [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2300.56s)]
*  so again iran can do missiles malicious terrorism we know what they try to do they are incredibly [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2310.08s)]
*  degraded from what we had assumed but we have to see where this goes but i just want to that's [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2316.8s)]
*  what i've heard from a senior officials involved in this those are the message going out to the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2322.08s)]
*  iranians and to regional officials and i think we'll hear more later tonight [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2326.24s)]
*  i just want to reiterate i mean you have an extraordinary record of service you have heard [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2333.44s)]
*  from a senior official the the details on on this which you've just given to us and that the u.s [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2339.52s)]
*  has sent the message to iran that this is essentially one and done [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2348.64s)]
*  no it's no further from the u.s as long as nothing else further on happens is that correct [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2353.92s)]
*  the objective of the mission are the three nuclear sites that's the objective [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2359.84s)]
*  and so if everything stops here that's it if iran tomorrow i don't think they will [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2364.24s)]
*  but if tomorrow they come and say okay let's sit down i think there's a path to an agreement [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2371.04s)]
*  look these sites will eventually be rebuilt in some way they can be rebuilt in a way that allows [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2376.56s)]
*  iran to have a civil nuclear program i do not think iran will ever again have an enrichment program [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2382.0s)]
*  because you dude you're on we have today they have no defense and i doubt the israelis are going to [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2386.16s)]
*  permit the iranians to be rebuild an air defense network so it's a it's just a totally different [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2391.68s)]
*  middle east than we have assumed even two years ago but iran has capabilities it's missiles [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2397.2s)]
*  malicious terrorism and they're going to have some some choices to make anderson but bottom [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2403.52s)]
*  line yes that is a message going out tonight diplomatically trying to say this is what this [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2408.08s)]
*  is about this is not about regime change against something you and i have been talking about [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2413.12s)]
*  this is not about regime change it's about your nuclear facilities should have taken the deal you [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2417.2s)]
*  didn't this is where we are it can stop here or it can escalate and the objective through that [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2421.84s)]
*  diplomacy is not to go up that escalation ladder to try to stop it here but you know this is look [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2427.12s)]
*  this is a incredibly serious moment i think that diplomacy has to be active engaged from all sides [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2434.08s)]
*  our allies our partners even those who might not agree with this decision trying to ensure we do [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2443.12s)]
*  not go up that ladder but if we do i'm fairly confident that you know sentcom has prepared [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2448.3199999999997s)]
*  our own counters should that happen [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2454.48s)]
*  brett use your judgment on what you can't say but i just want to ask [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2459.6000000000004s)]
*  how confident can u.s officials be air force everybody else be about the the level of damage [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2463.2000000000003s)]
*  is sufficient enough particularly at the ford o facility are they able to do real-time assessments [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2471.92s)]
*  of or does that require you know repositioning satellites and and that's going to take [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2478.48s)]
*  some time before there's an accurate sense of how damaged these facilities are based on this one [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2485.44s)]
*  thing i'd say about this operation we know a lot about it so this is not like a a new situation a [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2490.96s)]
*  new target uh i don't want to say too much but i think our our commanders they knew exactly what [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2497.84s)]
*  to target what to hit the pilots so that's that's one thing but yes there will be over the coming [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2505.76s)]
*  hours as light comes up there will be battle damage assessments to determine the success [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2511.92s)]
*  but i think right now they believe it was very successful based upon what was practiced and [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2518.7200000000003s)]
*  rehearsed over many years i have to you know the the massive ordinance penetrator is ammunition [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2522.88s)]
*  that back in the obama administration used to be discussed a lot as we have that option should it [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2529.0400000000004s)]
*  ever come to that well it's really air force is not going mobile this is a military mission [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2534.0s)]
*  that has been honed across administrations with the hope that it would never have to be used now [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2539.92s)]
*  tonight it has been used but this is something that has been rehearsed practiced uh for years [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2545.12s)]
*  across across presidencies so i think they knew exactly what they were doing [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2551.84s)]
*  and feel good about the results but i think yeah they will do an assessment probably tomorrow [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2557.68s)]
*  over the coming days make sure if you have to go back and hit again something else that i've i've [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2561.76s)]
*  been involved in that in the past that could be a possibility but again the message here going out [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2567.28s)]
*  to the region in toron this is about the nuclear facilities this is not an expanded mission set [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2572.32s)]
*  that's what this is about and and it can stop the reason why he's even entertaining the notion of [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2578.0800000000004s)]
*  second strikes yeah the video is old it's not ford al um despite what many accounts are now claiming [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2582.7200000000003s)]
*  this video is old and not from tonight's u.s strikes against the four down nuclear facility [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2589.28s)]
*  nor any of the strikes tonight against iran um but that doesn't mean that ford out hasn't been [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2593.0400000000004s)]
*  struck but as it stands currently we don't know how deep the penetration was we don't know what [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2598.2400000000002s)]
*  kind of damage the nuclear facility took okay we don't know that we do not know this is an important [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2607.44s)]
*  part of the calculation to make assessments on what the iranian retaliation is going to look like [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2615.44s)]
*  okay that's what's important i mean there's a million different things happening right now [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2621.84s)]
*  but we do not know we do not fucking know what iran will do in retaliation they said ford i was [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2627.68s)]
*  not burning as of now here are all fire signatures on earth by nasa firms yeah also notice how brett [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2636.4s)]
*  mcgurk goes oh it's about it's about uh nuclear sites but also israel won't allow them to rebuild [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2641.84s)]
*  their air defenses yeah it's about not being not having sovereignty that's what it is that is [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2648.48s)]
*  precisely the reason why they wanted to take out the nuclear facilities not because they're [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2653.44s)]
*  terrified of a nuke that iran might get or iran has or whatever israel is claiming it's about [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2656.56s)]
*  not allowing there to be a sovereign iranian state they will either immediately try to implement a [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2663.04s)]
*  puppet state that will be incredibly unpopular and people will resist against it or they will [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2670.4s)]
*  just destabilize it and turn into a fail state that narrative of israeli special forces rating [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2674.96s)]
*  forda was the most obvious fictitional narrative i've ever heard but at least now i know it was [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2680.32s)]
*  almost certainly just a bait to get as many on the ground soldiers in the facilities before the [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2684.8s)]
*  u.s bombed them probably spread by israel to try and maximize the response from the iranian side [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2688.8s)]
*  and bait the u.s in the further conflict iranian official wait is this actually from an iranian [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2692.48s)]
*  official or is this just like some dumb account breaking islamic republic of iran state media [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2698.08s)]
*  says the three nuclear sites bombed by the united states had personnel evacuated some time ago they [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2702.64s)]
*  already moved the enriched uranium from fordow as well to a secret facility they had already [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2706.64s)]
*  covered that but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you here is what the the senate majority [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2712.16s)]
*  leader john thune said the regime in iran iran which has committed itself to bring in death to [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2718.3199999999997s)]
*  america and whapping israel off the map has rejected all diplomatic pathways what do you [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2722.4s)]
*  mean they've rejected all diplomatic pathways to peace i'm losing my mind i feel like these guys [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2725.84s)]
*  are just like wish casting an alternative vision of what unfolded in broad fucking daylight and [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2730.08s)]
*  honestly the media is going along with it the media is not even offering even a fraction of the [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2737.2000000000003s)]
*  truth mainstream resources for the past week have been salivating at the prospect of american [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2743.04s)]
*  american bombers doing exactly what they just did tonight [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2750.08s)]
*  what kind of insanity what kind of insane world are we living in where mainstream resources [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2754.48s)]
*  are basically salivating liberal republican alike at the prospect of bombing a sovereign nation state [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2760.96s)]
*  and his nuclear facilities while there was a denuclearization negotiation going on [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2768.88s)]
*  and they kept saying come on come on get back to the table as they kept bombing who would believe [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2773.52s)]
*  this who would believe this who would ever take mainstream resources seriously ever again how many [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2779.44s)]
*  outlets how many outlets you guys there's 75 000 people in here okay i covered extensively how [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2786.56s)]
*  these facilities were most likely going to be struck this weekend i covered seymour hersh's [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2794.56s)]
*  reporting i looked at all of this analysis i warned against how devastating this would be [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2799.52s)]
*  be how many mainstream resources did you hear this kind of information from how many of them [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2804.4s)]
*  even had a single person this past week come out on television and say what the are we doing what [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQ-fySolw0&t=2811.2000000000003s)]
