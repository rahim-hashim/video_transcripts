# Bernie Sander On Us-provided Military Equipment | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k)
*  But like as the number one Bernie Stan, knowing that he lived in the kibbutz at a certain point in his life, I think like that kind of brought this issue close to home to him in a very emotional way that I think changed his that I think it changes analysis a little bit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=0.0s)]
*  Talking about Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=25.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=26.0s)]
*  Finally, finally on it. It's just senators back in session. What do you mean? He's been doing this. He's done this since October seven chat. Come on. I've been in school. The issue is he's done this before. He's done this way before October seven and he's done this since October seven. There are issues that I have with the way Bernie communicates this problem, specifically because he knows better and my expectations are much higher than him from him than anyone else. Both. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=56.0s)]
*  Not only as a, you know, living, breathing socialist senator, but also as a Jewish man, a Jewish American who ran for president, who was out flanking everybody else on the issue of like what to do with Israel far before October seven. My expectations are significantly higher from him for these reasons. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=86.0s)]
*  Ultimately, he's still infinitely better than Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, but that doesn't really mean anything. Who cares if he's Jewish? What do you mean? Judaism in its long history and its cultural aspects is incredibly revolutionary. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=110.0s)]
*  Mike. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=127.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=157.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=179.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=187.0s)]
*  President, I think he's talking about Kamala Harris, who is the leader who's presiding over the Senate resolutions of disapproval. That's who Madam President refers to. $20 billion in vice president. The vice president presides over the Senate. He's speaking to her. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=209.0s)]
*  The president of the Senate Congress has the block on sales, which are inconsistent with established US and international law. It's not her right now. It's probably someone else. But on these measures. But that's how you refer to the outline briefly why it is critical that we prevent these sales from going forward. Madam President. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=223.0s)]
*  I have laid out the horrible reality of the situation. But the sad truth is that much of this carnage has been carried out with US provided. It could also be Patty Murray, the current president pro tempore. Patty Murray Washington equipment. Put simply, it's probably probably not Kamala Harris. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=246.0s)]
*  To continue this disastrous war would be immoral. It would also be illegal. These sales directly contradict the stated purpose of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act. These laws require that US arms transfers to foreign countries must be consistent with internationally recognized human rights. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=270.0s)]
*  Advance US foreign policy interests and avoid US complicity with any human rights violations. That is the purpose of these laws. Madam President. During the August recess, the administration sent the Congress official notice for several sales to Israel that clearly do not meet these criteria. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=299.0s)]
*  The arms sales total over 20 billion and include transfers of joint direct attack munitions or JDAMs, 120 millimeter tank rounds, 120 millimeter high explosive mortar rounds, medium tactical vehicles and up to 50 new F-15 fighter aircraft, as well as upgrades for some of Israel's current F-15s. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=323.0s)]
*  All of these systems have been used in causing massive death and suffering to innocent men, women and children. The JDAMs and 120 millimeter tank rounds in particular have been used and are responsible for a significant portion of the civilian population. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=344.0s)]
*  But do you think the attitude changed? Bernie's attitude on Israel didn't change. He's just a liberal Zionist and I am frustrated by how much further he should be taking his rhetoric at this point. But this is like normal for Bernie. Everyone that says this is like new or unique hasn't been paying close attention to what Bernie is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=363.0s)]
*  Hundreds of high witness testimonies, photographs, videos and satellite imagery all underscore one simple point. These are being used in violation of U.S. and international law. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=380.0s)]
*  I have a list here of some of the most egregious incidents involving these systems. Tragically, the list is too long for me to read here on the floor. But Madam President, I ask that this list be included in the congressional record. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=396.0s)]
*  He's more than a liberal Zionist. You're right. You're right about that. Time without an OVO. You're giving liberal Zionists a lot of credit by calling him that. I agree. He goes above and beyond. He's not just a liberal Zionist. But he definitely still has that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=411.0s)]
*  All I'll say is he's not okay. That's it. He's not. He's not. Ofer Kasif is the difference. Dr. Ofer Kasif is a member of the Israeli Knesset. He is an A. Look at the way that he communicates on these issues versus the way Bernie communicates on these issues. And you will recognize. Having said that, however, yes, if every Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single, if every single Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single, if every single Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single, if every single Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single, if every single Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single, if every single Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single, if every single Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single, if every single Democrat had this position, that would end [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=426.0s)]
*  Absolutely. If every single Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single Democrat had this position, that would end. Absolutely. If every single Democrat had this position, that would end. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=456.0s)]
*  If every single Democratic party member had Bernie's opinion and Bernie's courage and communicated what was going on in Israel in the way that he does, then, you know, there would be no more apartheid Palestinian here. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=468.0s)]
*  have said, despite being like Benjamin Netanyahu's primary opposition, Yair Lapid comes to mind when I think of like liberal Zionism. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=482.0s)]
*  have said, despite being like Benjamin Netanyahu's primary opposition, Yair Lapid comes to mind when I think of like liberal Zionism. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=487.0s)]
*  Okay. Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, will openly be like what Israel is doing is unconscionable. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=490.0s)]
*  They're doing work and the ICC and the ICJ are good. So he definitely goes way above and beyond. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=496.0s)]
*  He doesn't just like single out Benjamin Netanyahu. He does single out Benjamin Netanyahu regularly, but he doesn't stop there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=501.0s)]
*  He is on the spectrum. He is closer to than like who you would consider to be a liberal Zionism normally. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=506.0s)]
*  He is on the spectrum. He is closer to than like who you would consider to be a liberal Zionism normally. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=507.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders has time and time again called in the question of our undying loyalty and positive leadership over Israel. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=514.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders is on the spectrum. He is closer to than like who you would consider to be a liberal Zionist normally. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=517.0s)]
*  Okay, that's very important to understand pre October 7 pre October 7 a lot of you found out about the brutality not the Palestinian chatter but like many Americans found out about the brutality post October 7. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=534.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=545.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think October 7, especially the the the the attacks on the kibbutzim broke him a little bit straight up. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=546.5s)]
*  That's what all that's my assessment. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=555.1s)]
*  I don't know what is in anyone's mind, but like as the number one Bernie stan knowing that he lived in the kibbutz at a certain point in his life. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=556.8s)]
*  I think like that kind of brought this issue close to home to him in a very emotional way that I think changed his that I think it changed his analysis a little bit because his statements. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=568.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean he was getting outflanked by AOC dude. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=581.5s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=584.0999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  The reason why I say this you will never see a liberal Zionist voice criticism with IDF conduct on moral grounds. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=586.3000000000001s)]
*  You don't even see that from the Zionist left. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  They'll mention strategic issues here and there but they never dare show pictures of the destruction. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=592.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, you're talking about liberal Zionists in in Israel and design is left in Israel versus liberal Zionism in America like liberal Zionism in America will say like oh the settlers are awful and oh well, you know, there's like definitely design is left. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  Yes, there is a thing in Israel. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=614.0s)]
*  Okay, some National Socialism going on. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=616.4s)]
*  Yes, probably more so than anywhere else. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=620.1s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=622.9s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=624.5s)]
*  Dudes who are like liberal Zionist in America. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=626.2s)]
*  No better than to let anyone know their Zionist to be honest like AOC chat AOC has called what Israel is doing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=628.4s)]
*  I am not going to have this conversation with you because you're hyped up. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=634.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=637.1s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=638.2s)]
*  AOC is outflank Bernie Sanders consistently on the issue of Israel get the out of here. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=639.0s)]
*  I don't care to have this conversation with you over and over again. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=644.5999999999999s)]
*  It is it is so ridiculous, dude. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=648.3s)]
*  Just analyze the situation adequately AOC has a lot of awful positions on this throughout this conflict. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=651.3s)]
*  Okay throughout this but if every single American politician or a decent number of American Democrats maintained AOC's position on the matter. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  This would be a very different conversation. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=667.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=669.5s)]
*  Holy moly like everybody hyper focuses on our saying lying and saying that the Democrats are working tirelessly for a ceasefire, which is a ridiculous thing to say and forgetting all of the other day. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=670.7s)]
*  She says in terms of like calling it what it is a there's like four people in Congress that have done. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=683.9s)]
*  So, okay, you guys are on the one hand. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=689.0s)]
*  You just made them more angry boss. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=693.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=694.7s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=695.4s)]
*  I know they have a hyper fixation. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=695.9s)]
*  They have a hyper fixation and they don't understand like the things that you say the things that you say American Congress person will never say. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=697.8s)]
*  Okay, what good does calling it a do now if it does no good? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=707.6999999999999s)]
*  Why won't other American politicians do it if it doesn't move the needle at all? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=711.6s)]
*  You just moved your shit about Israel around their parents that are getting lump in their throat tired of this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=715.9s)]
*  Yeah, only those who are not sure of themselves can fear to enter into temporary alliances even with unreliable people not a single political party could exist without such alliances. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=720.0s)]
*  Lenin 61% of Americans opposed sending supplies to Israel including 77% of Democrats 60. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=731.5s)]
*  She's younger. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=745.0s)]
*  She also sometimes like has a radlib tendency like the difference is, you know, she'll hyper focus on like optics and whatnot on certain instances. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=746.1s)]
*  So I think it's shocking in a situation where like someone who is that optics focus will just come out and straight up be like Israel's doing it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=756.8s)]
*  This has to stop that right there is that's that's it for me as the biggest voice on the left. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=764.4s)]
*  Shouldn't you voice against some influence on the left that obviously have some personal vendetta since the FDV and attack on others on the left for example, I don't care. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=770.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=777.2s)]
*  When people that repeat those statements come into the chat, I'll yell at them. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=779.2s)]
*  That's it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=783.5s)]
*  How about accountability TLDR? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=783.9000000000001s)]
*  Jojo and I wants you to start drama with Brie Joy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=785.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really give I don't care to do so. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=787.8000000000001s)]
*  All right, let's get back to Bernie. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=791.6s)]
*  Threatened to withhold 10 billion dollars in loan guarantees. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=793.2s)]
*  Unless Israel stop settlement expansion. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=797.0s)]
*  In other words using arm sales in military aid as leverage is not a new idea done on the Republican presidents Democratic presidents. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=800.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=811.5s)]
*  There is also recent precedent of Congress acting to stop your civilians in 2019. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=812.5s)]
*  Congress passed a series of JRDs to block arm sales to Saudi Arabia over its campaign in Yemen. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=818.2s)]
*  At that point the Saudi coalition was directly responsible for roughly 8000 civilian deaths over four years. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=825.6s)]
*  Mostly from air strikes. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=833.4s)]
*  Israel has 41,000 in less than a year. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=835.0s)]
*  But a president blocking these sales but also being keeping with actions taken by the international community and some of our closest allies. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=838.4s)]
*  So what I'm suggesting here is not unique in the world taking place all over the world including some of our closest allies. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=847.7s)]
*  There has been widespread condemnation of Israel's conduct during this war from governments around the world international institutions and humanitarian organizations. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=856.5s)]
*  The United Kingdom recently suspended 30 export licenses for a range of armaments after concluding. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=868.0s)]
*  There was an unacceptable risk they could be used in violation of international humanitarian law. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=875.6999999999999s)]
*  Germany has not approved an offensive transfer since March Italy Spain Canada Belgium and the Netherlands have taken similar steps. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=882.1999999999999s)]
*  United Nations bodies have called for an end to the arm shipments fueling the conflict. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=893.6s)]
*  Madam President we cannot ignore continue to ignore what the extremists Netanyahu government is doing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  We cannot continue to be complicit in this humanitarian disaster. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  The time is long overdue for the US Senate to act and we must act. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZrLPRPsr7k&t=914.8000000000001s)]
