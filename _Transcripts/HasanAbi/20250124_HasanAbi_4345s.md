**HasanAbi:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0)
*  So you're want to build the same house you will have no the same house that burned down [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=0.0s)]
*  I just this is what I'm I'm truly worried about this like the fact that they're the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=5.18s)]
*  fact that they're talking about like rebuilding the same houses in the area that was completely [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=12.84s)]
*  wiped out is insane like you have to fireproof it somehow man. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=17.72s)]
*  I've heard all my coworkers conservative co-workers talk about it they agree it's a Nazi saluting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=23.64s)]
*  the very concern they're very confused why it happened. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=31.28s)]
*  I also do think that like I also do think that like Elon is is maybe a little too foreign [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=37.36s)]
*  for American sensibilities and American taste like yeah if you're one of these like blue [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=45.32s)]
*  enclave city Republicans that oftentimes are more groper adjacent in their politics and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=51.459999999999994s)]
*  like way grosser than the average normal is Republican living in like Alabama or whatever [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  that's victim to social conditioning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=64.22s)]
*  You will like Elon Musk you're around other people like Elon Musk but if you're like a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=69.34s)]
*  like a regular ass conservative dude in Arkansas and you see that unless you are also a part [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  of the American near see places like this you're going to look at that and go no that's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=80.5s)]
*  like a weird foreign guy who's you know definitely doing a Nazi salute. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=85.02s)]
*  And every one of them said to me they want to rebuild I said will you go elsewhere no [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=89.94s)]
*  no no no it wasn't even like a question they love the area they love the people that it's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=94.3s)]
*  like a family it's incredible actually when you see some things like that we just left [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=100.7s)]
*  North Carolina and we had just a similar type of disaster it was water instead of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=105.9s)]
*  fire but boy that water did damage like I've never seen before and then you come here and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  you see this but the people are so amazing and your fire department no no no every one [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=118.06s)]

*  areas and it is devastation it's incredible it's really an incineration even some of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=180.54000000000002s)]

*  they want to come in they don't want anything they just want to come in and help and they [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=455.34s)]
*  really know how to get things done and get things built I would ask that the local officials [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=458.38s)]
*  because we're going to wave just about essentially wave all federal permits we're going to have [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=465.02s)]
*  you go very quickly because a federal permit can take 10 years we're not going to do that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=470.18s)]
*  we don't want to take 10 days I would so we're declaring this a national emergency [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=475.62s)]
*  by doing that I can give you immediate like immediate permits I'd ask that the local [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=487.7s)]
*  permitting process be the same some of the people were saying they're going to have [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=493.7s)]
*  to they're going to be forced to wait 18 months for their permits and I don't think you're [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=498.18s)]
*  going to do that I can't imagine that so they are literally in a position right now [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=503.02s)]
*  they'd like to start tonight and they'll they'll clean their site they'll do everything [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=507.38s)]
*  they just want to start and they were very concerned with the 18 months so I'm sure [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=512.14s)]
*  you can get it down to I would say not even 18 days they are ready mayor they are ready [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=517.02s)]
*  to start there I met so many of them the fire took place it's nice and cool there now and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=524.06s)]
*  and they want to start taking the debris they want to take the debris they want to do everything [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=532.06s)]
*  they'll get rid of everything they're going to do it by by their own hand and you're [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=536.02s)]
*  going to see some amazing things happen so we're waving the federal permits either wave [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=541.2199999999999s)]
*  them or give them to so rapidly it's not going to it's going to be essentially the same thing [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=545.9799999999999s)]
*  but we're going to try and just wave them and we'll rely on the local but the local [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=550.0999999999999s)]
*  I hope is going to do the same exact thing they're literally ready to start right away [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=554.7399999999999s)]
*  tonight so if you could do almost the same thing or the same thing would be great for [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=559.5799999999999s)]
*  building permits you're going to have to you know check things out a little bit a lot of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=565.14s)]
*  them every single one of them said they're going to rebuild I didn't have one person [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=568.14s)]
*  say they're selling or they're leaving or they're disgusted they love their community [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=573.02s)]
*  and it's incredible we even had one from your neck of the woods right you want to stand [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=578.66s)]
*  up it was so nice the way you think she greeted she greeted my wife in a very different in [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=584.94s)]
*  a very different language right and it was very nice to see and you're staying and you're [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=594.62s)]
*  going to rebuild and everything else yeah everybody everybody so it's really great so [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=599.98s)]
*  I'm signing an executive order to open up the pumps and valves in the north we want [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=604.94s)]
*  to get that water pouring down here as quickly as possible let hundreds of millions of gallons [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=611.14s)]
*  of water flow down into southern California and that'll be a big benefit to you if look [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=616.34s)]
*  if you don't want it you're going to tell me but just I can't imagine it I tell you [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=622.3s)]
*  who does like it is the fire department when I said that they were very happy with that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=627.78s)]
*  they didn't mind hearing that but we have a lot of water that is available and I hope [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=632.06s)]
*  you can work that out among yourselves but I think this will show that we we have to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=639.0999999999999s)]
*  have that water we have to have that water you're talking about unlimited water coming [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=644.42s)]
*  up from the Pacific Northwest even coming up from part and it pours down naturally it [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=649.54s)]
*  has for a million years for a million years it pours down you'll never run out you'll [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=656.2199999999999s)]
*  never have shortages and you'll you won't have things like this and when you do you'll [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=660.9s)]
*  have a lot of water to put it out so I'm going to ask that you figure that out but [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=665.86s)]
*  I am I really strongly recommended this seven years ago and I think I'm going to just do [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=671.26s)]
*  it if you have big problems you're going to let me know but I just can't even imagine [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=679.98s)]
*  it but we're also surging federal resources and assistance to the state and California [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=685.02s)]
*  must adopt the common sense policies to prevent fires and we all know that you know we were [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=692.5799999999999s)]
*  talking seven or eight years ago I was talking to people from Austria people from Finland [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=698.42s)]
*  live in forests one of the gentlemen the top one of the top great leaders of Austria [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=713.98s)]
*  said we don't have forest fires that we have trees that are actually far more flammable [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=720.62s)]

*  anything they talk about the delta smelt which is a fish that's this big but it is it is really not [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1666.56s)]
*  doesn't have to be protected because it's in other areas it's in numerous other areas so [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1672.6399999999999s)]
*  it doesn't have to be protected the people of California have to be protected [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1677.76s)]
*  Mr. President [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1684.56s)]
*  Mr. President Mr. President could I just speak for a moment Kevin Kiley California first of all [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1685.28s)]
*  you're absolutely right about the Coastal Commission I've introduced legislation to rein them in we've [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1693.76s)]
*  been talking with Rick about this they're out of control absolutely out of control it's insane the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1697.76s)]
*  things they've been getting away with I think they thrive on it actually I know that it's so [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1702.16s)]
*  ridiculous that's right they even tried to stop SpaceX from launching rockets it's it's true [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1705.84s)]
*  but you mentioned your predecessor and how he didn't fix the situation which is absolutely right [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1710.88s)]
*  not only that during the Calder fire which was a few years ago which was in my district [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1715.28s)]
*  600 people lost their homes in a town called Grizzly Flat he came and he promised that he [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1719.3600000000001s)]
*  would help them out but he broke that promise many times he never delivered them the individual [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1724.0s)]
*  assistance they were asking for so this has underscored for me the importance of helping [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1728.88s)]
*  the victims making sure in this situation in every fire we get money to the victims and we make sure [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1733.92s)]
*  that nothing stands in the way of that but I just want to thank you for your focus on bringing [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1738.88s)]
*  sanity to California water and fire policy there's no place that needs a revolution in common sense [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1744.24s)]
*  quite like California you have so much water you use it and be happy about it Mr. President [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1749.6000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President my name is Joel Pollack and I am a journalist with Bright Bart News but I happen to [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1757.2s)]
*  live in the Pacific oh my god as do Bright Bart [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1763.76s)]
*  one colleague John Kahn wrote the song writer which you played at your campaign rallies he lost his [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1770.48s)]
*  house and the studio why is a bright bar reporter at the emergency fire briefing sitting with like [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1776.0s)]
*  local officials bro there was no water in the pipes so I got inside and I picked up the flower [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1782.8799999999999s)]
*  vases because I give my wife flowers every week oh my god there and we started with that then I [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1790.32s)]
*  found my son's bucket of baseballs and I dumped the baseballs on the ground and I used the bucket [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1796.32s)]
*  but there was still no water except for the water in the gutter coming from the burnt homes uphill [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1802.56s)]
*  so I went to and fro does the reminder that even Ben Shapiro thought Bright Bart was far too anti- [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1808.72s)]
*  Semitic for him and that's why he left Bright Bart like he brand Bishopbury's a right for Bright [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1815.92s)]
*  Bart and he was like yeah you guys have gotten completely out of control with the anti-Semitism [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1822.24s)]
*  we were lucky our house was saved this guy seemingly does not have that issue okay I have to rely on [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1825.68s)]
*  buckets to put out a fire that's right per hour wind or 100 mile per hour wind but there were many [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1830.64s)]
*  things that went wrong here that are basic and small we did not have traffic police to guide the [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1836.8000000000002s)]
*  evacuation so there was gridlock on sunset they've removed the vehicles now but there were dozens of [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1843.76s)]
*  vehicles that were abandoned by drivers who fled for their lives because there were no traffic [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1849.12s)]
*  cops available the fire department wasn't pre-deployed even though there was an extreme [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1853.84s)]
*  wind event coming and many of my neighbors lost their fire insurance in the days before the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1859.44s)]
*  blaze so I asked my neighbors what would they want to know if I could ask the president a question [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1867.44s)]
*  and the number one thing was insurance can you work with the insurance companies to get people [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1873.68s)]
*  back to where they were before they lost the coverage because of California's regulations [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1880.3200000000002s)]
*  and can you make California change its rules so that when we build again we can get fire insurance [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1885.68s)]
*  and we don't have to worry and there's one other point I want to make I really appreciate my [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1892.48s)]
*  congressman advocating for money we need the money from the federal government but I also [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1896.72s)]
*  understand Americans who are tired of spending money on California and disasters happen and the [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1901.44s)]
*  California government passes 50 million dollars to oppose your policies so they have 50 million [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1908.4s)]
*  for that but not for moving people into rental homes or helping people relocate or rebuild [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1913.44s)]
*  I would like to ask you to follow the 9-11 commission precedent and appoint a special master [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1920.16s)]
*  to watch the money to make sure that every federal dollar that gets spent here is spent [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1927.04s)]
*  on fire relief and rebuilding and not on everything else good idea [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1932.32s)]

*  why do you think the other local officials were talking about redirecting redirecting water into [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1965.76s)]
*  agribusiness in southern California that's their own personal pet project which is fine but Rick [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=1973.04s)]

*  what is coming in so is fulsome lake and those are federal projects that should be building up [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2690.08s)]
*  because we're latter january latter january here and there's not you can't count on the rain and [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2695.7599999999998s)]

*  maybe the santa ynez reservoir that was empty during this you know you don't even need reservoirs [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2716.64s)]
*  with the water coming down you don't need the reservoir you have so much water you don't need [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2720.7999999999997s)]
*  it you only have reservoirs because you're trying to hold water but you have natural water coming [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2724.56s)]
*  down along the coast it's for a million years it's been coming you know that right yeah in addition [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2730.08s)]
*  to that you have a lot of half pipe in other words you have the half pipe that's built and it hasn't [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2736.72s)]
*  been used you see it's bone dry no water has been in that half pipe for years and years closed up [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2741.52s)]
*  years ago at the reservoir it's already there yeah you got a reservoir above santa salisade [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2749.36s)]
*  has been full they wouldn't have run out of water in a few hours it would have gone for at least a [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2756.16s)]
*  few days with 40 40 acre feet out of 600 000 that reservoir has been empty for a long time [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2760.08s)]
*  it shouldn't have been empty okay any other questions i don't get it why are the [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2766.96s)]
*  the actual professionals that are tasked with water management not like getting factored into [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2770.96s)]
*  the equation i've heard the exact opposite from all of them loyal support to our military maybe [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2776.96s)]
*  i'm wrong i don't know officers and especially our firefighters he's right that's why [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2782.08s)]
*  is this the water pressure chart yeah forward it's to get these men and women like they're [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2796.7999999999997s)]
*  there they're talking about reservoirs but like i don't understand they're talking about reservoirs [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2802.0s)]
*  here but like they didn't they did not have adequate water pressure but outside of inadequate [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2808.24s)]
*  water pressure like the reservoirs were above average in terms of how filled they were i just [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2816.48s)]
*  ask for your ongoing partnership with fema and the epa and our other federal agencies to make sure [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2822.0s)]
*  that we have a commitment to cross all layers of government to get these people back home thank [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2829.04s)]
*  you sir i do i do thank you very much it's well said i do have to say fema is a big disappointment [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2835.04s)]
*  we had it working well we had great people but fema is not good anymore what fema did in north [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2842.32s)]
*  carolina you know they still haven't even gone to certain areas they don't know what they're doing [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2846.8s)]
*  and i say you don't need fema you need a good state government and when you have a problem in [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2850.64s)]
*  los angeles or when you have a problem even in the state of california you have your own [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2857.6s)]
*  essentially fema you fix it yourself you don't have somebody coming in from a state where they [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2862.16s)]
*  have no idea like florida they come in from hurricanes they have people staying in alaska [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=2867.2799999999997s)]

*  that's why you can't talk about climate change people who want the apocalypse to happen no i [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=3776.7200000000003s)]

*  instances of regulatory capture or certain restrictions that might actually get in the way [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=3875.68s)]
*  of of maybe even hardening the infrastructure right maybe making the the the [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=3881.9199999999996s)]
*  uh maybe making the the the the forests less susceptible to wildfires like controlled burns [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=3888.56s)]

*  homes anymore is because there wasn't adequate safety measures implemented so the notion that [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=3926.24s)]
*  like we should cast aside all of the existing environmental regulations and restrictions that [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImbVrQEh2p0&t=3933.12s)]
