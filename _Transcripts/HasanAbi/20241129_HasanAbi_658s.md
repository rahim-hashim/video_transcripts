# Biden Calls Trump's Tariffs 'Counterproductive | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM)
*  This is Austria. What's going on? What's going on? What are they doing? What are what's happening here? What has happened to my white culture? Americans are such that the only white culture and even their understanding of white culture is basically just an ad from the 50s. Okay, that's it. We have one speed and that speed is hamburger. Okay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=0.0s)]
*  You're going to cover the shit show in European elections, Georgia and Romania, brother European elections. And then you said Georgia, what's going on? I mean, Georgia and Romania are experiencing the exact same problems right now in their elections. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=30.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't say Georgia is Europe at this point. Like, come on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=44.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=48.0s)]
*  This morning, President elect Trump and the president of Mexico at odds over a phone call about immigration. Trump says Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum agreed to stop migration through Mexico and into the United States, effectively closing our southern border. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=78.0s)]
*  Scheinbaum says she told Trump migrant caravans are being stopped before reaching the US, saying, we reiterate that Mexico's position is not to close borders. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=92.0s)]
*  We're going to fix our borders. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=101.0s)]
*  Immigration, a key issue for Trump on the campaign trail. He is threatening to impose a 25% tariff on goods coming from Mexico and Canada on his first day back in office. Trump blaming both countries for the way. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=103.0s)]
*  What do you mean Georgia is not in Europe? I don't know, man. Open up a map. What are you talking about? Like, what are you? What are you talking about? Like saying Georgia's in Europe is like saying Armenia is a European country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=116.0s)]
*  The only reason why you think that is because they're Christian, I guess. Say you mean the EU. No, I mean the European continent, dude. What are we talking about? Hello. Do you guys know where Georgia is on the map? What the y'all just see, bro? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=126.0s)]
*  I swear to God y'all just see like Christian nation. You see crosses on their flag and you go, oh, they're, you know, that's a European country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=143.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=152.0s)]
*  don't know anymore. I don't know. We've had a deal in the electronic vacuum. That kid [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=182.0s)]
*  is crazy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=195.8s)]
*  go solve what he calls a long simmering problem. So I guess Bosnia and Albania aren't European [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=197.0s)]
*  because they Muslim. First of all, I mean, kind of, yeah. Go ask people in Europe if [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=203.84s)]
*  they think that Bosnia and Albania are European or not. But also secondly, at least it's on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=209.24s)]
*  the continent, dude. Like, what do you mean? Yes, it is on the European continent. Having [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=214.96s)]
*  said that, however, because of their, yes, because of their, their, because of the fact [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=221.74s)]
*  that they're Muslim, many European, many European nations do actually do wish that they weren't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=226.86s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=235.02s)]
*  It's after suggesting Mexico would retaliate. There is no European continent. Wait, what? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=236.02s)]
*  Now we're just now we're okay. Now we're getting into some new theories here. Okay. It against [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=240.86s)]
*  us tariffs with tariffs of their own. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=246.18s)]
*  It was potential. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=248.3s)]
*  I hope he thinks that President Biden calls Trump's tariff threats on the U.S. as North [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=249.3s)]
*  American neighbors, counterproductive. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=262.26s)]
*  We have a usual city. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=263.86s)]
*  Technically Europe is a subcontinent of Eurasia. Okay. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=266.94s)]
*  We're surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean and two allies, Mexico and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=269.14s)]
*  the last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=277.02s)]
*  Shine bomb says there will be more conversations before Trump takes office. As for Canada, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=280.41999999999996s)]

*  impose on the U S no final decision has been made. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=288.18s)]
*  Now to President Biden weighing in on president elect Trump's threat to impose stiff tariffs [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=292.09999999999997s)]

*  Anyway, he still wants Georgia to join a justice Cyprus did while Albania, Turkey and Bosnia [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=303.38s)]
*  aren't used basically the Holy Roman Empire at this point. Yeah, it's just they okay. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=309.38s)]

*  vegetables. Giveaway alert. Wait, okay, who won it? Who won the giveaway? Did we choose a winner? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=432.38s)]

*  that Mexico's position is not to close borders. And Jay, as we stand by to see how that plays out, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirVJ8hrzQM&t=491.90000000000003s)]
