**HasanAbi:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik)
*  Ukraine could have pushed for peace at any point. Zelensky made a terrible mistake at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=0.0s)]
*  the beginning when he made it clear that he would never negotiate with Putin. If you think [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2.64s)]
*  that this was entirely in the hands of Zelensky and that Zelensky wasn't actually just actively [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5.68s)]
*  assuming and regurgitating the American state department position, I also have a separate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=10.6s)]
*  bridge to sell you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=16.06s)]
*  Zelensky is not like an independent actor to the, I know. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=17.7s)]

*  out to Jeffrey Sachs or Mercheimer, I would love to have them on the broadcast. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=71.74s)]
*  Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now's Juan González in Chicago. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=76.78s)]
*  Also my goat. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=80.74s)]
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=82.74s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=87.46s)]
*  We begin today's show with the high-level talks between Russian and U.S. officials in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=88.94s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, where they're meeting to discuss a possible end to the war in Ukraine and ways [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=92.94s)]
*  between Washington and Moscow. The talks include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=98.14s)]
*  Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and might pave the way for a possible meeting between [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=103.7s)]
*  President Trump and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Today's talks come less [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=108.26s)]
*  than a week after Trump held a 90-minute call with Putin. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=113.0s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday on a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=117.78s)]
*  separate state visit, was not invited to attend the U.S.-Russian talks. Zelensky spoke to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=123.12s)]
*  reporters Monday. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=127.36s)]
*  Ukraine will not take part in the talks. Ukraine did not know anything about them. Ukraine [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=128.36s)]
*  regards any negotiations on Ukraine, without Ukraine, as ones that have no result. And [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=137.56s)]
*  we cannot recognize any agreements about us made without us, and will not recognize such [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  agreements. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=150.52s)]
*  Zelensky also rejected a demand by the Trump administration for Ukraine to give the United [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=151.56s)]
*  States ownership of half of Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for past and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=157.44s)]
*  future aid to Ukraine. He called for stronger American security guarantees as part of any [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=163.72s)]
*  minerals deal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=168.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, at an emergency European summit on Ukraine held in Paris Monday, European [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=169.84s)]
*  leaders were divided on proposals for European troops to be deployed inside Ukraine in the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=175.02s)]
*  event of a peace deal. While German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was highly inappropriate [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  to be discussing sending troops before a peace deal is reached, British Prime Minister Keir [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=184.96s)]
*  Stormer offered to send British troops to Ukraine. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=189.32s)]
*  At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=192.4s)]
*  a whole, and therefore vital for Britain's national interest. Europe must play its role. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=200.76s)]
*  And I'm prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground alongside others [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=207.84s)]
*  if there is a lasting peace agreement. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  Commenting on the meeting, Denmark's Prime Minister, Mathieu Frederiksen, said she was [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  concerned about what she called Russia's imperial dreams. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=224.72s)]
*  I am very concerned about making a fast ceasefire because it can actually give a lot of support [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=229.72s)]
*  to Russia. I think it's a better possibility to go back to Russia and to re-ramp and to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  mobilize again, attack Ukraine or another country in Europe. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=243.56s)]
*  For more on all of this, we're joined by two guests. From Washington, D.C., Matt Duss [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=249.16s)]
*  is with us, Executive Vice President at the Center for International Policy, former Foreign [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  Policy Advisor for Senator Bernie Sanders. His latest piece for The Guardian, Demi- [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=258.92s)]
*  Remember when I told you guys that I was cautiously optimistic about the ceasefire that Donald [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=264.92s)]
*  Trump pushed for? And I told you that there is still a capacity for Israel to violate [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  the terms and conditions of said ceasefire. But more importantly, Israel will also most [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  likely use this as an opportunity to revamp and then go in and most likely permanently [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=282.76s)]
*  annex the West Bank. Okay. And they have already violated the ceasefire, but it still is, you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=287.7s)]
*  know, holding on. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=295.97999999999996s)]
*  Now on that front, my predictions are pretty accurate. Having said that, I still maintain [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=297.5s)]
*  the position that the ceasefire was good because it's always good to do a ceasefire. Okay. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=305.5s)]
*  The reason why I'm prefacing this with my Israel-Palestine statements is because I have [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=313.5s)]
*  the exact same position on Ukraine and Russia. Okay. And yet when I say the same things for [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=320.5s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia, a lot of people who are well-intentioned people, okay, a lot of people [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=326.94s)]
*  who are well-intentioned people who are pro-Palestinian and pro-Ukrainian misunderstand this as a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=335.18s)]
*  oh, you love Adolf Pootler. Okay. Just understand where I'm coming from. This is not contradictory. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=342.7s)]
*  My statement here is not contradictory. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=352.46s)]
*  Democrats have become the party of war. Americans are tired of it. Matt Duss's recent foreign [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=354.86s)]
*  policy piece is it's time for Ukraine to make the best peace it can. And in Brussels, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=360.14s)]
*  we're joined by Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=366.74s)]
*  Columbia University, president of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. He served as [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=370.86s)]
*  advisor to three UN secretaries general, is now a sustainable development solutions advocate [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=376.54s)]
*  under Secretary General Antonio Guterres. His piece for common dreams is headlined the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=381.54s)]
*  war in Ukraine was provoked and why that matters to achieve peace. Let's begin with Professor [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=386.42s)]
*  Sachs in Brussels. You're going to be involved with an event in Brussels tomorrow, the geopolitics [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=392.82s)]
*  of. I'm sorry, dude, but it's a bad position. It gives us the upper hand, which is bad. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=400.02s)]
*  I'm sorry, dude. Ceasefire for Palestine is bad. It's a bad position. It gives Israel [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=404.5s)]
*  the upper hand, which is why it's bad. Like what upper hand, what more upper hand does [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=409.74s)]
*  Russia need to have in this situation? Notice how the, notice how the territories that Russia [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=414.8s)]
*  has forcibly conquered and annexed have grown since the last time ceasefire was even on [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=423.1s)]
*  the table. Should we wait for more territory? You know, you said Crimea was a part of Russia. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=429.54s)]
*  Yes, Crimea is different than Eastern Ukraine. And I've explained it a million times over, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=434.98s)]
*  but for some weird reason, nobody gives a fuck about all of the reasons as to why it [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=440.78000000000003s)]
*  was an entirely different set of circumstances for Russia in terms of overtaking Crimea as [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=446.58000000000004s)]
*  opposed to overtaking Eastern Ukraine because you're a dumbass, a son. Yes, I'm a dumbass. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=452.12s)]
*  I know we can just have a disagreement on this issue and you can say I'm a fucking [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=457.88s)]
*  dumbass all day, every day. Your attitudes, Russian expansion is suspicious. I'm not going [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=462.84s)]
*  to lie. If my attitudes Russian expansion was suspicious, then I would be in favor of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=466.52s)]
*  Russia expanding into Eastern Ukraine. I would be in favor of, of all of the actions that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=472.32s)]
*  have taken place in the past three years. I am not notice how what I was in favor of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=479.02s)]
*  Ukraine had significantly more leverage was still the same process. And if they had actually [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=485.08000000000004s)]
*  conducted that 15 point plan, okay, if they had conducted that 15 point plan way back [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=491.12s)]
*  when they had the opportunity to plenty of additional territory would not have been seized. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  You've said Russia is the aggressor, but your attitudes, Ukrainian sovereignty is just [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=505.76s)]
*  odd. Let's just keep going. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=508.8s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happening right now in Saudi Arabia? You have the representatives [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=511.8s)]
*  of President Trump and President Putin who have just been involved with four hours of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  negotiations. You have Zelensky meeting with the Turkish president and now headed to Saudi [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=522.28s)]
*  Arabia for different meetings. And he said nothing about us without us. But can you talk [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=528.44s)]
*  about what's happening now in Saudi Arabia and the possibility of peace? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=533.48s)]
*  Good morning, Amy. Good morning, Matt. What's happening in Saudi Arabia is potentially very [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=539.08s)]
*  good news. It could mean the end of a war in which perhaps a million Ukrainians have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=545.96s)]
*  died or been wounded gravely up until now. This is a war that never should have happened. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=555.2s)]
*  It came about because of several provocative US actions over 30 years, notably the expansion [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=564.36s)]
*  of NATO against commitments made back in 1990. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  Ukraine could have pushed for peace at any point. Zelensky made a terrible mistake at [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=577.52s)]
*  the beginning when he made it clear that he would never negotiate with Putin. If you think [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=579.88s)]
*  that this was entirely in the hands of Zelensky and that Zelensky wasn't actually just actively [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=582.88s)]
*  assuming and regurgitating the American State Department position, I also have a separate [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=587.8s)]
*  bridge to sell you. Zelensky is not like an independent actor. I know that everyone is [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=593.28s)]
*  going to get very mad at me for saying this, but he is, for obvious reasons, born out of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=601.0s)]
*  the Russian invasion, a desperate man desperately trying to save what remains of his country. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=607.8399999999999s)]
*  And in that desperate moment, he will do anything that the United States tells him to say and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=614.92s)]
*  do. It wasn't up to Zelensky to not negotiate with Putin or to say he's never going to negotiate [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=620.24s)]
*  with Putin. It does not matter what he says in this process. If America, I mean, you'll [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=626.68s)]
*  see it's unfolding in front of our eyes right now, which is why it's so funny when people [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=632.36s)]
*  are like, no, you don't understand. Zelensky was operating autonomously and it's his fault. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=636.16s)]
*  When guess what, dude? You think Zelensky wants to sell $500 billion of natural resources [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=642.2s)]
*  to the United States government? No, he doesn't want to. This is an American colony. I don't [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=648.16s)]
*  think he's in favor of that. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what he's in favor of. Ukraine [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  is desperate, but Ukraine doesn't hold the cards here. America does. This was naive because [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  Zelensky was never in a position to demand regime change in Russia. In order to preserve [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=663.7199999999999s)]
*  Ukrainian lives, you have to negotiate with Putin. So once you learn this lesson in the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  most terrible way imaginable, so we can blame him for much of this. No, this, none of this [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=670.16s)]
*  was up to Zelensky. It's crazy. Zelensky is simply just the person. Zelensky is simply [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=673.88s)]
*  just the person who is tasked with being the Ukrainian voice. Okay. Putting a Ukrainian [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=681.04s)]
*  voice to what America's interests are. People who chirp about your Ukraine takes aren't [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=686.8s)]
*  actually criticizing taste. They're just upset with the vibes. I know. And the vibes have [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=691.38s)]
*  been primed by people making false assertions about my position on Ukraine for three fucking [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=694.42s)]
*  years and just operating off of that false premise over and over again, as they make [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=701.6s)]
*  newer content, which is why so many people unironically are both a in denial about what [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  is currently ongoing and what's currently happening with the Trump administration. They're [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  just like, I don't get it. Ukraine was always winning the war. The West was always helping [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=715.62s)]
*  Ukraine win the war. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=719.82s)]
*  Why won't the West just help Ukraine win the war even more than, than they have? It seems [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=720.82s)]
*  really spoiling the deal. Like, yeah, if you believe that Ukraine was always dominating [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=725.44s)]
*  Russians and that Russian still somehow magically overtook more and more Ukrainian territory [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=731.96s)]
*  and forcibly annexed it, then yeah, you're going to be shocked at what is going on. The [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  only reason why you need to give the full argument about self-determination and make [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=744.72s)]
*  the Crimea comparison with Taiwan in regards to who gets self-determination for people [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=748.52s)]
*  your stance. Normies won't understand without the background lore and will keep misunderstanding [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=752.08s)]
*  your position. In my opinion, that's interesting that you say that because I have actually [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=755.9200000000001s)]
*  personally talked about that a million times over. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=759.44s)]
*  They simply say that it doesn't matter what the Western polling indicated in Crimea in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=761.5600000000001s)]
*  terms of like seeing themselves as Russian or wanting to be a part of Russia before the [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=766.36s)]
*  Russian annexation and that the subsequent sham trials that took place under Russian [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=770.52s)]
*  occupation were also built around falsehoods. They will also then say, it doesn't matter [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=776.72s)]
*  that Ukraine's reaction to Crimea's annexation was to destroy the waterways that were built [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=782.0s)]
*  under the USSR that actually got that brought water from Ukraine into Crimea in an, in a [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=788.2s)]
*  final act of desperation, which is not something that you would do if you actually cared about [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=795.84s)]
*  the safety of the citizens that was now under Russian occupation, except they don't care [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=800.72s)]
*  about any of those things. They probably don't know many of those things that happened. And [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=806.92s)]
*  even if they did, they still wouldn't care because it's much better to just simply assume [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=810.84s)]
*  a narrative. That's why I try to hit this from the angle that is the most easy to understand, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=815.64s)]
*  which is why is it that it has taken three years and tens of thousands of lives for Russia [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=821.36s)]
*  to take inches of fucking Ukrainian territory as opposed to how easily Russia overtook Crimea [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=828.36s)]
*  virtually without a single shot being fired. That's why I asked this question with the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=835.36s)]
*  hopes that people will think about that a little bit. Okay. That's why I also explained [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=842.36s)]
*  to people how major of a mistake it was aside from the violence. If we were to talk about [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=847.36s)]
*  this from the perspective of states and how states operate, because they don't care about [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=855.36s)]
*  the morality of fucking violence and bloodshed, okay. How bad of a mistake it was for Vladimir [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=860.36s)]
*  Putin to invade Ukraine specifically because all of the territories that might've had any [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=867.36s)]
*  kind of sympathy, like all the cities like Kharkiv that might've had any kind of sympathy [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=872.36s)]
*  for Russians or felt any sort of like ethnic allegiance to the Russians now despise the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=877.36s)]
*  Russians because guess what? They came in and they fucking blew up all of the apartment [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=884.36s)]
*  complexes. Why the fuck would you be in favor of that nation any longer after that happens? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=889.36s)]
*  Anyway, and when you say Crimea is primarily Russian because of colonialization though, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=894.36s)]
*  you're absolutely correct. It's not colonialization necessarily, but it's Russification of Crimea [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=899.36s)]
*  where they forcibly excised the Tatar, the indigenous Tatar population from Crimea. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=904.36s)]
*  That happened a very long time ago, however, that is unjustifiable for sure, but make no [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=909.36s)]
*  mistake that happened far before Ukraine and Russia became, you know, post Soviet nation [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=916.36s)]
*  states. That's why I also always say, that's why I also say give Crimea back to the Turks. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=924.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? As a joke, this is what Hassan Ali deals with every damn day. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=931.36s)]
*  What a legend. Yeah. Tatar's are also Genghis, Genghis, it colonizes not indigenous. Okay. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=936.36s)]
*  Fair. But like, come on. It's like saying Turks are also not indigenous to Anatolia. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=941.36s)]
*  You're right. But holy fuck, how far back are we going? You know what I mean? Also the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=946.36s)]
*  chatter that made fun of me for saying Genghis that's actually how you're supposed to say [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=951.36s)]
*  it, but we're not even going to fucking get into it. Giving Crimea back to the Turks would [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=955.36s)]
*  be like Israel state taking Judea and Samaria. Yeah, I'm fucking joking. Okay. When I say [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=958.36s)]
*  that I am joking, but the joke is in the direction of like who Crimea belongs to. Let's continue [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=964.36s)]
*  the U S participation in a violent coup in Ukraine in February, 2014, the U S Ukraine [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=972.36s)]
*  agreement to discard a UN security council back to Minsk to the U S. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=980.36s)]
*  You have done in China. Crimea situation is mostly because of his importance for military [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=988.36s)]
*  purposes. Your lawyer talking sounds weirdly Russian. No, the lore I'm talking about is just [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=991.36s)]
*  simply the truth, but you're right. It is for military purposes. You're absolutely fucking [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=996.36s)]
*  correct, which is precisely the reason why even under Ukrainian rule, Crimea still had a very [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1000.36s)]
*  important military, a very important Naval base for Russia, Sevastopol. So yeah, that is [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1005.36s)]
*  correct. Crimea is the entry point of the black sea for the Russian Navy. Also, this isn't lore. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1012.36s)]
*  It's just history. What the fuck? You're, you're making it seem like I'm just telling a story [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1019.36s)]
*  like lore. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  Agreement and the failure of the Biden administration to negotiate with president Putin in [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1026.3600000000001s)]
*  December, 2021 and January, 2022. I was personally involved in watching closely all of those events [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1034.36s)]
*  over the past 30 years. This war never should have happened. It could have been averted at many [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1047.36s)]
*  times. It could have ended in negotiation in March, 2022, saving the lives of hundreds of [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1053.36s)]
*  thousands of Ukrainians. I urged it. The Ukrainians walked away from the table because I urged it too. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1062.36s)]
*  And everybody said I was a fucking pro-Russian stooge. British and the Americans told them to. This is [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1070.36s)]
*  so tragic. And everyone will understand this as the historians make all of this very clear. I, again, I flew [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1077.36s)]
*  to Ankara in the Ukraine walked away. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1086.36s)]
*  I mean, look, the details on this is murky and didn't Biden literally met with Putin and told him not to invade [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1090.36s)]
*  and Putin ignored. I don't remember. He might've, but that kind of beefs up Trump's narrative on the, on the matter. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1098.36s)]
*  Doesn't it pretty sure they would live better under Turkey than with Russia. Fucking fuck. No. Okay. This is [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1104.36s)]
*  the say that the Russian government Russian rulership over Crimea is good. I'm just simply saying that [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1110.36s)]
*  Turkish, the Turkish government is not great. Okay. Holy fuck. All bit of the world can I'm gonna cream. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1117.36s)]
*  You're sick. Meal you could I could I know a little your history sounds like Putin's one in parts where Ukraine seemingly [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1123.36s)]
*  have not existed prior to dissolution of the USSR or its creation. No, what are you talking about? I am not saying [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1129.36s)]
*  that Ukraine is a nation state has no established national boundaries or is a part of Russia or some shit. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1135.36s)]
*  I'm not saying that at all. The fuck the spring of 2022 to understanding give Ukraine the Crimea problem [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1140.36s)]
*  solved. Give Crimea or give give Ukraine and Crimea to China. Sorry. Give Ukraine and Crimea to China problem [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1146.36s)]
*  solved. Okay. They will have fantastic infrastructure in a matter of in a matter of months. A lot of [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1155.36s)]
*  confusion. Please clarify your stance on what who are Ted Tards. What is Tud Tards chat? A lot of confusion. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1164.36s)]
*  Please clarify your stance bro. Just Google it please. I mean come on like you're like hey can you please give me more [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1172.36s)]
*  information so I can like cynically dunk on your position further is crazy. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Just Google it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1180.36s)]
*  Google it on your own. Exactly how these negotiations had broken down and the United States and Britain were behind it [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1187.36s)]
*  because as Keith Stammer said in the clip that you played this is about Europe security. They're using Ukraine. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1194.36s)]
*  This is the bottom line. So what's happening in short in Saudi Arabia is the most positive news for Ukrainians [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1202.36s)]
*  that there has been in years. President Trump understands and unfortunately previous presidents did not. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1210.36s)]
*  That the US provocations need to stop. So this war stops. So I don't even believe that. I just did. That's crazy. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1223.36s)]
*  I don't. That's giving Trump way too much credit. I think I think he is is I don't know. I love how lipstick Russia will innate [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1235.36s)]
*  even further west for some reason. Dude I'm not making any predictions. Okay. I'm not going to say there is no way [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1244.36s)]
*  Vladimir Putin invades further west. Okay. I'm not saying nothing. You understand me. You take that take and you shove it in your pocket. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1250.36s)]
*  Okay. That's not going to come from my mouth. I will never say that. I've learned my lesson. Okay. Sax is too multipolar pill. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1259.36s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think I don't think Donald Trump is making you know brilliant states brilliant decisions in terms of foreign policy. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1267.36s)]
*  So the deaths stop. That is the bottom line. I think it's important for everybody to understand also that on October 5th 2022 Zelensky ruled out any negotiations. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1278.36s)]
*  He said it's illegal. This was a declaration of the Ukrainian government. So Ukraine sadly the or not the or fish the appearance of orf is along the length of folklore where they're considered [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1292.36s)]

*  dragons God's palace signaling impending doom. Despite these legends no scientific evidence supports the myth that or fish predict disasters. However their rare appearances on shore have historically coincided with significant seismic events. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1321.36s)]
*  For instance numerous or fishes were seen before the devastating 2011 toku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Similarly one was last sighted in California just for a seven magnitude earthquake last year. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1333.36s)]
*  Nonetheless these correlations are merely anecdotal or fishing habit deep waters worldwide and their appearances on land might simply be due to sickness or the end of their lifecycle rather than prophetic messages of natural disasters. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1344.36s)]

*  They said we don't want any table all along. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1481.48s)]
*  And Zelensky rules by martial law, by decree, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1485.3999999999999s)]
*  when the- [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1489.84s)]
*  Bro, you were wrong like two years, three years ago, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1490.6799999999998s)]
*  not even two, and people don't let it go. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1492.8s)]
*  Imagine if you were wrong more often. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1494.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if I was wrong more often, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1496.72s)]
*  maybe they would just focus on what I'm wrong on [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1498.36s)]
*  instead of making random shit up about me. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1500.4399999999998s)]
*  So maybe I should just say wrong takes every now and then. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1502.9199999999998s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1505.84s)]
*  All of the other shit that they make up about me, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1506.6799999999998s)]
*  they make up because they can always go back and point to, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1508.48s)]
*  Hassan predicted that Russia would never invade Ukraine. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1511.36s)]
*  Opinion surveys show that a majority of Ukrainians [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1514.6799999999998s)]
*  want peace right now, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1518.28s)]
*  even at the cost of territorial concessions. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  So my bottom line, Amy, is that while [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1524.28s)]
*  the Trump administration does some pretty weird things [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1527.84s)]
*  like demanding mineral rights, this is absurd. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1530.9199999999998s)]
*  This is completely bizarre. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1535.32s)]
*  At the same time, the Trump administration, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1538.32s)]
*  for the first time, is telling the truth [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1542.04s)]
*  about the fundamental causes of this war [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  and how it can end. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1547.36s)]
*  And that is the best news possible for Ukraine, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  first and foremost, and for the United States, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  for Russia, and for the world, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1555.52s)]
*  that peace could come to Ukraine very, very shortly. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1557.28s)]
*  So this, I think, is the bottom line. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1561.48s)]
*  Why does anyone care about Ukraine prediction? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1564.68s)]
*  You're just a streamer. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1566.44s)]
*  Who cares if you got it wrong? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1567.28s)]
*  A lot of people, whether that's good or bad, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1568.1200000000001s)]
*  and I think there's some good and some bad there, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1570.04s)]
*  rely on me for understanding the world. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1573.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1576.6s)]
*  So they felt betrayed. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1577.48s)]
*  I'd like to bring in Matt Dussen to the conversation. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1578.84s)]
*  Matt, your reaction to the events [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1581.4s)]
*  and the Trump administration's complete reversal [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1585.96s)]
*  of the previous administration's policy [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1589.64s)]
*  and this whole issue of whether there could have been [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1592.64s)]
*  peace earlier on, but that the Biden administration [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1595.24s)]
*  and the British scuttled the developing peace plan [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1598.48s)]
*  back two years ago. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1604.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, first off, and again, great to be with you [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1606.8400000000001s)]
*  and great to be here with Professor Sacks. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1608.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think the story that Professor Sacks just told, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1611.44s)]
*  there are elements of truth to it, but there are also, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1616.12s)]
*  it's a great deal in there that's misleading [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1618.24s)]
*  and frankly, completely one-sided, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1620.08s)]
*  absolving Vladimir Putin of any responsibility. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1622.28s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is the one who chose to invade Ukraine. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1624.76s)]
*  Let's remember. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1628.16s)]
*  If you're wondering why Bernie Sanders's [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1629.0s)]
*  foreign policy takes are eh, not, you know, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1630.56s)]
*  not exactly aligned with mine, for example. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1635.04s)]
*  This is Bernie Sanders's foreign policy advisor. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1638.92s)]
*  Remember, it's important to understand the history. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1641.72s)]
*  And I'm not even talking about like Ukraine in general. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1644.6s)]
*  I'm, you know. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1647.36s)]
*  Understand that the role that NATO expansion has played [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1649.56s)]
*  as being seen as a threat to Russia, that is real. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1652.8s)]
*  That however, does not explain. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1656.24s)]
*  He doesn't work for Bernie Sanders anymore. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1658.72s)]
*  He's at the center of international politics, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1660.32s)]
*  but understand that he is still far, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1663.32s)]
*  far more progressive than like 99% of think tank heads, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1669.32s)]
*  in the NatSac side of things. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1675.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1677.08s)]
*  Just understand Matt does is like infinitely more progressive [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1678.04s)]
*  and infinitely better than virtually every other person. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1681.28s)]
*  He's just, you know, he's just, I don't know. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1685.6799999999998s)]
*  He's a little bit more, you know, I mean, Matt, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1689.36s)]
*  those are pretty good. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1693.2s)]
*  Just more liberal, but anti-intervention is, yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1694.04s)]
*  He's just a little libed up. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1695.6799999999998s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's decision to illegally invade Annex [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1697.48s)]
*  and occupy parts of Ukraine. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1701.8s)]
*  Vladimir Putin himself has told us multiple times [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1703.52s)]
*  what his vision for Ukraine is, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1707.16s)]
*  and that's to retake Ukraine and make it once again, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1709.08s)]
*  part of the larger Russian Imperium. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1712.04s)]
*  So again, important to understand the historical context, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1715.52s)]
*  but I would really warn against seeing, you know, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1718.04s)]
*  Vladimir Putin as some kind of innocent victim [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1721.2s)]
*  of American machinations here, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1723.8s)]
*  which is the story that Professor Sacks [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1725.76s)]
*  seems to be trying to tell. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1727.32s)]
*  And lastly, it really denies the Ukrainians any agency, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1729.48s)]
*  any responsibility for their own independence, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1733.8400000000001s)]
*  for their own democracy. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1735.92s)]
*  The Ukrainians are not simply being treated [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1737.8s)]
*  as instruments of American power here. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1740.24s)]
*  The Ukrainians have made decisions on their own. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1742.3600000000001s)]
*  Some of them have been wise, some of them very admirable, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1744.72s)]
*  some of them less so. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1748.48s)]
*  I think we can discuss that as well, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1749.52s)]
*  but they have played a major role here, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1752.2s)]
*  and I think that is what's concerning [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1753.68s)]
*  about these talks going on in Saudi Arabia, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1755.64s)]
*  is that they are not there, not there, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1759.0s)]
*  and they are not included, and they have said, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1760.56s)]
*  President Zelensky has said, that they will not be bound [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1762.2s)]
*  by any decisions made without their participation, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1765.92s)]
*  which I think we can all agree [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1768.72s)]
*  is quite a legitimate position. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1769.96s)]
*  Now, having said that, you know, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1772.3600000000001s)]
*  this is not the first time [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1774.44s)]
*  you've had a US administration engaging. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1775.56s)]
*  I think your take on Ukraine's situation is, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1778.52s)]
*  and Craig, Ukraine right now at least has the attention [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1779.92s)]
*  of the Western world to ceasefire, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1781.72s)]
*  would diminish the amount of aid it's getting, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1782.76s)]
*  kind of to whatever Western journalists [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1784.16s)]
*  slash Russian propagandists were saying [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1786.24s)]
*  is Kiev will fall in three days, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1787.68s)]
*  speaking as a Russian here. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1789.16s)]
*  What? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1791.3200000000002s)]
*  It was getting no attention [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1792.16s)]
*  when Russia was fucking pummeling Eastern Ukraine. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1793.4s)]
*  It literally became a, it became an unpopular, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1796.8s)]
*  an unpopular, but necessary realm of support a year in, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1802.64s)]
*  and then after October 7, it was done, okay? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1808.68s)]
*  After October 7, it was completely done. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1812.3600000000001s)]
*  If you think that like support for Ukraine, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1815.84s)]
*  I can't speak for Europe, okay? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1817.9199999999998s)]
*  But as far as like in the United States of America, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1820.12s)]
*  people don't necessarily give a shit about Ukraine at all. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1822.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1826.6s)]
*  They don't care about anything. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1827.6399999999999s)]
*  Americans are incredibly selfish. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1828.8s)]
*  That's why Joe Biden was trying to be like, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1830.8799999999999s)]
*  but see, we're making artillery factories [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1832.28s)]
*  in Scranton, Pennsylvania. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1834.56s)]
*  It's good. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1836.32s)]
*  And Americans were like, shut the fuck up, okay? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1837.1599999999999s)]
*  Fix the potholes. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1838.8799999999999s)]
*  Shut the fuck up, old man. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1840.3999999999999s)]
*  Fix the goddamn potholes. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1842.12s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1843.28s)]
*  Give me healthcare. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1844.1s)]
*  Americans care about money and bloodshed? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1845.0s)]
*  No, Americans, American foreign policy is both uniparty [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1847.2s)]
*  and also far away, okay? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1850.76s)]
*  You have to understand this. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1853.04s)]
*  American foreign policy is so far away, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1855.08s)]
*  much more far away than European foreign policy is. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1857.76s)]
*  And that is precisely why the attitude is always gonna be [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1861.2s)]
*  different in Europe as well, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1863.52s)]
*  because there's much closer in proximity to the refugees, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1864.6s)]
*  much closer in proximity to the actual states [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1867.76s)]
*  that are warring with one another, okay? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1871.4s)]
*  American foreign policy, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1873.68s)]
*  due to America's position on the planet, literally, okay, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1875.24s)]
*  is super fucking far away. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1880.64s)]
*  So therefore, Americans can simultaneously fancy themselves [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1882.4s)]
*  to be peaceful doves who hate war [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1887.0600000000002s)]
*  and reap all of the benefits, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1889.3200000000002s)]
*  or at least the limited amount of trickle-down benefits [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1891.1200000000001s)]
*  that they get from destabilizing the global South. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1893.8s)]
*  This also presents an opportunity, however, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1898.0s)]
*  because there isn't much pro-war propaganda, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1900.76s)]
*  with the exception of 9-11, post-9-11 war on terror, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1904.84s)]
*  Americans themselves fancy themselves [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1908.64s)]
*  to be fucking pro-peace, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1911.68s)]
*  so a person who comes out and says, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1913.3s)]
*  I'm pro-peace, can actually use that [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1915.16s)]
*  to their benefit electorally. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1918.4s)]
*  And guess who did that? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1920.78s)]
*  Donald fucking Trump. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1922.08s)]
*  He lied, okay? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1923.6s)]
*  But at least he lied when the other side, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1925.9s)]
*  the Democratic Party was like, no, we love war. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1928.32s)]
*  We're gonna keep doing more war. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1930.96s)]
*  And look how well that turned out. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1932.82s)]
*  Donald Trump is president again. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1934.48s)]
*  Israel is far too, whereas pro-peace in Palestine, yes. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1936.56s)]
*  While Israel is, by proximity, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1940.1399999999999s)]
*  Israel's even further away from Ukraine. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1942.4199999999998s)]
*  Israel's actually much closer to America [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1944.84s)]
*  because it's an American state, okay? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1947.04s)]
*  Functionally, it is a literal American state. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1949.04s)]
*  That pisses off a lot of Americans too. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1953.9199999999998s)]
*  Once again, that pisses off Americans. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1957.32s)]
*  They're like, what the fuck are we doing? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  Why do you think there is a significant, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1961.9199999999998s)]
*  a significant popular mobilization, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1967.6399999999999s)]
*  a significant popular attitude surrounding [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1970.28s)]
*  pushing for a ceasefire in fucking Gaza? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1973.56s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1976.34s)]
*  With the government of Vladimir Putin, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1978.32s)]
*  of course, President Biden met with Putin in June 2020. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1979.84s)]
*  Holy Toledo, American support for Ukraine has plummeted [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1984.12s)]
*  since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1986.44s)]
*  The percentage who say US is doing too much [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1988.16s)]
*  is up sixfold from 7%. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1989.88s)]
*  The fun of the GOP is north of 60%. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1992.44s)]
*  US confidence in Zelensky dropped from 72% to under 50%. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=1994.88s)]
*  I've talked about this so many times. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2000.76s)]
*  Holy Toledo, look at this trend line here. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2005.04s)]
*  US support for Ukraine is too much. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2007.96s)]
*  Back when the war began, back in February of 2022, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2010.3600000000001s)]
*  it was just 7%, up like a rocket ship. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2013.3200000000002s)]
*  My goodness, up now in February of 2025 to 41%. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2017.0800000000002s)]
*  And the clear majority of Republicans, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2021.44s)]
*  and of course Republicans are in charge [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2023.44s)]
*  of the US government now, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2024.96s)]
*  62% of Republicans say that the US support [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2026.0800000000002s)]
*  for Ukraine is too much. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2029.4s)]
*  What a difference from just three years ago. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2030.72s)]
*  I can remember, John, all those backyards [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2032.6000000000001s)]
*  in the United States with those Ukrainian flags, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2034.88s)]
*  far fewer of them today, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2037.2s)]
*  as Americans' opinions on Ukraine have changed dramatically. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2038.52s)]
*  What about opinions of the Ukrainian president? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2041.72s)]
*  Imagine anyone trusting US assurances [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2043.88s)]
*  that they have their promised Ukraine and NATO membership [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2045.8400000000001s)]
*  and it ended up with them potentially losing territory [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2047.3600000000001s)]
*  nowhere near NATO. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2049.2000000000003s)]
*  Like what's the sauce to get the US to support you [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2050.44s)]
*  like they support Israel? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2053.84s)]
*  Have significant more, nevermind, forgot about AIPAC. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2055.64s)]
*  I mean, AIPAC is one aspect of this. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2059.16s)]
*  America does not trust Israel all that much, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2061.12s)]
*  but it trusts it a whole lot more than it does Egypt, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2064.92s)]
*  Jordan, Saudi Arabia, okay? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2068.92s)]
*  And every other country in the region. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2073.08s)]
*  Also, the United States never really gave actual assurances [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2075.16s)]
*  to Ukraine in terms of joining NATO. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2080.16s)]
*  That was always bullshit. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2082.2s)]
*  And I kept saying that that was bullshit [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2083.6s)]
*  and everybody fucking yelled at me [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2085.3199999999997s)]
*  and said I was pro-Russia. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2086.96s)]
*  Will those people go back and maybe think, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2089.0s)]
*  okay, maybe we were wrong and Assan was right? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2091.68s)]
*  No, they won't. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2094.8399999999997s)]
*  They'll continue saying I'm pro-Russia over and over again. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2095.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2098.92s)]
*  You know, obviously if you would expect changes [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2099.7599999999998s)]
*  amongst the public on feelings towards Ukraine, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2102.3199999999997s)]
*  feelings towards Zelensky have changed also dramatically. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2105.88s)]
*  Look at this confidence Zelensky will do the right thing [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2108.88s)]
*  when it comes to world affairs. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2111.56s)]
*  Back in 2022, it was the clear majority, 72% through the floor [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2112.92s)]
*  through the floor by 2024, just 48% of Americans [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2118.28s)]
*  say that they're confident that Zelensky will do [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2122.56s)]
*  the right thing when it comes to world affairs. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2124.56s)]
*  I think this also doesn't like this right here [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2126.44s)]
*  is not proof of anything other than manufacturer consent [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2130.56s)]
*  and its power. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2135.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2136.62s)]
*  Like not only, not only was Zelensky [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2138.44s)]
*  in charge of the wronged party, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2142.04s)]
*  it made Americans obviously feel like for once [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2144.8199999999997s)]
*  they were on the morally righteous side. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2147.2999999999997s)]
*  Even if it was for the wrong reasons, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2149.64s)]
*  they could shut you the fuck up [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2151.3199999999997s)]
*  because they could be like, no, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2153.3599999999997s)]
*  we're on the right side for once. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2154.24s)]
*  But also that's the reason why the media fucking pumped [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2156.72s)]
*  the Zelensky stuff everywhere. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2160.48s)]
*  It's also partially because the situation [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2162.64s)]
*  as far as the battlefield goes, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2166.74s)]
*  became impossible to propagandize over. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  You can't be like Ukraine is actually fucking winning [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2172.4399999999996s)]
*  this war over and over again [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2174.56s)]

*  Americans also fucking hate losers, okay? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2180.48s)]
*  And by that, I mean our own military as well. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2184.06s)]
*  They don't have endless appetite for death and destruction [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2187.2599999999998s)]
*  partially because it's always happening [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2189.98s)]
*  on the other side of the world. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2192.34s)]

*  Why do you think that we had to diminish our military [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2197.7s)]
*  in Iraq? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2202.18s)]

*  They keep it going for as long as they can, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2207.66s)]
*  but inevitably they have to fucking, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2209.84s)]

*  Some allies of president Trump have targeted Zelensky [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2235.9s)]
*  with harsh criticism over the last few years [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2239.02s)]
*  and it could be that that's having some impact here. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2241.2000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, the Republican establishment, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2244.22s)]
*  the Republican electorate has moved [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2245.82s)]
*  as the Republican establishment [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2247.74s)]
*  and Republican leaders have moved on. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2249.1s)]
*  Let's talk about the idea of a peace deal. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2251.02s)]
*  And again, the way you ask this matters, but go ahead. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2253.94s)]
*  The way you ask it is important. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2255.7799999999997s)]
*  So we can talk about this a little bit. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2257.42s)]
*  So the poll question essentially is, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2259.3s)]
*  do you support a Russia-Ukraine negotiated peace deal? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2260.88s)]
*  The vast majority of Americans, this is what they want. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2263.98s)]
*  78% say that they support this idea [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2266.2599999999998s)]
*  versus just 16% opposed. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2269.02s)]
*  Of course, as we were... [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2271.14s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2272.62s)]
*  What matters? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2273.46s)]
*  Why does it matter what the American public thinks? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2274.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't give a shit about this stuff [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2275.98s)]
*  when it comes to Palestinians. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2277.38s)]
*  Who gives a fuck, right? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2279.84s)]
*  That is the truth of it, by the way. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2282.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the American public thinks, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2284.22s)]
*  but you can always point to this to be like, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2286.9s)]
*  this is why Donald Trump is doing it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2288.7s)]
*  Talking about, does this question actually get out [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2290.9s)]
*  what's going on right now? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2294.14s)]
*  I think you would say that it probably [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2295.74s)]
*  does not necessarily get what's going out right now. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2297.66s)]
*  No, the question asked, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2299.9s)]
*  do you support a Russia-Ukraine negotiated peace deal? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2300.86s)]
*  Ukraine's not there at the negotiations [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2304.1400000000003s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia this week, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2306.7400000000002s)]
*  so the people were not asked this. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2308.28s)]
*  And I do think in general, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2309.6200000000003s)]
*  if you ask anyone in any poll, do you support peace? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2311.1400000000003s)]
*  Peace tends to rate pretty highly. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2315.08s)]
*  Peace tends to win. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2317.38s)]
*  You rarely get 78% of the country agreeing on anything. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2318.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2321.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there was another thing [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2322.98s)]
*  that 78% of the country agreed on. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2324.6200000000003s)]
*  They do agree on the idea of a negotiated peace deal [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2326.82s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2329.1s)]
*  whether the majority would agree [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2331.46s)]
*  on a Russia peace deal with Ukraine [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2332.42s)]
*  where Ukraine has nothing to do with it. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2334.22s)]
*  That might be a different question. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2336.18s)]
*  Hard to know. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2337.3799999999997s)]
*  Harriet, thank you. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2338.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2339.04s)]
*  Peace talks is in a betrayal though, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2340.62s)]
*  but I don't want to keep the war going. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2341.7s)]
*  That's a bigger betrayal. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2342.8199999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2344.58s)]
*  What betrayal? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2345.42s)]
*  Man betray Ukraine for giving them more weapons [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2346.2599999999998s)]
*  for keeping them losing. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2347.58s)]
*  This poll serves no purpose [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2348.42s)]
*  other than to legitimize our betrayal of Ukraine. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2350.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2352.74s)]
*  It is a betrayal. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2353.58s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2354.42s)]
*  Look, there was never gonna be like a NATO membership, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2355.66s)]
*  but the fact that they even had the audacity to dangle that [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2357.9s)]
*  as a carrot in front of the Ukrainian population was also, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2361.78s)]
*  obviously every single person that said [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2365.1s)]
*  that's not going to happen was treated [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2367.1800000000003s)]
*  like a fucking Adolf Pootler supporter. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2368.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, you love pootie poo. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2371.7400000000002s)]
*  You love pootie poo. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2372.94s)]
*  Is this shocking to me that Trump is doing all this? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2374.2200000000003s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2376.98s)]
*  You want to know why it's not shocking? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2378.26s)]
*  Because this was inevitable. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2380.26s)]
*  As I always say, if you come in here, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2382.42s)]
*  it's not going to, you know, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2384.2200000000003s)]
*  events that unfold eventually, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2386.02s)]
*  especially as it pertains to American foreign policy [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2388.5s)]
*  will not be shocking to you with the notable exception [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2389.66s)]
*  of Vladimir Putin will never invade Ukraine [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2391.74s)]
*  because that is a historic failure for himself [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2394.14s)]
*  and incredibly violent for everyone else. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2398.4199999999996s)]
*  One, they had a summit trying to address some issues of. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2400.98s)]
*  Also another part of this process [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2404.2999999999997s)]
*  that I will at least admit I was wrong on [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2406.02s)]
*  is the fact that the Vivek Ramaswamy sentiment [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2408.74s)]
*  and the Tucker Carlson sentiment [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2412.62s)]
*  about we must use Russia against China [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2414.58s)]
*  is unironically the position, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2417.98s)]
*  is unironically the fucking position [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2419.46s)]
*  that these guys are like trying to say [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2422.5s)]
*  is the next step forward for foreign policy. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2426.34s)]
*  Tension in the US Russia relationship. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2429.82s)]
*  And I think this also goes to the point [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2432.3s)]
*  that President Biden did not seek a conflict with Russia. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2434.06s)]
*  There were efforts made to avert the invasion. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2438.1800000000003s)]
*  There was very. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2440.6200000000003s)]
*  You support Vivek? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2441.46s)]
*  No, I don't fucking support a war against China, chat. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2442.3s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2444.7400000000002s)]
*  Intensive diplomacy between the US and Russia. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2445.86s)]
*  Also between the US's allies, Germany, France, UK, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2448.5800000000004s)]
*  and Russia leading up to the February 2022 invasion. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2452.1800000000003s)]
*  And I think it's worth taking that into account. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2456.3s)]
*  Now, should more have been done perhaps we can't know [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2458.26s)]
*  but I think Vladimir Putin has told us repeatedly [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2461.26s)]
*  about his very expansive goals [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2464.86s)]
*  and what he really hopes to achieve in Ukraine. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2466.9s)]
*  And it's not just about NATO. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2470.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, this should not be news to anyone here. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2471.9s)]
*  Again, getting back to the talks in Saudi Arabia, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2475.1400000000003s)]
*  if there is a workable peace agreement to be had, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2477.6200000000003s)]
*  that's good. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2480.54s)]
*  But I do think even the fact that these talks [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2481.58s)]
*  are happening between the United States and Russia, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2484.46s)]
*  that is a victory for Putin. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2488.06s)]
*  We have to understand that Putin's vision for Russia's role [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2489.46s)]
*  and for the eventual dispensation for Ukraine. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2493.42s)]
*  I hate this. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2497.46s)]
*  I don't like this narrative like, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2498.3s)]
*  oh, we're rewarding Putin, we're rewarding Putin. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2499.98s)]
*  No, man. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2502.5s)]
*  There's no, this is the same shit that Israel says, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2503.78s)]
*  we're rewarding Hamas if we do a ceasefire. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2507.7400000000002s)]
*  Or I guess if from the pro-Palestinian perspective, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2512.26s)]
*  it would be like, oh, we're rewarding Israel [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2517.6600000000003s)]
*  if we do a ceasefire. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2520.1400000000003s)]
*  No, just stop. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2521.38s)]
*  Just stop the conflict, please. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2522.82s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2525.02s)]
*  What do you mean rewarding a person? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2525.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2528.18s)]
*  You can't use morality to change the field of battle. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2529.02s)]
*  It literally doesn't work. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2534.3s)]
*  I want it to work, but it doesn't work that way. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2535.54s)]
*  But your whole solution seems very short-sighted. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2538.18s)]
*  I can agree that Ukrainians deserve no more fighting, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2540.02s)]
*  but what does that do when Russia just knows [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2541.9s)]
*  they can go in anywhere? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2543.3s)]
*  Honest question. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2544.14s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2545.34s)]
*  And I don't know what the answer to that question is. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2546.22s)]
*  I genuinely don't know, okay? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2548.06s)]
*  Russia invading Ukraine has already justified [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2550.94s)]
*  the existence of NATO for many other regional partners [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2554.22s)]

*  Okay? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2562.1400000000003s)]
*  I think if I'm gonna close my eyes and think like [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2562.98s)]
*  how this unfolded this way, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2566.6600000000003s)]
*  I think that Vladimir Putin is smarter than Donald Trump. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2569.98s)]
*  And as a person that is smarter than Donald Trump, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2575.34s)]
*  that knows that Donald Trump reveres him [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2577.98s)]
*  to a certain degree, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2580.7000000000003s)]
*  he used that influence he has over Donald Trump [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2582.38s)]
*  to his advantage by actively making him undermine Ukraine. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2584.62s)]
*  Donald Trump was already ready to undermine Ukraine [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2590.66s)]
*  because there is a lot of appetite [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2593.54s)]
*  within the American Republican population [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2595.7s)]
*  in terms of cutting aside any sort of allegiance or loyalty [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2599.62s)]
*  that Americans have to Ukraine. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2604.7s)]
*  And that's the reason why Zelensky [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2607.54s)]
*  is not a part of these talks, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2609.9s)]
*  because at the end of the day, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2611.7s)]
*  you're the United States of fucking America. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2613.78s)]
*  What do you mean Ukraine doesn't get a seat at the table? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2616.5800000000004s)]
*  If you wanted to, you could have brought Zelensky there [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2619.82s)]
*  and put his nutsack on the fucking table. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2622.82s)]
*  Do you think Vladimir Putin would say no Zelensky [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2625.5400000000004s)]
*  if America truly wished for Zelensky to be at the table? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2628.94s)]

*  I think that Vladimir Putin wanted to optically [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2634.1400000000003s)]
*  fuck over Zelensky to potentially further [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2637.9s)]
*  destabilize Ukrainian politics to make Ukrainians by force [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2641.34s)]
*  understand the reality that they have no say in this process. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2646.1000000000004s)]
*  And Donald Trump being someone who is definitely, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2650.7000000000003s)]
*  I think, persuadable, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2658.2200000000003s)]
*  especially by the likes of someone like Vladimir Putin, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2660.1800000000003s)]
*  played ball thinking that he was gonna get [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2663.2200000000003s)]
*  a great deal out of this. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2665.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2666.82s)]
*  That's what I think, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2669.6600000000003s)]
*  because whether Zelensky is at this table [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2670.82s)]
*  or Zelensky is not at this table [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2673.6600000000003s)]
*  does not change the dynamic of this back and forth. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2675.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2678.78s)]
*  It's still very much in the hands [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2679.6200000000003s)]
*  of the United States of America [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2682.1800000000003s)]
*  to decide how this is going to happen. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2684.3s)]
*  Russia and the United States are the primary parties here. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2687.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2691.6600000000003s)]
*  Because no matter how much liberalism [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2692.5s)]
*  because no matter how much liberals yell at me [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2695.02s)]
*  for saying this, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2697.66s)]
*  it is still very much a proxy war. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2698.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2702.2599999999998s)]
*  And it's not just me saying that [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2703.14s)]
*  whenever the likes of Senator Blumenthal [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2705.54s)]
*  or Liz Warren or Lindsey Graham [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2709.06s)]
*  or numerous other foreign policy liberals [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2713.2599999999998s)]
*  and Republicans both repeat the reality [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2716.22s)]
*  that this was a fantastic bargain for us [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2719.78s)]
*  because for 5% of our military budget, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2722.54s)]
*  we were able to undermine a foreign adversaries military [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2725.7400000000002s)]
*  by 50%. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2728.0600000000004s)]
*  I'd say that's a great deal, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2729.6200000000003s)]
*  especially when you consider that not a single American [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2731.1000000000004s)]
*  soldier had to die in the process. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2733.5800000000004s)]
*  They mean it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2735.5400000000004s)]
*  They mean that shit. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2736.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2738.46s)]
*  The American military industrial complex [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2741.7000000000003s)]
*  was able to offload a lot of weapons in the process. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2743.9s)]
*  American businesses were able to take advantage [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2750.02s)]
*  of the fire sale that took place inside of Ukraine. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2753.74s)]
*  And they will continue to gut Ukraine [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2758.4199999999996s)]
*  for all that remains in this process. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2761.06s)]
*  They took the maximum advantage. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2764.62s)]
*  America won out like a fucking bandit [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2766.9799999999996s)]
*  from Vladimir Putin's mistake. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2770.02s)]
*  They won, beefed up loyalties for NATO, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2772.2599999999998s)]
*  justified the existence of NATO, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2776.5s)]
*  brought two other nations into NATO. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2778.3799999999997s)]
*  Number two, we're able to cut off Europeans [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2780.9s)]
*  from utilizing Russian gas, undermining their economy, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2786.2200000000003s)]
*  just completely destabilizing them [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2790.3s)]
*  without any care whatsoever. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2792.06s)]
*  And then forcing their hand to purchase American gas. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2793.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2797.86s)]
*  And of course, last but not least, most significantly, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2799.1800000000003s)]
*  they were able to sell a bunch, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2801.98s)]
*  offshore a bunch of fucking weapons. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2803.42s)]
*  That's it. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2807.98s)]
*  America is the party that makes out like a bandit here. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2809.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2813.7000000000003s)]
*  Far more than Russia did. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2814.9s)]
*  Having said that, if you think that like, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2818.6600000000003s)]
*  whether Zelensky is at this table or not, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2821.2200000000003s)]
*  changes the dynamic of the back and forth, you're wrong. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2824.34s)]
*  Okay. You're wrong. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2828.94s)]
*  That's not, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2830.0600000000004s)]
*  this was still always going to be [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2832.2200000000003s)]
*  whatever America says goes. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2833.7000000000003s)]
*  But I do think the reason why they cut Zelensky [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2835.58s)]
*  out of this equation was to give a symbolic W [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2843.02s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2847.98s)]
*  And Vladimir Putin, one, was very able to, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2849.62s)]
*  was able to very successfully create pro-Russia sentiment [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2853.58s)]
*  amongst the dumbest of American hogs, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2857.9s)]
*  who for their entire lives despised Russia [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2861.06s)]
*  and the red commies, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2864.62s)]
*  only to get brainbroken by one fucking telegram group. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2866.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2872.14s)]
*  And develop loyalties for Russia somehow. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2873.2599999999998s)]
*  But also they were able to take advantage [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2877.54s)]
*  of the lack of appetite Americans, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2879.94s)]
*  many Americans have due to their selfishness [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2882.94s)]
*  in many instances to constant war that's happening [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2885.98s)]
*  and constant destabilization that's happening. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2888.9s)]
*  They were able to also create a massive inflation crisis [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2891.74s)]
*  in the United States of America through OPEC+, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2896.7s)]
*  which the American oil manufacturers, oil producers, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2899.74s)]
*  also played ball with because as they openly stated, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2903.22s)]
*  time and time again, that they had no interest [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2907.4599999999996s)]
*  in doing what was best for the American population, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2910.2599999999998s)]
*  despite the billions of dollars in subsidies [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2913.4599999999996s)]
*  that they were receiving from the American government [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2915.8599999999997s)]
*  and that OPEC pluses limitations on oil barrels [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2918.22s)]
*  was actually to their benefit. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2922.2999999999997s)]
*  And it really was to their benefit. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2925.3799999999997s)]
*  They made more money in this process. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2926.7799999999997s)]
*  So they were able to destabilize America [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2931.8599999999997s)]
*  and create a lot of anger and resentment towards Biden, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2937.3399999999997s)]
*  create a lot of it understandably, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2940.3799999999997s)]
*  which Biden did to himself as well, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2942.4199999999996s)]
*  because he's just an incompetent fucking cadaver. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2944.06s)]
*  They were then also simultaneously able to [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2947.02s)]
*  basically get Donald Trump to play ball this way [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2949.58s)]
*  and even symbolically fuck over Ukraine [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2952.18s)]
*  because America was always fucking over Ukraine. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2955.18s)]
*  But now it's in broad daylight. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2958.3s)]
*  Bro, the Russian diplomat team is stacked [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2965.98s)]
*  and the American one is a real estate developer. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2967.5s)]
*  That's fucking Steve's goddamn name. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2969.02s)]
*  He is the great peacekeeper, okay? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2970.78s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2974.18s)]
*  That's Steve fucking Witkoff, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2975.62s)]
*  Donald Trump's golfing partner, okay? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2977.1s)]

*  That's my goat right there. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2981.38s)]
*  Yeah, the Witkoff factor as they're calling it. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2982.98s)]
*  Yeah, Vladimir Putin has probably never been so scared [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2985.74s)]
*  and also turned on at the same time [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2988.58s)]
*  until he sat across the table [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2990.2599999999998s)]
*  from American real estate developer [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2991.42s)]

*  Look at Lavrov, he's shaking in his boots. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2996.2999999999997s)]
*  He does not know the brilliant mind of Steve Witkoff. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=2998.5s)]
*  He will learn. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3003.7799999999997s)]
*  The great thing about Ukraine is that this is something [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3005.18s)]
*  to be worked out between Russia and the United States, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3007.1s)]
*  between these two great powers. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3009.2599999999998s)]
*  He sees Russia as a rising force. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3011.3s)]
*  Again, he's trying to kind of reestablish Russia [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3013.66s)]
*  as a great empire, a great force in global affairs. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3016.82s)]
*  And his vision of how global affairs should work [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3020.02s)]
*  is that the great powers make decisions [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3022.2599999999998s)]
*  and the lesser powers just have to deal with it. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3024.74s)]
*  Their concerns are of very little concern. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3026.86s)]
*  And unfortunately, I think that is something [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3030.46s)]
*  we've seen from the Trump administration too, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3032.38s)]
*  whether it's Ukraine, whether it's Gaza, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3034.3s)]
*  it's that the powerful make decisions [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3036.82s)]
*  and the weak just deal with it. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3038.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't think- [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3041.7000000000003s)]
*  That is what it is. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3042.54s)]

*  How does this always happen? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3148.22s)]
*  The worst aspect of this is that [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3151.4s)]
*  the worst conditions get for American empire, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3153.1600000000003s)]

*  we're gonna fucking lash out out as we just die out, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3159.88s)]
*  but the death of an empire doesn't happen overnight [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3164.0800000000004s)]
*  and it certainly doesn't happen quietly. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3166.6000000000004s)]
*  I really did think the one guy we could put on this list [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3168.76s)]
*  was maybe Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3171.32s)]
*  but he has held strong, baby, holy shit. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3172.76s)]
*  That's just, and more importantly, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3175.8s)]
*  I don't think that's going to lead to a sustainable peace. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3177.5s)]
*  So listen, if they do come out of these talks [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3181.32s)]
*  with a workable and sustainable [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3184.12s)]
*  and durable peace agreement for Ukraine, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3185.96s)]
*  one that protects Ukraine's democracy, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3188.6s)]
*  one that protects Ukraine's sovereignty, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3190.32s)]
*  we should all support that. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3192.88s)]
*  But without the participation of Ukraine, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3195.14s)]
*  I'm very, very skeptical [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3198.0s)]
*  that we're gonna get anything like that. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3200.2400000000002s)]
*  And Jeff Sachs, what about that? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3202.92s)]
*  This, it is the Ukrainians who are actually fighting [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3204.56s)]
*  against Russia and yet the Trump administration [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3210.52s)]
*  seems to feel that it can negotiate [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3214.2s)]
*  without a Ukrainian's present. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3216.96s)]
*  And in addition, I wanted to ask you another issue. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3219.2799999999997s)]
*  There's been a lot of emphasis [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3223.2s)]
*  on these rare earth minerals that Trump raised, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3224.4s)]
*  but there has been, according to many reports, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3227.32s)]
*  massive buying of Ukrainian land [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3229.92s)]
*  by American agribusiness companies. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3233.6s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about that? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3237.12s)]
*  The validity of these claims? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3239.08s)]
*  Sure, the American role in this has been quite sorted [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3242.2799999999997s)]
*  for a very, very long time. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3247.08s)]
*  The goal starting back in 1994 was to expand NATO [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3250.32s)]
*  and surround Russia in the Black Sea region. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3255.4s)]
*  President Clinton signed off on that in 1994. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3258.96s)]
*  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote about it [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3264.6s)]
*  in the Grand Chessboard in 1997, explaining it. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3267.48s)]
*  And explaining in a chapter that is completely wrong [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3271.64s)]
*  when you look back at it, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3276.88s)]
*  said Russia will not be able to resist any of this. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3278.28s)]
*  In 2002, the US destabilized the relationship [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3283.76s)]
*  by unilaterally abandoning the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3288.64s)]
*  In 2008, the United States invited Ukraine and Georgia [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3293.6s)]
*  to join NATO. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3298.6s)]
*  Basically, oh, that's my goat, George W. Bush, baby. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3299.88s)]
*  GWB, still the number one bad guy. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3302.64s)]
*  Like actually, his administration is still the worst. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3305.7999999999997s)]
*  Still worse than Donald Trump, which is crazy [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3308.7599999999998s)]
*  because Donald Trump is doing a lot of stuff [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3310.7999999999997s)]
*  that might put him above W, finally, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3313.48s)]
*  because he didn't come anywhere near close to W's death [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3316.72s)]
*  and destruction and destabilization. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3319.68s)]
*  The first time around, but it's kind of crazy [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3323.88s)]
*  because a lot of people forget all the stuff that GW did [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3327.0s)]
*  at the end of his tenure. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3332.04s)]
*  Okay, obviously you had the housing market crash and stuff too, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3334.96s)]
*  which kind of made people forget this, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3338.68s)]
*  but like George W. Bush is literally, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3342.04s)]
*  George W. Bush's administration, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3346.32s)]
*  George W. Bush's administration destabilized [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3349.44s)]
*  the Palestinian position even further [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3352.6s)]
*  by forcing them to have an election [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3354.52s)]
*  when their own guys, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3357.08s)]
*  like the Fatah people were like, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3361.24s)]
*  we're not ready for an election. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3362.6s)]
*  The Palestinian population hate us. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3363.7999999999997s)]
*  We will lose this election. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3365.16s)]
*  And they did, they lost the Hamas [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3366.4s)]
*  as the American backed Fatah correctly called out. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3370.2799999999997s)]
*  Then George W. Bush was like, oh shit, you guys lost? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3376.56s)]
*  Okay, well, all right. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3379.72s)]
*  I guess it's time to do a coup, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3381.4s)]
*  which then caused Hamas to solidify their position. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3383.12s)]
*  Okay, that's the Palestine stuff. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3388.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay, that's the Palestine part of the equation. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3390.4s)]
*  On the other side, George W. Bush on his way out, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3393.08s)]
*  literally said we should let Georgia and Ukraine into NATO. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3395.32s)]
*  Okay, that's what he said. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3401.04s)]
*  Just leaving off as he's like, you know what would be great [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3403.44s)]
*  as my final act after so much death and destruction, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3407.36s)]
*  so much destabilization, okay, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3413.76s)]
*  we should let Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3416.6400000000003s)]
*  And then of course, predictably Russia hearing that was like, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3422.28s)]
*  fuck, no, you won't. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3425.92s)]
*  And then they immediately took a part of Georgia, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3427.52s)]
*  immediately, like right after. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3430.6400000000003s)]
*  And they were like, no, that's not fucking happening. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3433.48s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3435.6400000000003s)]
*  They went over strong objections by the Europeans, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3436.56s)]
*  but the Europeans went along [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3438.68s)]
*  in the NATO Bucharest Summit in 2008 [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3440.4s)]
*  over Russia's brightest red lines. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3446.04s)]
*  This was all known, understood provocations. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3448.72s)]
*  All of the diplomats knew it, European leaders knew it. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3452.92s)]
*  I spoke with them at the time. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3456.64s)]
*  Everybody understood this. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3458.88s)]
*  In February, 2014, the United States participated actively [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3460.8s)]
*  in a violent coup to overthrow Viktor Yanukovych, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3466.4s)]
*  the president of Ukraine, who favored neutrality. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3470.7200000000003s)]
*  This is very important to understand. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3475.04s)]
*  The coup took place on February 22nd, 2014. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3476.88s)]
*  Again, I saw some of this with my own eyes. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3480.48s)]
*  It was ugly, the US involvement in this coup. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3484.4s)]
*  US forces paid for this coup to an important extent. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3489.92s)]
*  They stirred up this coup. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3495.7200000000003s)]
*  This is all well understood now in 2015. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3498.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3505.0s)]
*  I don't know if he was in favor of neutrality. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3506.12s)]
*  I think he was, Ukraine has been stuck [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3509.44s)]
*  between the Western sphere of influence [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3511.52s)]
*  and Russian sphere of influence [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3513.6800000000003s)]
*  with no real pathway towards actual absolute sovereignty [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3515.48s)]
*  in perpetuity, okay? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3522.12s)]
*  While there are certainly state elements [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3524.4s)]
*  that took part of the revolutions [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3526.92s)]
*  that were happening all around the world [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3532.32s)]
*  and certainly in Ukraine as well, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3533.6s)]
*  there was also plenty of anger and resentment [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3535.32s)]
*  towards Yanukovych as well. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3538.04s)]
*  This is something that I mention all the fucking time. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3540.96s)]
*  America does not have like magical mystical powers [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3544.36s)]
*  of just like automatically creating resentment [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3548.36s)]
*  amongst the population. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3551.2000000000003s)]
*  No matter how much USAID funding [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3552.8s)]
*  and no matter how many NGOs and civil society organizations [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3556.28s)]
*  that they run, own and operate inside of countries [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3561.4s)]
*  that they want to influence, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3565.96s)]
*  there has to be real anger and real resentment, okay? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3568.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not magic, it's just the CIA. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3574.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I think this is the left position [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3576.0800000000004s)]
*  that I think deserves more nuance [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3578.92s)]
*  that left is also automatically give so much credit [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3582.52s)]
*  to CIA over. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3585.64s)]
*  Color revolutions are not as simple [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3587.08s)]
*  in the way that a lot of leftists claim they happen, okay? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3589.36s)]
*  Like, I guess I'm a centrist in this regard, okay? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3595.48s)]
*  I'm a centrist when it comes to color revolutions [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3600.7599999999998s)]
*  in the sense that there are real resentments, real anger, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3603.28s)]
*  real frustration from the population [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3608.04s)]
*  and then the CIA or other State Department elements [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3610.32s)]
*  or sometimes it's a homegrown reactionary movement [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3613.48s)]
*  that overtakes these movements [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3619.36s)]
*  and uses them in the interest of American empire. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3622.6800000000003s)]
*  USAIDs fuel to the fire, it does not create the fire. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3627.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3630.4s)]
*  Clinton was caught on tape [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3632.1600000000003s)]
*  talking about designing the coup government. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3633.36s)]
*  It was definitely a CIA op. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3634.6800000000003s)]
*  There was a basis of support for the coup, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3635.84s)]
*  especially in the more cosmopolitan section [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3637.0800000000004s)]
*  of the Western part of Ukraine, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3638.6800000000003s)]
*  but it was a coup even if the coup government [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3639.64s)]
*  had lots of support. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3641.64s)]
*  Yeah, but you still can't. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3643.88s)]
*  I wouldn't say that Yanukovych was favoring neutrality [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3645.92s)]
*  and you also still can't say that there wasn't real resentment [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3648.96s)]
*  towards the existing form of governance. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3652.36s)]
*  Now, the irony of course is that Ukraine [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3654.88s)]
*  has never really had a non-corrupt government, okay? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3657.08s)]
*  The Zelensky government was also very corrupt [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3660.4s)]
*  and this is not my assessment. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3665.24s)]
*  The only reason why I know about this shit [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3666.7599999999998s)]
*  is because at the time before the invasion of Ukraine, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3668.96s)]
*  there were plenty of foreign policy papers [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3674.88s)]
*  that actively talked about how corrupt [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3678.16s)]
*  the Ukrainian government was. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3680.52s)]
*  Of course, all of that went away [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3682.76s)]
*  when Vladimir Putin did the unthinkable [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3684.44s)]
*  and the absolute immoral move of invading Ukraine. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3687.44s)]
*  He was favoring the better deal. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3692.44s)]
*  The Russian loans have better terms [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3693.6s)]
*  than the IMF loans being pushed by the US and EU. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3694.84s)]
*  The IMF and US wanted privatizations [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3696.88s)]
*  of state-owned enterprise and cost the heating assistance. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3698.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, they got it, they got it. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3700.8s)]
*  The West ultimately won, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3703.6000000000004s)]
*  partially because articles written [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3705.48s)]
*  by Russian-bought propagandas, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3708.2400000000002s)]
*  yeah, articles written by Russian-bought propagandas [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3709.88s)]
*  like Foreign Policy Magazine or, I don't know, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3712.52s)]
*  even fucking Voice of America, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3715.88s)]
*  which is literally operated by the CIA, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3717.6000000000004s)]
*  was talking about how fucking corrupt. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3719.76s)]
*  The Center for Investigative Reporting, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3722.1600000000003s)]
*  or what is it, the International Consortium of Journalists [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3724.68s)]
*  and ProPublica are not Russian-bought propagandas. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3727.6s)]
*  They're just actively, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3732.24s)]
*  the Panama Papers were not fucking Russian-bought propagandas [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3733.92s)]
*  when they investigated a million different, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3737.56s)]
*  investigated all of this corruption and offshoring [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3742.64s)]
*  that both Zelensky and his administration [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3745.96s)]
*  and many other governments were engaging in. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3748.64s)]
*  The idea that nobody wrote about Ukrainian corruption [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3751.8s)]
*  and the only people that wrote about it [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3755.48s)]
*  were Russian-bought propagandas is ridiculous, okay? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3757.32s)]
*  Voice of America, nothing compared to the evil of RT. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3760.56s)]
*  No, they operate in the same exact way. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3763.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3765.04s)]
*  They are literally the same, yeah. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3767.48s)]
*  Anyway, even if it was in the U.S. interest with the coup, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3770.08s)]
*  you can't say there wasn't overwhelming grassroots sentiment. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3786.7999999999997s)]
*  No, that is what I'm saying. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3788.88s)]
*  That's precisely my point. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3790.04s)]
*  I'm saying that there was definitely real support [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3791.52s)]
*  on the ground for change. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3795.4s)]
*  I think that saying that there wasn't is ridiculous. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3797.28s)]
*  But once again, especially with the case of Ukraine, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3801.36s)]
*  America's involvement in these countries [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3804.84s)]
*  is rarely for real, moral, ultimately good reasons. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3807.6400000000003s)]
*  It's never for the good reasons. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3811.7200000000003s)]
*  It's for this reason, because this means you have to, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3814.36s)]
*  you have to privatize all of your state-owned enterprise. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3818.88s)]
*  You have to sell it to foreign capital, okay? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3822.4s)]
*  That's it. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3825.0s)]
*  Things that Trump is doing right now, by the way. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3826.2400000000002s)]
*  Things that Trump is doing right now [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3828.44s)]
*  that is the reason why I say America is the one [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3831.44s)]
*  that won the most out of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3835.84s)]
*  The war could have ended with the Minsk 2 agreements, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3839.4s)]
*  but the United States and Ukraine, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3842.84s)]
*  despite the U.N. Security Council backing, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3844.88s)]
*  said, no, you don't have to do that. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3848.32s)]
*  That was not a territorial claim on the Donbas by Russia. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3850.6000000000004s)]
*  It was a claim for autonomy [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3854.12s)]
*  that the U.N. Security Council unanimously supported [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3856.56s)]
*  in the U.S. and the governments in Ukraine at the U.S. behest, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3860.68s)]
*  to an important extent. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3865.92s)]
*  Yeah, not for good reasons, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3867.3199999999997s)]
*  but why is Trump suddenly bending the knee of Russia [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3868.2s)]
*  instead of continuing the war? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3870.2s)]
*  Wait, what? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3871.36s)]
*  No, America's interest in Ukraine [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3872.48s)]
*  isn't just to undermine the Russian influence in the country. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3874.7999999999997s)]
*  Russia already gave them that massive W, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3882.2s)]
*  gave America that massive W. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3885.12s)]
*  America's interest is money. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3888.12s)]
*  Donald Trump, when he says, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3890.04s)]
*  we're going to take all your natural resources, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3892.3199999999997s)]
*  is basically trying to take whatever remains of the, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3896.16s)]
*  whatever remains of Ukraine's resources, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3902.3199999999997s)]
*  whatever remains as a sector of profit from Ukraine. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3904.2799999999997s)]
*  That's it. And it's not like he's hiding it. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3908.08s)]
*  He's just, he doesn't have the capacity to fucking, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3910.08s)]
*  he doesn't have the capacity to engage in any sort of song [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3912.96s)]
*  and dance. He just like very openly says [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3917.08s)]
*  what he's thinking at any given moment. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3919.04s)]
*  If Ukraine still had more manpower to throw at the problem [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3926.0s)]
*  without truly collapsing, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3930.56s)]
*  because they now have to draw from much younger population of men, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3932.68s)]
*  then Trump would have continued the war. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3938.4s)]
*  It's that simple. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3940.68s)]
*  He'll take the resources, whether Ukrainian's fight or not. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3941.7999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine simply doesn't have the manpower. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3945.48s)]
*  This is something that I've been talking about [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3947.68s)]
*  for the past fucking year at this point. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3948.96s)]
*  Doesn't that benefit Russia long-term wise? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3950.96s)]
*  You destroy Ukraine, pass the Americans to pick it apart [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3952.96s)]
*  even more than the population will fall back into Russian arms? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3955.2799999999997s)]
*  Not really. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3957.8799999999997s)]
*  And also America's never been exactly, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3958.8799999999997s)]
*  America's never had foresight capabilities, I think, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3962.1600000000003s)]
*  when it comes to its foreign policy. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3968.1600000000003s)]
*  We don't give a shit about the long-term. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3970.44s)]
*  We care about the short-term. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3973.1600000000003s)]
*  Completely dissed. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3974.88s)]
*  And then it's true that Biden and Putin met in 2021, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3976.4s)]
*  but in December, 2021, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3984.4s)]
*  President Putin put on the table a draft [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3988.3999999999996s)]
*  U.S.-Russia security agreement. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3990.8799999999997s)]
*  It was a completely negotiable document. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3995.6s)]
*  I spent quite a bit of time speaking with the White House [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=3998.56s)]
*  about that document. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4002.16s)]
*  There should have been negotiations. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4004.2s)]
*  The U.S. rejected negotiation over the central point, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4006.56s)]
*  which was non-NATO enlargement to Ukraine. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4011.8799999999997s)]
*  Biden knew what he was doing. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4015.8s)]
*  It was a terrible mistake, terrible mistake, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4018.6000000000004s)]
*  of the Democrats, let me say, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4023.28s)]
*  and of President Biden and his team. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4026.2000000000003s)]
*  Then in March 2022, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4029.28s)]
*  just days after the start of Russia's invasion, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4032.4s)]
*  but by the way, the war had been going on for years, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4037.6800000000003s)]
*  but this escalation in starting February 22, 2022, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4041.0s)]
*  just days after that, they went to the negotiating table, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4046.76s)]
*  and they came very close to an agreement [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4052.4s)]
*  until the U.S. and Britain stopped it. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4055.76s)]
*  Bojo, Boris Johnson, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4060.16s)]
*  one of the most irresponsible politicians [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4061.92s)]
*  in our modern time, explained it explicitly later. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4064.48s)]
*  He said, this is a war about preserving Western hegemony. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4068.84s)]
*  Yes, this was a proxy war against Russia. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4074.36s)]
*  This was the plan all along. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4076.88s)]
*  And the U.S. and U.K. talked or told Zelensky base. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4079.8s)]
*  Again, as I said earlier, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4084.84s)]
*  I went to Ankara to discuss this in detail with the diplomats. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4086.84s)]
*  I know the details of what happened. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4092.92s)]
*  Ukraine left the negotiations. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4095.76s)]
*  The Boris Johnson argument is still being spewed. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4099.12s)]
*  I've never heard a decent counter to why Boris Johnson [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4101.88s)]
*  was not simply reasserting America's position to Ukraine [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4106.04s)]
*  and how that played a role. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4111.88s)]
*  Like, what's the counter to that? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4113.68s)]
*  That Russia was never interested in the ceasefire at that point at all? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4115.360000000001s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4119.04s)]
*  I don't know why people always get mad at that. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4120.08s)]
*  Like, they just... [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4123.16s)]
*  People got mad at me for saying that when it was happening at the time, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4124.76s)]
*  because the conditions the Russians said, I were fucking insane, were they? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4128.48s)]
*  Because they had less territory back then. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4132.32s)]
*  Now they're taking more territory. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4135.36s)]
*  But also simultaneously, like, there were plenty of... [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4138.08s)]
*  There was assurances from the Zelensky side that I thought was a pretty good deal. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4142.5599999999995s)]
*  You... [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4146.76s)]
*  If Donald... [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4147.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you something right now. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4148.5199999999995s)]
*  If Donald Trump were to be able to take the negotiations back to that 15-point plan, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4150.0s)]
*  OK? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4156.44s)]
*  Even liberals would be like, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4157.72s)]
*  wow, I can't believe how much territory he gave back to Ukraine, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4159.2s)]
*  how much territory he captured for Ukraine. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4162.6s)]
*  That's what they would say, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4164.68s)]
*  because that was objectively a better time to do a deal. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4165.72s)]
*  OK? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4168.52s)]
*  This is the take you lose me on. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4169.96s)]
*  Chatters never follow up back to this. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4173.28s)]
*  The only absurd term Russia had was giving complete disarmament. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4175.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's never gonna happen. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4177.84s)]
*  I will also say they were asking for land they did not control, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4178.96s)]
*  which is a non-starter for Ukraine. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4182.04s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't even fucking finish the talks. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4183.8s)]
*  Like, the talks never actually came to fruition. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4188.0s)]
*  Yes, there are non-starters on the Russian position for sure. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4191.32s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4194.56s)]
*  It's meaningless. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4195.44s)]
*  Yeah, of course Russia's gonna say that. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4197.04s)]
*  That doesn't mean anything. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4198.32s)]
*  Could have ended this in March 2022 with few deaths, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4199.36s)]
*  and instead there have been nearly a million deaths since then. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4205.24s)]
*  This has been, unfortunately, a game of the United States for 30 years [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4209.88s)]
*  that Zbigniew Brzezinski spelled out in 1997. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4216.44s)]
*  The US thought that... [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4220.44s)]
*  That take, so let Russia have land that don't belong to them? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4221.639999999999s)]
*  When did I say that, man? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4225.599999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4227.48s)]
*  He even said that he would hold a referendum 15 years later about Crimea, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4229.12s)]
*  which is a way to basically push the conversation back to a position [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4234.0s)]
*  where without like conceding that he's fully giving up on Crimea. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4237.88s)]
*  OK, is that what you guys are talking about in terms of like land acquisition [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4243.0s)]
*  that doesn't belong to them or some shit? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4246.44s)]
*  Jeff Sachs sounds like a Russian apologist. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4248.16s)]
*  He really said nothing critical about them. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4249.84s)]
*  It's all the way. Yeah, you should. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4251.28s)]
*  Yeah, you should have seen what this man used to do. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4253.4800000000005s)]
*  You should have. You should have heard Jeffrey Sachs in the 90s. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4256.4s)]
*  OK, this man is perhaps most responsible for the... [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4259.0s)]
*  For what came after the collapse of the USSR. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4263.44s)]
*  They had the upper hand at every time. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4267.4s)]
*  It was the economic sanctions or the weapons that were going to bring Russia to its knees. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4269.36s)]
*  It was incredibly naive. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4275.4s)]
*  I said so for many, many years. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4277.4s)]
*  Professor Sachs. I said Ukraine... [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4279.639999999999s)]
*  Everyone knows Hassan is a Pootler dick rider. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4281.719999999999s)]
*  What did he say again before Pootler invaded? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4283.839999999999s)]
*  Ask yourself why you have to point to something, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4286.679999999999s)]
*  which was an incorrect prediction from three years ago and not anything else [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4290.68s)]
*  in the three year framework. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4296.12s)]
*  Do you think that this is an appropriate way to analyze my position or, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4298.0s)]
*  you know, or any number of different things that I've said and done [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4303.64s)]
*  before and after? Ridiculous. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4307.6s)]
*  I said Ukraine will become the Afghanistan of Europe, and so it has. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4310.4800000000005s)]
*  Now, today in Saudi Arabia, maybe Ukraine can be saved from what the US deep state [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4315.64s)]
*  set along the path of the last 25 years. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4323.160000000001s)]
*  And this is the biggest hope of today. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4326.96s)]
*  Professor Sachs, Matt Duss said he agreed with a lot of what you said. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4329.0s)]
*  And I was wondering... [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4332.92s)]
*  You've always said this is Pootler invading and taking back Ruskie lands. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4333.68s)]
*  OK, well, yeah, never mind. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4337.160000000001s)]
*  I didn't realize this chatter was just... [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4339.64s)]
*  I didn't realize this chatter was just simply hallucinating. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4342.08s)]
*  If you agree with him in condemning Russia's invasion in 2022. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4345.04s)]
*  Of course I condemn Russia's invasion. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4350.64s)]
*  And of course I condemn the reasons for the provocation. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4353.2s)]
*  I condemn the destabilization of the nuclear framework, which was the most of all in this. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4357.68s)]
*  The United States walked out of the ABM Treaty and the Intermediate Nuclear Force Treaty [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4363.72s)]
*  unilaterally and would not negotiate with the Russia. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4369.12s)]
*  Remember when he said Pootler opened the oldest vault? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4371.72s)]
*  OK, that is true. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4373.84s)]
*  He did open it. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4374.6s)]
*  That's facts. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4375.56s)]
*  Russians over this. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4376.4800000000005s)]
*  The United States overthrew a government in Ukraine. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4377.72s)]
*  The United States refused to negotiate with the Russians over basic security issues. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4380.8s)]
*  This is a tragedy. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4387.400000000001s)]
*  But the core of the tragedy is U.S. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4388.92s)]
*  unipolarity assumed by the neocons as early as 1992 put in place by Clinton starting in 1994. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4391.96s)]
*  And it's been a consistent U.S. policy up until today, basically. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4403.08s)]
*  And Trump is actually, amazingly, it seems, trying to change it, which is unbelievable [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4407.68s)]
*  for us. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4413.84s)]
*  I voted for Biden, of course. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4414.84s)]
*  I was also an adviser to Bernie Sanders. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4416.68s)]
*  I just want to be clear. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4419.16s)]
*  This is a shock to me that it's coming from this side of the American politics. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4420.84s)]
*  The Dems became warmongers. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4426.44s)]
*  Period. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4429.08s)]
*  That certainly also reverberates with your title about the Democrats becoming the party [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4430.92s)]
*  of war. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4436.24s)]
*  The latest news out of Riyadh, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says officials at U.S.-Russia [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4437.24s)]
*  talks agreed to restore embassy staffing, create a high-level team to negotiate peace [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4442.5199999999995s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4447.5199999999995s)]
*  Have you ever come across? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4448.5199999999995s)]
*  Peace. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4449.5199999999995s)]
*  OK, Matt Duss, do you have any answer to this? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4450.5199999999995s)]
*  Most biblical icons depicting Jesus, the Virgin Mary, Abraham or King David with dark skin. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4453.16s)]
*  If not, it's time to look beyond Europe, as Russia has recently unveiled biblical icons [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4460.24s)]
*  featuring darker-skinned figures. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4465.96s)]
*  You might be wondering if Russia has its own unique interpretation of these biblical characters, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4468.76s)]
*  but the truth is quite different. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4473.8s)]
*  These icons represent a factual and untouched reflection of history, as real as the unexplored [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4481.400000000001s)]
*  horizon of time. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4487.4400000000005s)]
*  They are not merely artistic anomalies. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4489.48s)]
*  They hold deep meanings that shed light on hidden truths, sparking profound questions [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4491.879999999999s)]
*  about history, faith representation and the unexpected aspects of religious art. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4496.7s)]
*  Let's delve into the most recognizable figure in the world today. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4503.4s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4506.719999999999s)]
*  Why do you think Africans on Twitter love Russia so much? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4507.719999999999s)]
*  Shit like this is aimed at them? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4509.799999999999s)]
*  Moldova, Mama Liga. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4511.639999999999s)]
*  I think the loyalty or rather the support that people in Africa have for Russia has [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4513.32s)]
*  very little to do with this kind of misinformation. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4522.68s)]
*  I'm sure it's part of it, but has a lot to fucking do with the fact that, you know, they [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4526.8s)]
*  might have had some resentment towards Western powers. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4533.4s)]
*  OK. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4537.4s)]
*  Unless you think China also is doing this kind of thing and they're saying Xi Jinping [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4538.76s)]
*  opened up the world's oldest vault and found out that Jesus was black. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4544.0s)]
*  I just, I think a lot of people living in the global south just fucking despise Western [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4549.12s)]
*  superpowers. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4556.12s)]
*  I don't know for some reason. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4557.320000000001s)]
*  And they probably look at Russia as like the only country that's fighting back. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4559.68s)]
*  Now are they correct? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4565.04s)]
*  No, I don't think they're correct for this assessment. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4566.04s)]
*  OK, I'm just explaining to you what their assessment is. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4568.5199999999995s)]
*  OK, do you see what I'm saying? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4572.719999999999s)]
*  As stated in Mark 422, for there is nothing hidden which shall not be manifested, neither [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4575.24s)]
*  anything kept secret that would not be brought to light for centuries. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4581.44s)]
*  The prevalent image of Jesus Christ, particularly in Western cultures, has portrayed him as [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4586.12s)]
*  a fair skin with long wavy light brown or blonde hair, often depicted with blue eyes. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4592.04s)]
*  However, the Bible provides limited descriptions of Jesus' physical appearance. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4597.92s)]
*  Most of our knowledge about Jesus comes from the first four books of the New Testament, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4603.16s)]
*  Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4608.16s)]
*  According to the Gospels, Jesus was a Jewish man born in Bethlehem and raised... [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4612.0s)]
*  This is 20 minutes long. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4617.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4619.24s)]
*  Oh, wait, let's watch this part. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4621.5199999999995s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4623.08s)]
*  Moscow Cathedral. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4623.839999999999s)]
*  This arises a debate. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4625.28s)]
*  Society and the... [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4627.0s)]
*  A sparked widespread conversations and a sense of wonderment surrounding this subject. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4628.52s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to move one of Russia's holiest icons from [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4634.04s)]
*  a museum to a Moscow cathedral. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4638.96s)]
*  This arises a debate around Putin's growing reliance on the church. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4641.2s)]
*  Emphasizing on the importance of the holy icon, Putin ordered Andrei Rublev's trinity [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4645.16s)]
*  be transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church from Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery for a year. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4650.4800000000005s)]
*  The relocation of Russia's most well-known icon highlights how closely the war has intertwined [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4657.2s)]
*  politics and religion. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4663.24s)]
*  The icon depicts the Ork of Mamre where the three angels visited Abraham in the Book of Genesis. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4666.24s)]
*  Have you observed a remarkable aspect about the icons showcased here? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4672.72s)]
*  They are all predominantly black in colour. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4677.44s)]
*  These icons, originating from the 14th century, have been gathered from private collections [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4680.2s)]
*  throughout Russia. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4685.8s)]
*  They represent... [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4686.8s)]
*  I love this shit, dude. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4687.8s)]
*  This is a 20 minute AI video. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4691.320000000001s)]
*  This is a 20 minute AI video talking about something that just simply did not happen. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4696.68s)]
*  Like Vladimir Putin opens the oldest vault to reveal that Jesus Christ was actually black. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4701.88s)]
*  I fucking love that, dude. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4709.64s)]
*  I mean, this is my shit. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4711.320000000001s)]
*  All right, let's get back to... [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4712.76s)]
*  Let's get back to these liberals now, okay, discussing silly things. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4714.4400000000005s)]
*  They are afraid of discussing the truth that Vladimir Putin opened the world's oldest vault [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4719.56s)]
*  and revealed the truth that Jesus was a black Israelite. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4726.92s)]
*  ...and promote economic cooperation. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4731.16s)]
*  Your thoughts on this and where this history goes from there? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4734.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I read that readout. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4739.88s)]
*  I think it's interesting. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4741.400000000001s)]
*  I would also note that in that one of those points is not just economic cooperation, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4742.2s)]
*  but quote, investment opportunities. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4746.76s)]
*  So again, it really does seem like the Trump administration is not just trying to make peace, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4749.88s)]
*  but trying to talk about potentially dividing the spoils with Russia. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4755.8s)]
*  And that is very concerning, because I don't think that's going to lead to a sustainable and [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4760.12s)]
*  durable peace agreement. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4764.92s)]
*  But again, in basic terms, it's good and fine that the United States and Russia are talking. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4767.0s)]
*  We need to talk to our adversaries more generally. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4772.92s)]
*  I think that's always true. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4775.72s)]
*  But the details will matter. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4778.68s)]
*  And again, Ukraine's buy-in is absolutely necessary for this. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4781.8s)]
*  This is not an agreement that can be made over their heads. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4786.28s)]
*  And I do want to step back and just respond to a couple of things that Professor Sacks [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4789.4800000000005s)]
*  said in the kind of history that he laid out to me, that Ukrainians themselves play little, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4794.44s)]
*  if any, role in the history that Professor Sacks just lays out. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4799.16s)]
*  This idea that 2014 was just a U.S.-backed coup is false. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4803.08s)]
*  Yanukovych was overthrown after one of the largest demonstrations in Ukraine's history, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4808.2s)]
*  known as the Euromaidan. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4814.5199999999995s)]
*  It was not the case that Yanukovych simply wanted to make Ukraine neutral. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4815.719999999999s)]
*  He wanted to draw Ukraine closer to Russia in a way that an overwhelming majority of [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4819.72s)]
*  Ukrainians rejected. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4825.320000000001s)]
*  So we need to understand the history and all its complexity here. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4827.64s)]
*  The Ukrainian people played a major role in that event. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4831.240000000001s)]
*  They played a major role in the decision to resist quite admirable. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4835.160000000001s)]
*  Guys, please stop yelling at Maddus for... [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4840.200000000001s)]
*  No, it's ridiculous. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4844.76s)]
*  Yes, there is a State Department involvement in it, but it doesn't change the reality that [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4846.84s)]
*  Yanukovych was, you know, he was going, he was going closer and closer to the Russian sphere of [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4853.16s)]
*  interest and influence. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4860.68s)]
*  And also simultaneously, people absolutely were angry. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4863.16s)]
*  Like he was not popular, man. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4866.52s)]
*  The fuck? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4871.0s)]
*  How many times does this have to happen globally for you guys to recognize that? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4871.96s)]
*  Like, yes, America takes advantage of real popular sentiment on the ground. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4876.28s)]
*  ...tolerably and courageously, the Russian invasion of their own country. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4880.44s)]
*  Now, going back to the negotiations in March of 2022, I think to treat the talks that took [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4885.32s)]
*  place in Turkey as if they would have simply ended the war again is not accurate. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4890.92s)]
*  Now, there were interesting possibilities in those talks. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4895.96s)]
*  There's little evidence that Putin himself was completely bought in. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4900.599999999999s)]
*  I'm very skeptical that having launched a major invasion a month before, he would have been willing [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4904.04s)]
*  simply to end that invasion. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4908.6s)]
*  But again, this story that Professor Sachs is telling of the United States as the major [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4911.0s)]
*  manipulator and the key problem, and everyone else is simply reacting to what the United States does, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4916.76s)]
*  I think does not really reckon with reality. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4922.68s)]
*  I'm certainly a critic of U.S. foreign policy. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4925.08s)]
*  I'm a strong critic of the Biden administration's foreign policy. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4927.4800000000005s)]
*  But I do think if we want to have a real and honest discussion about where U.S. foreign policy [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4930.68s)]
*  has failed and where it needs to go, we need to reckon with the actual complex history [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4935.64s)]
*  of these events. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4941.320000000001s)]
*  And it's not just a story of unending U.S. villainy. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4942.120000000001s)]
*  And Matt, just briefly, because we're running out of time for this segment, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4947.56s)]
*  the Trump administration has also been pushing for increased military expenditures by the NATO [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4952.360000000001s)]
*  countries from 2 percent. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4959.64s)]
*  Now it wants 5 percent of their GDP in terms of military spending. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4961.4800000000005s)]
*  What's your response? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4966.6s)]
*  Because obviously, the United States, as the main producer of weapons in the world, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4967.96s)]
*  would benefit from such increased military spending by the various countries of Europe. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4971.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4977.4800000000005s)]
*  This is the point that Trump has made repeatedly, and not just Trump. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4977.96s)]
*  And if you remember, Barack Obama was also someone who was pushing NATO member countries [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4981.08s)]
*  to meet their commitments. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4986.44s)]
*  By raising that commitment, it's something very interesting from Trump if he expects that they'll [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4988.12s)]
*  be buying these weapons from the United States. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4992.759999999999s)]
*  But I think one potentially interesting positive consequence of Trump's approach here is that [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=4995.799999999999s)]
*  if it really does force the Europeans to finally, at long last, start taking more serious steps to [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5003.0s)]
*  see to their own security. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5009.0s)]
*  I mean, some of the comments that were played earlier from Keir Stammer, I'm not so sure [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5010.599999999999s)]
*  about the idea of UK troops patrolling Ukraine, but just the fact. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5013.96s)]
*  Bro, Keir Stammer walked that back at the end of his statement. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5019.08s)]
*  He couldn't even hold on to a security commitment without recognizing that this security commitment [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5023.24s)]
*  is completely and utterly meaningless if America is not on board with it. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5029.24s)]
*  Like, yes, we're going to send troops into Ukraine to defend the Ukraine. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5033.64s)]
*  And if America is not a part of the bargain, then we won't do it because that would be silly. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5040.44s)]
*  But you see European governments now stepping up and looking much with a bit more urgency [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5047.24s)]
*  about their own responsibilities. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5054.2s)]
*  Like, I think is funny to think that Europe in all of this madness and chaos, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5056.36s)]
*  okay, especially with like America being like, yeah, fuck you. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5064.36s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5068.12s)]
*  We do what we want and there's nothing you can say about it. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5069.160000000001s)]
*  Are going to turn around and be like, well, I guess it's time to defend Ukraine. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5072.280000000001s)]
*  Like maybe, maybe, okay. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5077.88s)]
*  I just think it's unlikely. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5081.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5083.8s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5084.360000000001s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not making any fucking, I'm not making any predictions on this issue. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5085.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5090.68s)]
*  It's like, I feel like you got a lot more problems to worry about internally right now [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5091.320000000001s)]
*  in every single one of those countries. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5096.040000000001s)]
*  Especially with the insane growth of fascist politics in every single one of these countries, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5099.4800000000005s)]
*  where are they going to get those weapons from? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5106.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other side of the bargain, which is like, they're still using American [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5107.72s)]
*  weapons to do this. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5111.0s)]
*  So, Hey, we get to make money. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5111.88s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5113.320000000001s)]
*  That was not a prediction that came out of my mouth. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5113.96s)]
*  I would never make a prediction about Russia, Ukraine affairs, except I have for the past [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5116.280000000001s)]
*  three years. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5121.400000000001s)]
*  And it, with the exception of that one that everybody yells about every other thing has [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5122.040000000001s)]
*  basically come to fruition in front of our eyes unfolding. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5126.28s)]
*  And people are still mad at me for some reason in their own neighborhood. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5128.84s)]
*  I do think that could have potential, you know, positive consequences for the United [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5132.84s)]
*  States, given the way that, you know, the U S security architect is something that helps [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5137.0s)]
*  buttress our own military industrial complex and diminishes. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5142.599999999999s)]
*  And I think really corrupts our own democracy. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5145.88s)]
*  So anything that weakens the military industrial, I think one of the funniest arguments I remember [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5149.0s)]
*  at the time was because people were trying to turn this into like a fuck Hassan thing, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5153.56s)]
*  like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5158.4400000000005s)]
*  One of the things that people tried to say in terms of like what kind of material harm [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5160.68s)]
*  I've individually caused was Hassan's Ukrainian fans probably trusted him and didn't evacuate [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5164.84s)]
*  in time and died. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5173.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5175.56s)]
*  My Ukrainian fans were listening to me and trusting me more than they were trusting [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5176.120000000001s)]
*  their own fucking state, which was saying the exact same thing I was saying. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5182.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5186.2s)]
*  They tried to say, I have blood on my hands. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5186.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5188.92s)]
*  No, they were probably listening to, you know, Ukrainian media and also Ukrainian politicians [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5190.36s)]
*  who were also saying the same things that I was saying. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5197.56s)]
*  They always, my haters always make it seem like I'm materializing just like false information [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5200.44s)]
*  and not, and not like, you know, responding to what Ukrainian resources were saying as well. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5206.28s)]
*  Bill complex, I would say is all to the good. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5213.32s)]

*  because black people were in the Bible that the Americans turned white men that they told the [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5273.5599999999995s)]
*  stories to us, but Russians didn't get the memo. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5277.16s)]
*  They went off the real story songs of Solomon. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5278.92s)]
*  And when the stories were conveyed to Americans, they were whitewashed. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5281.88s)]
*  However, Russians seem to have disregarded this alteration and pursued genuine historical accuracy. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doszIDXf7ik&t=5286.280000000001s)]
