# Is Gaza Turning On Hamas? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0)
*  time and time again [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=0.0s)]
*  It has shown that Hamas is [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  More popular in the West Bank in the eyes of the Palestinians in the West Bank [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=5.28s)]
*  Then they are in Gaza there needs to be a reason for that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=8.66s)]
*  part of the reason is because of course people attribute the crimes of Israel in terms of like famine or in terms of the horrible [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=11.96s)]
*  conditions to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=17.88s)]
*  Administrative failures of Hamas [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=20.2s)]
*  All right, let's move on from Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=26.92s)]
*  Let's get into [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=28.92s)]
*  Let's get to Gaza, but this time an issue in Gaza that the mainstream is really excited to cover for once [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  the same mainstream in the Western world that did not cover the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=38.84s)]
*  UN [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=45.96s)]
*  human rights report [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=47.44s)]
*  49 pages [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  detailing with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=51.92s)]
*  Testimonies and direct CCTV footage like direct evidence that Israel has been doing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=54.24s)]
*  To the Palestinians as a weapon of war and also simultaneously trying to the Palestinian population by killing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  By by shutting down hospitals where there are in vitro fertilization centers by by killing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=67.56s)]
*  like newborn children, you know [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=74.12s)]
*  Shutting down the the healthcare infrastructure in per it on purpose [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=78.08s)]
*  None of that gets a lot of coverage in the Western world or when it does is barely like, you know [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=82.2s)]
*  Is it barely a subheader? The lead is buried, you know [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=87.16s)]
*  Israel restarting the ceasefire is covered but obviously under [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=91.84s)]
*  terms where [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=96.88s)]
*  Israel was just forced to do this, you know that sort of thing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=98.72s)]
*  But now that there are now that there are protests happening in Gaza that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=102.72s)]
*  Primarily want to put an end to the bloodshed for understandable reasons. I was like the thing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=109.44s)]
*  that the thing that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=116.32s)]
*  What Israel denies that I say something wrong now that there are protests in Gaza, which? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  Primarily want the bloodshed to stop [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=124.28s)]
*  with [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  definitely [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=128.4s)]
*  Anti Hamas protesters in the protest the media is going. Well, there it is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=130.16s)]
*  the Palestinians have finally had enough of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=137.36s)]
*  Hamas that's who they care the most about they don't care about the bombs. They have the bombs are fine [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=141.28s)]
*  It's Hamas that they care about they think it's Hamas's fault that Israel's bugging them now [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=147.24s)]
*  This is also being egged on by the Israeli command [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=151.84s)]
*  For the record like the Israeli military here. I have it from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Here right here. This is important to understand the protest against Hamas are being ordered by the Israeli military. They're not ordered [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't say they're ordered by the Israeli military. I don't fully agree with the statement from Zionism [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  observer, even though I believe [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=173.08s)]
*  Zionism observer is a is a formative archiver of that. I'm pretty sure international human rights groups are using as well. They [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  primarily focus on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=184.28s)]
*  archiving that Israeli occupying for soldiers themselves [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=186.28s)]
*  Post on the timeline, okay [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=188.64s)]
*  The defense minister costs who so far does not have an ICRS warrant told Palestinians and Gaza [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=192.55999999999997s)]
*  They will lose their homes and more land if they don't join the protest. Here is Emmanuel Mabee Manny Fabian [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=196.92s)]
*  Okay, is the IDF military [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  correspondent for the think times of Israel [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  He says defense minister Israel Cots warns Palestinians and Gaza the military will soon operate in additional areas of the strip telling them to learn [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  from the civilians in Beit Lehi who have been protesting against Hamas [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=216.52s)]
*  Gaza residents the idea will soon operate with the intensity and additional areas in Gaza [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=220.68s)]
*  And you'll be required to evacuate for your protection of the combat zone says in a video statement [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=224.28s)]
*  The plans are the plans are ready and approved Hamas is risking your life and will make you lose your homes and more and more and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=230.12s)]
*  more land [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=236.62s)]
*  That will be added to the Israeli defense array [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=239.08s)]
*  Learn from the residents of Beit Lehi as they did you should also demand the removal of mass from Gaza in the immediate release of all [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=241.5s)]
*  Israeli hostages this the war he adds [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=248.36s)]
*  The protesters in Gaza are quite explicitly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=254.4s)]
*  Conferred into Israel's total seizures creating famine conditions and is in its fourth week for Israeli officials to uplift those protests and not lift [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  The siege is as cynical as it gets [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, the carob is false. I'll go smart with all the same better [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=265.72s)]
*  Also, this is in Hebrew and not Arabic what resident of Gaza is you know? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean there are some residents of Gaza. They speak Hebrew, but understand that if Israel is speaking in Arabic [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=277.12s)]
*  They're doing propaganda for the Arab population [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=282.68s)]
*  It's usually with an intent to humiliate them if they're speaking in Hebrew [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=285.32000000000005s)]
*  They're doing propaganda for the Israeli population with an intent to humiliate the Palestinians and then you know [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=289.48s)]
*  Demonstrate a strong show of force and if they're speaking in English, it is the most woke shit you've ever heard [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=295.72s)]
*  It's the most like it is the most like I'm gonna take the genocide that we're doing and explain it to you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=302.12s)]
*  Like we are the victims. Just remember it was a very basic [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=308.24s)]
*  principle behind [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=311.72s)]
*  Israeli officials [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=313.48s)]
*  Okay [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=315.44s)]
*  so the fact that this is in Hebrew implies that this is not for the Palestinian population at all, but instead is for [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=316.68s)]
*  the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=322.92s)]
*  The Israeli population and this is the statement that I just read out to you. He's just basically saying it [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=324.12s)]
*  Okay. Now, of course, of course [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  the primary purpose of the protests in Gaza are not to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=333.68s)]
*  Unseat Hamas in the way that the media is implying in the Western world [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=338.32s)]
*  It is to stop the siege stop the occupation but beyond that are there people who don't like Hamas in Gaza? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=341.52s)]
*  Of course, there are the fuck do you mean? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=348.24s)]
*  Of course no group of individuals are monolithic [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=350.92s)]
*  I've often talked about the Palestinian sentiment and the reporting coming out of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=354.68s)]
*  dedicated pollsters that go into Gaza and into the West Bank during even this fucking genocide and still actively [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=360.88s)]
*  survey the population and time and time again [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=369.44s)]
*  It has shown that Hamas [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=372.92s)]
*  Is more popular in the West Bank in the eyes of the Palestinians in the West Bank [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=375.8s)]
*  Then they are in Gaza [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=379.92s)]
*  there needs to be a reason for that part of the reason is because of course people attribute the crimes of Israel in terms of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=381.36s)]
*  like famine or in terms of the horrible conditions to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  Administrative failures of Hamas as a political operative as a political entity [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=391.48s)]
*  Part of it is because they also think Hamas is corrupt, right and that's fine. That's a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=396.24s)]
*  Understandable resentment that some Palestinians have most of those Palestinians don't actually talk shit about Hamas regardless [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=401.36s)]
*  Because not because they're afraid that Hamas gonna come and kill them [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=409.16s)]
*  But instead they don't talk shit about Hamas because they understand that the position of Hamas right now is an emancipatory one and the position [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=412.12s)]
*  Of Hamas right now is a defensive posture against Israel that's blowing them up. It's pretty basic stuff [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  Having said that of course as I've mentioned before in 2005 when the last election took place [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  How do you know this not only do I read I also talk to Palestinian people though? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  What's my position? It's very simple. I do not have any loyalty to any party [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=437.48s)]
*  I do not care about who [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  Governs Gaza or the West Bank beyond the Palestinian people themselves. I want Palestinian people to have [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=446.48s)]
*  Autonomy I want Palestinian people to have sovereignty [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=454.04s)]
*  That's what I care about so if there is a major push [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=457.44s)]
*  Okay a [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=462.4s)]
*  major push [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=464.2s)]
*  To to do elections or last elections were in 2006. Sorry. I said 2005 was in 2006 [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  If there's a major push to vote for someone else into a position of power and it certainly is not gonna be Fata [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=472.2s)]
*  Okay, then fine [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  Like that's great very controversial take us on. I know very controversial [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't know why a lot of people have [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=484.32s)]
*  Mistaken [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=488.76s)]
*  Western defenders of Palestine and Palestinians as being writers entirely for Hamas [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=490.48s)]
*  Okay, there is no like it doesn't matter to me Hamas is but a name [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay, it's a name to a [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=504.48s)]
*  Movement that is choosing to militarily resist against the Israeli occupation [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=507.96s)]
*  You can say all these people are pro Hamas across the board [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=513.84s)]
*  But I have no political allegiances beyond the fact that they are the only game in town and they are actively defending [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=517.6s)]
*  Against Israeli incursions in the Gaza Strip. That's it. It's that simple [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=526.32s)]
*  Just like if the Palestinians came together and had a free and fair election in a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=537.72s)]
*  Future in a positive future that seems so far away right now and they all universally voted for Hamas [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna sit here and be like [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=547.2s)]
*  That's up. That's it. So there it is Muhammad Shahada getting many questions about the demonstration of Gaza [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=549.64s)]
*  So here's my full assessment of the protest their potential and limitations [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=555.24s)]
*  genuineness and spontaneity versus outside influence motives and goals and their ability to actually challenge Hamas or [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  Bring the war close to an end the protests seem to have started spontaneously in small numbers in unlimited areas [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=563.44s)]
*  Their grievances are unique people are tired desperate for the genocide than at any cost [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=569.28s)]
*  many want Hamas to step down from government to take away Israel's pretext for the siege and killing but [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=573.08s)]
*  the protest quickly drew the interest and influence of external actors keen to exploit gossips despair and pain and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=577.82s)]
*  This may end up undermining the movement instead of helping EG Israel demanding gossips take to the street or face death [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=582.92s)]
*  Land theft and forever war will backfire. That's what Israel caught said F Hamas the no, dude [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  That's not how this works if [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=594.4s)]
*  Every single Palestinian once the occupation is lifted is like we want to vote for Hamas [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=596.76s)]
*  That's not up to me. Okay, and that's not up to you either. It is [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=602.92s)]
*  unironically [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  Western chauvinism for you to think like no you don't understand like that's really up like that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=609.24s)]
*  Hamas gets in he gets he gets the way what? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=614.8s)]
*  Dude, you are a through and through okay. There is no world in which [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=617.84s)]
*  There's no world in which like [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=623.9599999999999s)]
*  You can entertain this attitude [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=626.28s)]
*  Okay, this attitude is saying 9-eleven was awesome. It's no different. You want to say that to my face? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes, I would I'd spit on your face you little cowardly baboon get the idea you want to see those my page your internet warrior [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=633.84s)]

*  You are lower than the shit. I stepped in this morning. Okay. Oh [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  You want to say that to my face dude, I'll show you I'll show you my compilation [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=651.64s)]
*  Little bitch anyway biggest loser of all time at least I put my face out there and my name out there [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=657.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? You're anonymously chirping. Oh, you wouldn't seen that to my face [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=662.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm actually six foot eight 350 pounds. Okay, I'm shredded to you up. I have a black belt anyway [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=668.0s)]
*  When Israel suddenly blesses Palestinians rights to expression against Hamas while detaining maiming and murdering those who exercising the same right against the occupation [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=676.44s)]
*  It discourages people from taking part in the protest lest they be called Israel's collaborators [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=683.2s)]
*  An apparent father influences detectable in some of today's protest with the chant yashia being added [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=688.08s)]
*  This chant accusing Hamas of being Iranian stooges was popular in 2007 amongst fought out partisans during the photo Hamas conflict [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=692.76s)]
*  That saw the latter take over Gaza [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're saying Hamas or Shia because Iran offers material support to Hamas [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=703.08s)]
*  Israeli media identify one of the protests today as someone whose family affiliated with Muhammad Dawlan's Fata [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=709.1600000000001s)]
*  Similarly a father influence on the demonstrations will make it easier for Hamas to dismiss slash de legitimize them as pushed by an external agenda [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=714.5200000000001s)]
*  so Israel actually pushing in favor of these protests and [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=721.08s)]
*  And saying like you'll get if you don't take to the streets and demand that Hamas gets [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=725.12s)]
*  Cast aside is unironically going to cause people to not protest against Hamas. So that's the inherent irony here [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  That's it. That's the that is the the issue that a lot of people are [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=738.08s)]
*  Not recognizing but the who these are Shia or am I wrong? Yes, they are. They are also backed by Iran and [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=744.92s)]
*  Palestinians seemingly love those guys. So I don't think that there is a real sectarian [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=752.0s)]
*  Attitude here. They don't give a shit for them. It's like we're getting dominated by Israel [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=758.12s)]
*  We're getting murdered by Israel anyone that stops. This is good. Anyone that stops is my ally [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  Because that is the highest order of priority [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=769.76s)]
*  now what's ironic about these protests also is that like the and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  This is something that a lot of people failed to recognize with October 7 people attribute October 7 to Hamas and in large part [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=777.76s)]
*  It was the Hamas militant wing that [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=785.3s)]
*  Participated in the in the militancy participated in the kidnapping having said that however [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=788.2199999999999s)]
*  In spite of their much smaller sizes and much smaller [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=793.54s)]
*  influence every other facet of Palestinian political groups also participated in October 7 in a united front [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=798.9s)]
*  October 7 wasn't just conducted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  October 7 was actually conducted by Hamas Islamic Jihad the popular front for the liberation of Palestine the Democratic Front for the liberation of Palestine and [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=810.9799999999999s)]
*  numerous other even smaller formations [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=820.0999999999999s)]
*  There were fatah members that were also involved on October 7. So the idea that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=822.8199999999999s)]
*  HTS Andy calm down what? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=830.78s)]
*  HTS Andy's calm down the idea that like [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=833.42s)]
*  That this is just Hamat Hamas itself also has [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=837.18s)]
*  Maintained two positions that I think are quite significant [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=843.5s)]
*  Okay position number one position number one the release of political leaders including more popular political leaders [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=847.42s)]
*  Than anyone Hamas has ever been able to produce from Israeli prisons political leaders who are directly at odds with Hamas [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=854.78s)]
*  Okay, both an ideology but political leaders nonetheless that are interested in the end to the occupation [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=862.5400000000001s)]
*  The second point that is very important is that Hamas has also said that they would disarm and dissolve [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=868.5s)]
*  their [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=875.34s)]
*  political apparatus if [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=876.7s)]
*  Israel ended its occupation tomorrow [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=879.26s)]
*  So it's not like these guys are saying [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=882.82s)]
*  We're fucking no we're staying here steadfast no matter what happens [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=885.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay, he caught misleading his audience about calling you a terrorist supporter [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=891.0600000000001s)]
*  Ethan Klein is correct that Noah's names and cut a statement about Hassan Parker short, but so did Ethan the full quote is now [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=895.98s)]
*  I'm gonna sit here and tell you that Hassan loves all terrorists [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=900.48s)]
*  But what I will say is that there isn't many he don't like now. I'm gonna sit here and tell you that Hassan [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=902.5400000000001s)]
*  What I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that Hassan loves all terrorists, but what I will say is that there isn't many he don't like [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=907.94s)]
*  Okay. Well, that's the derail and I don't really care about that because I'm talking about something more important right now [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=914.7s)]
*  I'm talking about the fucking news [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=920.1800000000001s)]
*  As I was stating as I was stating [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=923.94s)]
*  The very fact that Hamas has also maintained the position that they would disband [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=928.02s)]
*  As long as there was as long as there was no [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=934.74s)]
*  As long as there was no more occupation [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=939.86s)]
*  can be seen as like a veiled like a [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=943.02s)]
*  What's the term for it like a gamble because they know that Israel will never stop right you can say that but the reality is [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=946.72s)]
*  They've put it out there [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=953.0s)]
*  They've put it out there and Israel has every opportunity to see it through if they chose to see it through if they wanted to [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=955.0s)]
*  They could just go back to fucking bombing Gaza. You know, no one's stopping them. So a bluff. Thank you. Yeah [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=961.64s)]
*  Israel could call their bluff and yet they have chosen not to do that [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=968.08s)]
*  That's also something to consider here the protest messages are simple uncontroversial and realistic [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=973.24s)]
*  We want to live and the war genocide won a peace in normal life [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=979.72s)]
*  Hamas must step down from government some sent reassuring messages like we're not against Hamas, but it's rule but against this rule [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=982.12s)]
*  However actors trying to exploit these protests to escalate the messaging to the next level eg demanding disarmament fully dismantling Hamas [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=988.92s)]
*  Foreign government in Gaza whitewashing Israel framing Hamas is a sole problem are undermining the potential of these demonstrations [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=995.08s)]
*  Many Gazans want Hamas to step down from government even inside Hamas itself [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1002.36s)]
*  Many want a permanent ceasefire, but full disarmament is a very sensitive topic [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1005.88s)]
*  The mere existence of any form of weapons in Gaza is seen by many as a deterrent against the idea of staying in Gaza forever [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1009.88s)]
*  Why the fuck would you put down your arms if Israel does not fully withdraw their troops? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1016.6s)]
*  You cannot have sovereignty [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1023.8s)]
*  Especially when you're sitting in the ass cheeks of an apartheid state that stole your land from the jump [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1026.1200000000001s)]
*  Without fucking having a standing military full disarmament just makes it so that the Nakba is [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1031.52s)]
*  Conducted over and over again and many is this is the knock but is being conducted [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1038.08s)]
*  Full disarmament also looks a lot like the West Bank and not the parts like I'm not talking about til karma [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1042.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm not talking about Janine but parts of the West Bank that Israel currently occupies and dominates [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1047.8s)]
*  That's what it fucking looks like. Okay, if you want to know what it looks like [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
*  For the day-to-day existence of Palestinians being dominated under the cruel rule of the Israeli apartheid look no further than the West Bank [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1057.72s)]
*  Where they as recently as this past week actually? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1065.6s)]
*  allowed right-wing settlers to go and engage in a lynch mob against [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1070.64s)]
*  I [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1077.08s)]
*  Guess hum Dumball all who was literally sitting right here only a couple weeks prior to that and then went on to win an Oscar [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1078.32s)]
*  For the documentary that co-directed called no other land the IDF turned around and arrested him. They detained him [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1086.36s)]
*  They kidnapped him. It's fucking insane [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1092.7199999999998s)]
*  The protest demands and the war Hamas stepped down from government have largely been have been largely accepted by Hamas who has been calling for a permanent [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1096.1999999999998s)]
*  end of the war and accepted seating governance to a technocratic PA gov or an independent administrative committee [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1102.84s)]
*  Israel says no to both even if Hamas toppled is top of these governments Israel's unlikely to accept an alternative form of Palestinian governance [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1107.8799999999999s)]
*  And IDF withdrawal from Gaza or an end to the war [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1115.36s)]
*  Netanyahu maintains a veto on all of the above and depopulating Gaza remains Israel's priority [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1118.6s)]
*  the more Israel talks about emptying out Gaza the lesser those protests and potential and more strength Hamas will draw by portraying itself as the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1124.76s)]
*  only entity that can prevent or at least [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1131.3999999999999s)]
*  Challenge this scenario and make the IDF stay in Gaza costly add to this the continuation of Israeli attacks [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1133.6799999999998s)]
*  Probably be the biggest factor in limiting the expansion of these demonstrations [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1140.2s)]
*  Israeli mouthpieces called on Gazans to demonstrate in certain areas that were then bombed by the IDF [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1143.96s)]
*  The genocide creates a rallying around the flag effect that strengthens Hamas's survival [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1149.48s)]
*  What Israel failed to accomplish in 16 months of total war it won't succeed to get by demanding starved and desperate Gazans march to its [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1154.3200000000002s)]
*  tune [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1162.16s)]
*  Popular demonstrations usually succeed by disrupting life shutting down the economy making it possible for the government to function as leaders to move around [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1162.8000000000002s)]
*  Israel did all of this and more already. There's nothing left protesters [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1169.64s)]
*  Can do to pressure Hamas amid genocide ultimately a true popular reckoning with Hamas can only happen once there is a ceasefire at the ballot [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1173.16s)]
*  Boxes nonetheless the protests are a natural right to Gazans who have been through hell on their own for 60 months [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8zudka2b0&t=1180.4s)]
