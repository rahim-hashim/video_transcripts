# Battleground Blitz In The Race For The White House | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w)
*  Out West campaigning in Las Vegas, Trump doubling down on immigration saying he will start mass. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=0.0s)]
*  No, she literally straight up. She straight up was like, oh no, you don't understand. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=5.0s)]
*  I'm different than I'm a new generational Democrat. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=9.9s)]
*  And it's very frustrating for me seeing this happen, trying to point to history, trying to explain to people [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=18.6s)]
*  that the Democratic Party is not only up the immediate bag in front of their eyes in terms of like winning the election, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=27.5s)]
*  but the Democratic Party is also obviously with this kind of capitulation to right wing framing on issues, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=34.9s)]
*  especially as it pertains to immigration, are not only hurting their chances electorally, but they're also hurting the country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=41.4s)]
*  OK, they are causing irreparable damage by not actively counter messaging against this kind of. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  And here you have it. You got Haitian migrant stories running rampant. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=54.9s)]
*  OK, that's precisely the reason why the libtards that come into this goddamn community don't screech at me about mass deportations. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=59.1s)]
*  Why don't they screech at me about mass deportations? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=67.8s)]
*  You might wonder, oh, Trump wins. There's going to be mass deportations. You want Trump to win? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=70.4s)]
*  They don't say that. Why? Because the Democratic Party's official policy on it is, yeah, Trump wants to do mass deportation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=74.7s)]
*  Let's not talk about that. We want to do the best deportations, actually. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=82.1s)]
*  We want to do the best, strongest border policy. We're outflanking Trump on the border policy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=84.7s)]
*  We want the deportations too, actually. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=90.3s)]
*  That's why the libtards don't come in here and talk about deportations all of a sudden, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=93.0s)]
*  because now they're pro deportations because they're bots. They're NPCs. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, have just over 50 days to go until Election Day in the sprint to November 5th. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  It is on Vice President Kamala Harris and former president. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  Nigel Farage has a higher net approval rating than Keir Starmer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=111.7s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. We're so cooked. Oh my God. Oh my God. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=119.4s)]
*  Globally, we're cooked. It's happening faster than I thought it was going to. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=125.2s)]
*  Okay, it is happening faster than I thought it was going to happen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=131.1s)]
*  That is crazy. The number the guy here, Nigel Farage, just did a pogrom. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=137.6s)]
*  Okay, a pogrom. They did an Islamophobic, like mass lynching campaign in the UK, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=144.2s)]
*  like a month ago. Okay, one singular month ago, he did an anti-Muslim pogrom. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  That's crazy. Wow. Wow. Good stuff. Good stuff. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=159.6s)]
*  Two polling things if you want to touch on them here are all the post debate national polls. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=165.5s)]
*  You go plus DFP found Harris over Trump on the economy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=169.9s)]
*  The YouGov Yahoo poll found Harris beat Trump on every issue except immigration, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=174.8s)]
*  including the all-important cost of living 45 to 39 Harris post debate polls. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=177.9s)]
*  Happy Saturday. Yeah, all the polls showing plus five plus four. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=183.0s)]
*  That's why I said the she's going to see at least a minimum plus two bump [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=187.3s)]
*  the one poll that they showed on CNN was probably too early to tell when we were looking at the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=193.5s)]
*  Harry Enton coverage on it because she was like she she definitely is going to get a bump from this debate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=199.0s)]
*  I mean she clobbered Trump and yeah, so she did question is is it enough? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=206.2s)]
*  You know, maybe probably this is why I still have not run on the Donald Trump is going to win [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=211.9s)]
*  attitude overall. I keep telling you don't worry liberals, you know, your joyful campaign will probably inevitably [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=219.4s)]
*  yield a Democratic Party victory because of the overarching dissatisfaction that people have with Donald Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=226.4s)]
*  It just shouldn't be a race to the bottom. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=232.8s)]
*  It shouldn't be a race a mirror race of like who can be the worst and still eat out a marginal victory. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=235.0s)]
*  Why hasn't Walls are here is publicly denounced the neo-Nazi laws about Haitian seems like a no-brainer [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=241.3s)]
*  because they are completely locked in on it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=245.7s)]
*  Okay, they already tied themselves to this issue. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=249.5s)]
*  They already tied themselves on the right-wing framing when Joe Biden on October 5 two days before October 7 came out [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  and said we wrote a right-wing border bill and we are going to push it and we are going to get Donald Trump to you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  know, say no to it because he cares about that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=271.3s)]
*  He wants to use this as an issue to make himself, you know, win the election or whatever like whatever they were doing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=274.2s)]
*  Then I told you this was the thing that they could have done and they did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=280.3s)]
*  I'm sure I have coverage over here specifically on this issue. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  Let's see. I extensively extensively talked about this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  Let me see if I can find it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=294.5s)]
*  It was before I mean it was much much longer than did a song blast off. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=296.0s)]
*  I did most lives. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=301.3s)]
*  I know our age are going from Dem to Green Party are now voting at all over 1.2 million Haitian Americans [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=302.2s)]
*  decades of Haitian migrants coming in and pet eating and cannibalism is in the UK's economy problems because of right-wing policies [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=306.6s)]
*  or is the downfall of public service? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=311.5s)]
*  Yeah, it is right-wing policies that created the downfall of public services. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=313.0s)]
*  I want to find an older YouTube video of mine if we can find it from like when they first announced this right-wing border bill [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=317.8s)]
*  or at least the tweet because I tweeted about it back then. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=325.1s)]
*  I want to do a I told you so moment here for for a second. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=327.8s)]
*  Okay, they should have used Trump's rejection of the right-wing border bill to go. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  We gave him a chance. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  Now we're moving forward a more empathetic immigration reform. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  No, they should have never pushed for that to begin with. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=338.70000000000005s)]
*  Okay, they should have never pushed for that to begin with. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=341.3s)]
*  Does anyone have a tweet of me back when like they first announced this they first announced the proposal. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=345.1s)]
*  I mean, that's like, oh yeah, here it is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=352.6s)]
*  This is like literally the day of when Biden in the Democratic Party capitulate the right-wing framing on issues. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=354.8s)]
*  They lend the reactionary propaganda credence. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=360.3s)]
*  The only issue with immigration is not letting people enter legally and offering them tools to integrate and work. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=362.7s)]
*  There is no lump sum of late lump sum of labor undocumented immigrants are responsible for less per capita than US citizens. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=367.7s)]
*  Their utilization of the welfare state is marginal and they pay taxes drugs don't come through the openings in the border on Abuela's lap. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  Their traffic through ports inside of American cars. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=384.8s)]
*  Look at that October 6th. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=386.2s)]
*  This was one day before October 7th. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=388.6s)]
*  This is when he launched the border bill breaking President Biden and Axe Trump's white nativist immigration policy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=390.3s)]
*  He ran against only four years ago on Capitol Hill Senate leaders from both parties say they're backing a breakthrough plan and control immigration at the southern border. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, it's part of a broader national security bill that took months to work out. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=405.7s)]
*  But it's strongly opposed by many House Republicans and even some Democrats. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=409.6s)]
*  Nicole has more on that deal, bro. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  This is giving like the exact same energy as when the Barack Obama administration tried to capitulate to the Republican Party and do bipartisanship and cut Social Security spending and then the Freedom Caucus nuked it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  It's the exact same situation being played out in front of our eyes where like the Democrat the grand bargain famously exactly the Democratic Party, which by the way, Joe Biden was also leading that charge last time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=427.70000000000005s)]
*  The Democratic Party keeps conceding and compete Democrats love pushing bad policy and bad politics. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=439.3s)]
*  All this bill does is normalize the normalize the white nativist position that immigration is actually a matter of national security. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=444.5s)]
*  Republicans are always going to be able to outrace is the Dems warning signs from warning signs warning signs. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=450.59999999999997s)]
*  I'll have a better chance of being struck video from October 8th 621 for the border. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=459.4s)]
*  Attic reversal in the battle over the southern border. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=464.1s)]
*  The Biden administration is pushing through a plan to add to a border wall in southern Texas due to a surge in illegal crossings. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=466.70000000000005s)]
*  The White House is waving more than two dozen federal laws to do so. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=472.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, the White House is pushing back on the idea that this building of 17 miles of border wall in South Texas is being done because of pressure from even Republicans and even members. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=475.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this will definitely work. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=486.8s)]
*  I think we should always concede to like insane made up problems that Republicans claim are destroying America. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=488.0s)]
*  That's the best way to go about it, especially after you campaign on the wall being. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=494.7s)]
*  I think that's the best thing to do always make concessions to your enemy who owns a particular talking point, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=497.9s)]
*  especially when when you do that as a Democrat, all you're doing is basically conceding that this is a problem and it's one that only they can solve. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=504.7s)]
*  So there is no better way to duke it out than to capitulate to your enemy. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=512.7s)]
*  It's always something that happens in American politics. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=518.0s)]
*  It's weak. You're basically conceding that there is a major problem when there isn't one. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=521.7s)]
*  And when you do that, one side is the masters at solving that problem. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=527.9000000000001s)]
*  You yourself are always going to be seen as someone who doesn't really have it in their heart to fix it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=533.5s)]
*  One of the greatest examples of this exact story is when the majority of Democrats got together and voted without anyone asking on a messaging bill that said socialism, including Rokana. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=539.5s)]
*  Why would you do that? Are you that stupid? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=553.5s)]
*  To the Republican, to the average Republican, they see you voting on that and think, wow, classic how these socialists are that they are voting against socialism. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=556.2s)]
*  It must be because they're stupid that they voted on socialism bad, literally called denouncing the horrors of socialism. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=566.5s)]
*  There's nothing funnier to me than being a Democrat and voting to pass a messaging bill, a resolution denouncing socialism, the horrors of socialism. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=573.2s)]
*  The resolution overwhelmingly cleared the chamber in a 328 86 to 14 vote. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=583.7s)]
*  The majority of Democrats, 109 of them voted with all the Republicans for the resolution while 86 voted against it and 14. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=589.1s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=596.1s)]
*  This is the difference between me and charlatans who simply change their attitude and their commentary on the whims of the Democratic Party. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=597.9s)]
*  The reason why they get wrong and their fans will come in and say, what's up, Grifter? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=612.2s)]
*  The reason why they consistently find themselves wrong and also on the wrong side of issues. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=618.2s)]
*  And the reason why I'm always right is because I made up my mind by looking at the empirical evidence. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=625.5s)]
*  I made up my mind and have a coherent worldview. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=632.4s)]
*  I have a moral compass that guides my political framework. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=637.0s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=642.0s)]

*  Capucinia and the right-wing framing is that Donald Trump is getting way, way, way out of control. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=725.5s)]
*  The problem is they're not actually going see that's crazy. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=732.6s)]
*  He's saying crazy. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=735.3s)]
*  If they were to at the very least turn around and be like, look at how crazy this guy is. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=736.1s)]
*  Look how weird this guy is. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=739.6s)]

*  That's interesting. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=750.5s)]

*  God, my favorite streamer strikes again. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=753.3s)]

*  I mean, I have been using that quite a bit. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=758.8s)]
*  It's hitlarion rhetoric USA Today columnist Rex Hupka wrote on social media in response to Trump's statement. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=761.9s)]
*  I mean, I didn't invent it, but I have been using it quite a bit. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  Look back in 2021 March 15 2021 border crisis completely manufactured. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  There has always been a crisis under every admin, but the media is portraying this from an incredibly reactionary point of view. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=777.1s)]
*  The crisis in and of itself is actually the inhumanity and the mistreatment of people crossing the border. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=782.4000000000001s)]
*  That's the real crisis. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=789.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay, it is a humanitarian crisis. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=791.1s)]
*  It's not a crisis where they are, you know, invading the country. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=794.1s)]
*  You used the word about this story, this story specifically a lot too. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=798.4s)]
*  Yes, Trump still wins easily due to your electoral college sad for you lot. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=801.3s)]
*  No, these couldn't find a single Democrat who was busing migrants over the border into liberal cities. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=805.1999999999999s)]
*  So they just started doing it themselves. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=809.5s)]
*  It's exactly the same meme as Steven Crowder crossdressing pure projection. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  Like there were so many opportunities for the Democratic Party to like launch a counter initiative against people. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=815.1s)]
*  Just, you know, basically human trafficking a ton of migrants into other states deliberately to use them as pawns in their political strategies or human beings. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=823.0s)]
*  And they didn't do a single thing about it for years. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=833.2s)]
*  And I've been calling this out since the first couple of days of the Biden administration when we saw Biden's border guards whipping Haitian migrants on horseback. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=837.9s)]
*  Okay, I told you this was going to be a massive problem. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=851.1s)]
*  Very, very, very frustrating. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=855.1s)]
*  Yes, I blasted off already. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=856.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=858.3000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, here, let's take a look at the race as it stands now. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=858.9s)]
*  And Donald Trump are hitting the campaign trail in critical swing states. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=861.9s)]
*  The race is still very, very tight. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=865.6s)]
*  ABC's Mary Alice Parks joins us live now from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=867.8000000000001s)]
*  Mary Alice, good morning. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=871.7s)]
*  Yeah, Gio. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=872.9s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=873.4s)]
*  This is a pretty small town only about 44,000 people. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=874.1s)]
*  It's a county where former President Trump won twice. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=877.1s)]
*  But Harris had a rather large energetic crowd last night with several thousand. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=880.2s)]
*  She seemed to tailor her pitch. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=884.4000000000001s)]
*  She talked more about being a prosecutor, about specifically going after Mexican cartels, about wanting to create jobs for people that don't have a college degree. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=885.7s)]
*  All of it seemed to be an attempt to try to chip away at Trump's support here. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  Good evening, Pennsylvania. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=897.6s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris overnight campaigning in central Pennsylvania in a county former President Trump won twice, hoping to chip away at his support. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=900.6s)]
*  We need a president of the United States who works for all the American people and that just stops with all the trying to divide us. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=908.4s)]
*  Like, people are exhausted with that stuff. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=918.1999999999999s)]
*  Anchor Brian Taft from our Philadelphia station, WPVI, sitting down with Harris for her first interview since debating Trump. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=920.8s)]
*  I think some people have a question, given maybe your current role as vice president of the United States. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=927.5s)]
*  How different you are from Joe Biden? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=933.0s)]
*  Well, I'm obviously not Joe Biden. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=936.0s)]
*  And, you know, I offer a new generation of leadership. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=938.0s)]
*  And so, for example, thinking about developing and creating an opportunity economy where it's about investing in areas that really need a lot of work. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=942.5s)]
*  Out West campaigning in Las Vegas, Trump doubling down on immigration, saying he will start mass. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=954.9s)]
*  No, she literally straight up. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=959.6999999999999s)]
*  She straight up was like, oh, no, you don't understand. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=961.9s)]
*  I'm different than I'm a new generational Democrat, different than Joe Biden, which is why I'm going to do exactly the same policies as Joe Biden. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=964.6s)]
*  Like some of the good ones as well. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=975.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=976.9s)]
*  And then also, I'm going to add my own. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=977.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to add my own stupid proposal to it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=980.4s)]
*  Like what you think Joe Biden doesn't care about small businesses? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=983.5s)]
*  Like, what is this argument? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=986.4s)]
*  Like, oh, man, I'm going to be so different than Joe Biden. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=987.6s)]
*  I'm different than Joe Biden, except not at all. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=990.2s)]
*  It's 2019 border talk tweet talking about Biden and the Dems. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=992.5s)]
*  Wait, Biden is not in favor of border crossings. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=995.3s)]
*  This entire video is about supporting Biden. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=997.3s)]
*  Law. Who was I responding to on HBO? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=999.2s)]
*  Bill Marfret's all the Democrats have to do is win is to come off less crazy than Trump. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1002.1s)]
*  And of course, they're blowing it coming across as unserious people who are going to take away all your money. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1006.1s)]
*  So migrants from Honduras can go to college for free. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1009.9s)]
*  Well, yeah, to beat Trump, which is allowed to be 30% race is not 100% shake in my head. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1012.3s)]
*  Josh Murbets. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1016.4s)]
*  I mean, he just he didn't block me. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1017.9s)]
*  I think he's just protected the protected account. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1019.5s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, vindicated again. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1022.5s)]
*  Of course, dude, of course, I'm vindicated. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1026.0s)]
*  It's not even a vindication, though. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1029.3s)]
*  The problem is the problem is like I knew this was coming and I've been screaming about it for months and months and months and months and months. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1031.0s)]
*  I've been screaming about it for years on so many instances on so many instances. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1041.0s)]
*  I was like, you guys are being stupid for this. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1046.0s)]
*  Okay, for years is not even months. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1048.9s)]
*  And the worst part about it is it's not like this was shocking. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1051.8s)]
*  Like what you think the Democrats you think the Republicans are not going to pull the immigration lever to try and win the election. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1057.8s)]
*  Why is there a caravan every two years whenever there's a midterm? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1065.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, there's a caravan of migrants coming in and it's an invasion. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1068.8999999999999s)]
*  Like, are you stupid? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1073.3s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1075.2s)]
*  They keep pulling that lever all the time. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1076.3s)]
*  How the do you not counter? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1078.2s)]
*  How do you not have decent counter messaging against this dumb dude? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1079.6999999999998s)]
*  I hate this. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1083.8s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1085.1s)]
*  It's bad policy. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1085.8s)]
*  It's bad politics. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1086.8999999999999s)]
*  It's just so stupid. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1088.1999999999998s)]
*  And this is absolutely absolutely creating an environment where these guys can let their freak flags fly once again. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1089.8999999999999s)]
*  And if all you care about is like, oh, well, when they show their freak flags, more people will be scared to vote for the Democratic Party. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1099.6s)]
*  You're a bloodless monstrous piece of shit who doesn't care about the inevitable outcome, especially when if the Democrats win and they do push this right-wing border bill, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1105.9s)]
*  then what's the difference between them and Donald Trump? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1115.3000000000002s)]
*  Then you should have just voted for Donald Trump in 2020 because she's pushing Donald Trump's 2020 border proposal. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1117.9s)]
*  Why didn't you vote for Donald Trump then? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1124.7s)]
*  I guess you don't give a fuck about immigrants. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1127.1000000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1129.3000000000002s)]
*  I give a fuck about immigration. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1130.8000000000002s)]
*  I do give a fuck about these issues that I talk about. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1132.0s)]
*  You don't. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1134.4s)]
*  ... deportations specifically in Springfield, Ohio. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1135.2s)]
*  After this week repeating false claims, he made at the debate about Haitian immigrants hurting pets in that town. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1138.5s)]
*  And I'm angry about illegal Haitian migrants. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1144.6000000000001s)]
*  What about legal immigrants? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1147.9s)]
*  You know what's funny about this? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1148.8s)]
*  The Haitian migrants are legal. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1150.1000000000001s)]
*  The difference between a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant is just paperwork. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1152.3s)]
*  Okay? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1156.1000000000001s)]
*  It's simply paperwork. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1156.8s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1158.1000000000001s)]
*  And the Haitian migrants have paperwork. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1158.7s)]
*  They have TPS. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1160.4s)]
*  They're refugees. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1161.5s)]
*  Okay? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1163.1000000000001s)]
*  And so do the Venezuelans. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1163.5s)]
*  They have their paperwork. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1166.6s)]
*  They are literally legally inside of the borders of the United States of America, which is why when they say illegal immigrants, they're actually lying. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1168.0s)]
*  They want them to be illegal. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1175.3s)]
*  Like they want them to be illegalized. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1177.2s)]
*  Okay? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1180.3s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1180.8s)]
*  There's also probably a good reason as to why, and I just can't seem to put my finger on it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1181.5s)]
*  This kind of sentiment never existed about the 187,000 Ukrainian migrants. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1187.6s)]
*  Ukrainian refugees that came into this country and are working alongside the rest of the refugees that are now working inside of the US borders. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1193.1s)]
*  Why is there no argument against them in the similar fashion? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1202.3999999999999s)]
*  Because they're white. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1205.6999999999998s)]
*  Okay? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1206.5s)]
*  And I have no issue with the Ukrainian migrants, obviously. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1207.1s)]
*  This community fundraised so that they could come into the United States. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1209.5s)]
*  Okay? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1213.6s)]
*  There's your monologue from three days ago. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1214.1999999999998s)]
*  People that vote for Republicans don't actually associate the real negative consequences of the legislation that they're signing on for. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1216.1s)]
*  This is a well-documented phenomena. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1224.8999999999999s)]
*  This is something that plagues American politics, and it's something that plagues politics in general. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1229.3s)]
*  People genuinely think, oh, I'm voting for this guy because this, this, this, right? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1235.3999999999999s)]
*  They don't really consider how those policies are going to end up harming themselves. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1240.6s)]
*  A great example of this is obviously on the issue of abortion. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1245.6s)]
*  There are plenty of Republicans that voted for the Republican Party. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1249.3s)]
*  They didn't really care about abortion rights being restricted. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1253.3s)]
*  And now they're like, oh my God, this is actually devastating. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1256.1999999999998s)]
*  What the f***? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1259.8999999999999s)]
*  Because all of a sudden, there's no way you can message out of it. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1261.0s)]
*  Everybody now knows you are responsible for all of the women in places like Texas, in places like Ohio, that can't give topic pregnancies dealt with because Republicans shut that access off. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1264.5s)]
*  They are responsible for it. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1276.9s)]
*  They have to live with that reality. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1278.8s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1281.2s)]
*  Have you reviewed the CNN stuff yet? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1282.3s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1284.3s)]
*  It's on here. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1285.1s)]
*  Speaking of which, it's on the docket somewhere around here. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1287.3s)]
*  It sounds pretty cool, dude, even if you don't know. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1290.3s)]
*  It sounds pretty cool, dude, when you don't have someone on Twitter telling you he's an evil person. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1292.9s)]
*  That's a good tweet. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1296.5s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1298.7s)]

*  This short doco that he did. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1314.0s)]
*  This is another slot from CNN where he's promoting it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1316.9s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1321.4s)]
*  What is it about some of these guys that has made them go from far left to far right? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1322.5s)]
*  Like every young man in a certain point of their lives have like had some kind of insecurity, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1327.9s)]
*  whether it be about their sexuality or whether it be about like their future prospects or whatever. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1333.2s)]
*  And I think that like a lot of these guys take advantage of that and present this false narrative that like in order to be a man, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1337.4s)]
*  you got to be like homophobic. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1345.7s)]
*  It's like no, a real man is going to want to protect people who are marginalized. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1347.0s)]
*  All right, Donnie O'Sullivan with us now. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1352.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1355.6s)]

*  Like wow, this dude who's bralic as hell with the sleeves busted off talking about talking about true masculinity. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1364.1s)]

*  Who you heard from there. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1373.4s)]
*  His name is Hassan Piker. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1374.3s)]
*  He is on Twitch, which is a video game streaming platform. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1376.0s)]
*  He's got about three million followers. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1380.2s)]

*  He's got about three million followers there. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1386.1s)]
*  And look, this is a whole new world of where young people and really people of all ages are getting their information and misinformation. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1389.1s)]
*  So on video game platforms like Twitch, people are also discussing politics. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1397.6s)]
*  They talk about politics all day. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1402.8s)]
*  They discuss politics. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1404.4s)]
*  And some of the men we met on this journey for misinformation for the whole story with Anderson Cooper were guys who spend most of their time online many hours a day. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1406.0s)]
*  They feel disillusioned. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1417.4s)]
*  They feel left behind by politics. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1418.6000000000001s)]
*  They were formerly Bernie Bros. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1421.3000000000002s)]
*  Just up until even for as recently as four years ago. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1422.8000000000002s)]
*  They see not they don't see a material change in their life. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1427.1000000000001s)]
*  They are getting more frustrated as they stay online. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1430.7s)]
*  And they have moved all the way to the to MAGA. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1433.5s)]
*  But even beyond that to the very, very, very far right and into really hateful and extremist spaces online. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1436.1s)]
*  I met two of them. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhQG0j-Vi9w&t=1443.0s)]
