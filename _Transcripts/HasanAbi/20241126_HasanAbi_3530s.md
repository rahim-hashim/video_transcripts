# Top Harris Staff Reveal The Truth About 2024 Loss | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns)
*  Kamala Harris internal numbers also never showed that she was beating Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a bit of a shocker for the record. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=5.4s)]
*  This is actually a shocker. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=7.68s)]
*  Harris campaign aid saying that internal polling never had heard of Trump is a shocker. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=9.5s)]
*  Why is it a shocker? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=13.58s)]
*  Because they didn't even change their campaign strategy and they acted like they were [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=15.02s)]
*  throwing up LeBron numbers, dude. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=20.76s)]
*  I don't know how contenty it is, but positive American interview, the people responsible, the Kamala Harris, and it's apparently maddening. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=22.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=34.72s)]
*  Welcome to pod save America. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=35.06s)]
*  I'm Dan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=36.28s)]
*  Fine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=36.62s)]
*  By the way, speaking of which I will be fucking hosting pod save America tomorrow. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=36.76s)]
*  So it's actually good to see this conversation take place. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=41.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=46.099999999999994s)]
*  I forgot to mention that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=46.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=48.76s)]
*  A lot is going on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=48.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=50.16s)]
*  A lot is going on on the Hassan Abiy universe. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=50.7s)]
*  And I just often forget Mark Warner, one of the bands theme for being too anti-Semitic. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=52.84s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=58.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=59.36s)]
*  In person, huh? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=59.58s)]
*  Save America tomorrow. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=60.44s)]
*  I listened to it this morning and they get progressively angrier. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=61.88s)]
*  We have a special show for you today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=65.48s)]
*  I am here in Washington, DC where I'm about to sit down. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=67.16s)]
*  The main, the main show chat. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=69.88s)]
*  I'm with the leadership of the Harris Walls campaign for their first interview about what happened in the election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=71.68s)]
*  Last week, Michael Tyler, who's the communication director for the campaign called me. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=77.38s)]
*  The president was really ending. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=79.48s)]
*  He knew I was going into election day and all of it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=83.12s)]
*  Thank you for doing this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=87.28s)]
*  Very much appreciate you having this conversation with us here on America. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=88.84s)]
*  Just a level set. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Jen, I'll start with you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=93.04s)]
*  How did you feel going into election day? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  And at what point did you have a sense that things were beginning to break Trump's way? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=95.48s)]
*  Was there a county results, something about the turnout? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Like, was there a moment when you sort of understood that how it was going to end? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=100.68s)]
*  Well, the truth is that we really thought this was a very close race. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=103.36s)]
*  We talked about the entire time we saw it as a margin of error race, almost the entire time the vice president was in the race. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  And we knew we had to have strong turnout on election day. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=112.56s)]
*  We saw early vote really ending strong for us and saw, you know, the types of voters we wanted to see turnout. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=115.8s)]
*  But, you know, we expected this to be close. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=123.04s)]
*  We also expected that Florida was going to come in a bit redder. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=125.48s)]
*  Virginia, we knew was tracking to being, you know, that we were going to be ahead, but that we would be ahead by less than we were in 2020. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=128.76s)]
*  So we were expecting to see that when we saw that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=134.84s)]
*  We also did anticipate that the night would go relatively long because some of these states would take longer to come in. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=137.0s)]
*  But I think it was, you know, really after polls close, there was nothing that we saw throughout the day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=143.0s)]
*  There was nothing that we saw that told us there was overwhelming turnout or anything out of complete expectations on Trump's side. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=146.28s)]
*  But it really took us into the hours of, you know, polls, close comments, an entire team talking over 90 minutes and not one good answer to a single question. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  This is actually worse than I thought. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=161.56s)]
*  Actually, we did really, really good. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=163.32s)]
*  It was like super hard. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=164.72s)]
*  The long and short of it is none of these people should ever run a national campaign again. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  The Obama era is over. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=169.92s)]
*  Let me save you 90 minutes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=171.48s)]
*  They learn nothing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=172.6s)]
*  It's like listening to corporate marketing department. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=173.48s)]
*  They don't actually get customers slash votes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=175.16s)]
*  There's such a huge disconnect. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  Pod save America is in a unique intersection because they are directly tapped into democratic establishment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=179.16s)]
*  They were a part of the democratic establishment under the Obama era and they have immediate access to the people that run these campaigns. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  But they are an independent media operation, which means they get comments, which means that their audience is not their audience is not directly, you know, MSNBC watchers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=193.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=208.88s)]
*  Sort by new on your video. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=209.52s)]
*  They're pouring honey on you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=211.08s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=212.8s)]
*  Which video? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=213.76s)]
*  Oh, the older video that I did with pod save America from before the election. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=215.16s)]
*  Wait, I do want to see that actually. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=220.16s)]
*  Is this, is it? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=221.76s)]
*  Here or did they post it somewhere else? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=222.48s)]
*  This is, this might be the official one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  What is this? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  Do you know that? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=227.72s)]
*  Do you remember the garbage day internet culture newsletter? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  Just remembered. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=230.72s)]
*  He said you should be the token left is on pod save law. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  Make a popular Twitch streamer. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=234.44s)]
*  I saw Puck is probably close to Rogan figure we have on our list. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=236.2s)]
*  He's masculine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  He's funny. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=239.04s)]
*  He's tapped in the video and culture is aggressively left wing, but he might be too political to capture the mainstream. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  Like Rogan has more importantly, Piker's a streamer. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=243.56s)]
*  Rogan has a podcast. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  You can download it any app and listen to it on the way. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=246.16s)]
*  Live streaming will never be as accessible. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=248.2s)]
*  Maybe the positive guy should hire him and let him yell at them for the next four years. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=249.76s)]
*  Law. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=253.0s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=254.16s)]
*  Oh, here winning those voters. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=255.48s)]
*  Dude, if you go back and watch this video, it is so different. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=257.32s)]
*  Bro was spinning straight facts and no one in the Democratic Party was listening. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=261.16s)]
*  Hassan is right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=264.56s)]
*  I'm a Democrat at 41. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=265.16s)]
*  The campaign is making me sad. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=266.64s)]
*  They keep moving. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=267.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=268.24s)]
*  Dude nailed what happened this week. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=268.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=270.96s)]
*  They're pouring honey on the goat because I was right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=271.16s)]
*  Have Sam hide on to talk about what's happening. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=273.76s)]
*  He's very erudite. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=275.96s)]
*  I have my disagreements with the song, but he was right about the bro vote. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  Age like fine wine. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=280.44s)]
*  Hassan was right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=281.68s)]
*  Aged very well. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=282.64s)]
*  Hassan sounds like a song was right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=283.44s)]
*  Trump won the Gen Z vote. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=285.72s)]
*  They should have had this dude in their campaign. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=287.24s)]
*  All his criticisms that were even before the election turned out to be the exact [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  reasons why the Dems lost the election. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=291.72s)]
*  Very, I mean, vindicated once again, permanently. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=299.24s)]
*  Hassan is a literal terrorist sympathizer, had a Huthi terrorist on a show and was [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=303.36s)]
*  laughing with him, laughing at videos of hostage has been taken contributing to chat [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=307.16s)]
*  on October 7th podcast saying they deserved it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  Colleagues, very, very celebrate was here to tears on a show and told them, we [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  support you stop normalizing this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=315.8s)]
*  We need a Rogan, but entirely different except for aesthetic. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=319.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  This is why, while it is in, it is incredibly self-serving for me to tell every [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  liberal person that I'm the Joe Rogan of the left, cause they're desperately looking [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  for one and then they should give me billions of dollars so that I can be the Joe [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  Rogan of the left. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=336.8s)]
*  I still have to be honest and say that you can't podcast your way out of this issue. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=337.88s)]
*  Would you appreciate the chance of doing something with Ezra Klein again? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=344.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  I reached back out to Ezra. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  So Ezra's team and I had long conversation, which was right before Kamala Harris [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=349.2s)]
*  became the nominee. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  We had a long conversation with Ezra about, about the Manosphere. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=357.76s)]
*  Ironically enough, you know what my take is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=362.92s)]
*  You know what I've said. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=365.72s)]
*  I've said this on the Pod Save America interview as well. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=366.72s)]
*  This was even months prior to that, but then Kamala Harris got swapped for the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=370.0s)]
*  candidate. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=374.76s)]
*  So they, they dumped that episode that we were going to do together, but I was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=375.32s)]
*  supposed to be on, no, I didn't ghost them. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=379.48s)]
*  I was supposed to be on the New York times pod with Ezra Klein and I was very [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=382.0s)]
*  excited for it too. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=387.0s)]
*  It's just that it didn't end up happening because obviously a lot more world [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=389.52s)]
*  shaking events occurred and, you know, that's neither here nor there, but we [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=393.6s)]
*  might do some in the future. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=398.6s)]
*  ...us to know for sure that things were not... [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=399.96s)]
*  We should be watching the Democratic Party. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=402.32s)]
*  Tightening, they were tight, but they weren't tightening in the direction we [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=404.36s)]
*  needed them to be. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=406.56s)]
*  And is that just because Trump's turnout was so high? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=407.24s)]
*  Well, honestly, I think, I think it's a little bit mixed. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we saw certainly Trump turnout high in early vote. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=412.92s)]
*  We really believe that to be mode shifting and that's what I think it was. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=416.64s)]
*  I think we also saw turnout was as expected in rural areas. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=419.72s)]
*  Like we didn't see anything that said, you know, like maybe we saw in 16 or even [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=423.12s)]
*  in 20 that he had more turnout than we had anticipated. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=426.56s)]
*  And our analytics really was quite close, much closer than it had been in 20 and in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=429.36s)]
*  16. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=433.52s)]
*  But I do think we saw some lighter turnout in some of the areas we had hoped, but [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=434.4s)]
*  difference of a point here or there, which obviously in a close race makes a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=437.6s)]
*  huge difference. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=440.4s)]
*  And then I think we saw a little bit of a drop in support in a few areas for us. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=441.4s)]
*  So that ultimately I think is why we weren't able to close the gap. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  It wasn't so much that what we were seeing the battlegrounds was out of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=448.92s)]
*  expectation or that he had some hidden turnout we hadn't picked up on. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=451.44s)]
*  David, when you say it was a margin of error race, you need a high turnout. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=454.16s)]
*  What did your polls tell you where the race was heading into election day? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, Dan, you and I talked prior to the election. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  And just to rewind, I think when Kamala Harris became the nominee, she was behind. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=462.24s)]
*  We kind of, you know, climbed back. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=466.24s)]
*  Yeah, this is the craziest part of this is that the new information, where the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=468.64s)]
*  **** is it, that shows that the Kamala Harris internal numbers also never showed [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=474.52s)]
*  that she was beating Trump. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=480.12s)]
*  It is a bit of a shocker for the record. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=481.88s)]
*  This is actually a shocker. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=484.12s)]
*  Harris campaign aid saying the internal polling never had heard of Trump is a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=485.96s)]
*  shocker. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=489.52s)]
*  Why is it a shocker? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=490.0s)]
*  Because they didn't even change their campaign strategy and they acted like [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=491.48s)]
*  they were throwing up LeBron numbers, dude is crazy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=496.48s)]
*  Like they were throwing on purpose. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=500.44s)]
*  Like what the **** going on? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=502.6s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the list. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=504.52s)]
*  Funny list, but good mention for you, G. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=505.56s)]
*  I saw it's a great list. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=507.32s)]
*  It's not a funny list. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=508.48s)]
*  I like the list. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=509.24s)]
*  The complex list. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=510.12s)]
*  I'm a number five. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=510.96s)]
*  I'm very honored to be amongst, you know, some of the, some of the best in the game. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=512.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=518.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris is internal numbers showing that they were doomed from the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=518.92s)]
*  jump is a **** nuts. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  It's nuts, especially when they were like, yeah, **** looking bad. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=525.64s)]
*  And then we just got to keep moving. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=529.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=530.6s)]
*  And even post debate, you know, we still had ourselves down, you know, in the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=531.8s)]
*  battleground States, but very close. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=535.48s)]
*  And so I think by the end it was a jump ball race and I think we needed some [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=537.5200000000001s)]
*  things to break our way. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=540.32s)]
*  Maybe Trump's election day turnout would underperform our election day turnout [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=541.08s)]
*  would, you know, either be at level or overperform and you know, we'd win more [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=544.88s)]
*  of the people who decided in the last three or four days, I think our data and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  the New York times date and other public data suggested we did have some progress [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  with undecideds at late October. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=554.72s)]
*  So it was a dead heat race, but you know, at the end of the day, um, you know, the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=556.2800000000001s)]
*  political atmosphere was pretty brutal and that's not an excuse. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=560.2s)]
*  You had right track, wrong track. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  I think 28, 72, about 70% of the country saying they were angry and dissatisfied. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=563.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=568.92s)]
*  And we, we saw that we saw that just like I constantly mentioned, remember, this [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=569.2399999999999s)]
*  was a thing that I mentioned all the time. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  And the campaign was like, we got to move directly in Joe. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=577.4799999999999s)]
*  We got to directly move towards Joe Biden, but then only try to outflank him [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=580.4799999999999s)]
*  by going more to the right. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=585.2399999999999s)]
*  We saw and did nothing. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  We saw and sometimes even did worse than nothing. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=589.64s)]
*  We saw that and we did the worst possible thing you could do. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=593.24s)]
*  You had Trump's approval rating on his first term, frustratingly high 48 to [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  51, depending on the state, obviously the incumbent president's approval rating [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  around 38 to 41, depending on the state. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=604.1999999999999s)]
*  Um, and you know, I think the economy and inflation still driving a lot of votes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=606.28s)]
*  So I think given that we had a challenging political environment, the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=610.88s)]
*  fact that we got the race to dead heat, um, was positive, but boy, it was slow [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=614.28s)]
*  moving and I think we were focused on seven states, um, you know, that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=619.0799999999999s)]
*  that's our windshield into the world, the battleground states. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=623.12s)]
*  But you know, what we saw on election day was, you know, New Jersey and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=625.72s)]
*  California and Connecticut and New York, massive shifts. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=629.44s)]
*  So I think where Kamala Harris campaigned, we were able to keep the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=633.44s)]
*  tide down a little bit, but it ended up being a pretty strong, uh, you [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=636.0s)]
*  know, tailwind for Donald Trump. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  And I think it's worth reminding everybody, um, we saw in 22, even though [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=640.92s)]
*  that was a pretty decent democratic year, we saw these shifts, we saw them in 20. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=645.08s)]
*  We saw them in 16, uh, you know, Trump specifically, but Republicans [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=648.6s)]
*  generally, please man, be honest. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=652.68s)]
*  The biggest mistake Harrison Harris made was saying the only difference [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=654.5999999999999s)]
*  between the Biden, she would have one Republican in the government. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=657.68s)]
*  She should have said to you're right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=660.16s)]
*  You're right. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=663.0s)]
*  Americans obviously were like, actually, how about all Republican members of the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=663.64s)]
*  cabinet? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  That's what they voted for. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's the only method to win. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=669.68s)]
*  That's the only way that we can win. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=671.76s)]
*  We have to become Republicans. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=673.12s)]
*  We just have to be Republican. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=675.4s)]
*  We are the real Republican party. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  Please vote for us. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=678.88s)]
*  Why is nobody voting for us? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=680.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=682.0s)]
*  Improving their vote share amongst non-college voters, particularly [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=683.0s)]
*  college voters of color. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=685.6s)]
*  Um, and this was a surprising race because Kamala Harris actually did, I [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=687.08s)]
*  think, better with senior voters than I think a lot of people would have thought. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=689.76s)]
*  So margin of error race where we inherited a deficit, we got it to even, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=692.4399999999999s)]
*  but the thing never moved. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=696.92s)]
*  So to Jen's point, I think we were, you know, we were hopeful. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=697.84s)]
*  I don't know how optimistic we were, but we thought, okay, this is tied. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=700.76s)]
*  And if a couple of things break our way and listen, I'm naive in this way. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=703.56s)]
*  I just thought at the end of the day, particularly because Trump did not close [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=706.36s)]
*  well, I thought, and I thought Kamala Harris closed well. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=708.56s)]
*  Trump was reminding people some of the things they don't like about them, that [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=711.1600000000001s)]
*  that might give us what we needed. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=714.0400000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think the political atmosphere, the desire for [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=715.76s)]
*  change, all those fundamentals that you've spent a lot of time talking about [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=718.12s)]
*  really presented huge challenges for us. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  So, you know, we got, we got there, but we didn't get the breaks we needed [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=723.12s)]
*  on election day. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=726.4s)]
*  How deep was the hole that you had to climb out of? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=727.36s)]
*  Well, Jen, I mean, I think, listen, there was the Biden Trump 1.0, which is [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=729.6s)]
*  obviously pretty catastrophic in terms of where the race stood when we got in. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=732.6s)]
*  My recollection is some of that snapback, but you know, we were behind. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=735.84s)]
*  I mean, I think it surprised people because there was these public polls that [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=738.84s)]
*  came out in late September, early October, showing us with leads that we never saw. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=741.68s)]
*  You know, I mean, it was just basically a race that in the battlegrounds was 46, 47, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=745.68s)]
*  47, 48. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=749.52s)]
*  So that's not where we started. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=750.36s)]
*  We started behind. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=751.48s)]
*  She was able to climb out. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=752.92s)]
*  I think even after the debate, we might've gained what, 0.51. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't a race that moved a lot. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=757.12s)]
*  And so I think when you think about our own internal analytics, you know, if you [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=759.12s)]
*  have Wisconsin at 47, 47, or Pennsylvania, 48, 47 Trump, let's say, which I think is [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=762.6s)]
*  where we had it at the end, you know, you've got to have undecided, break your [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=768.32s)]
*  way more than your opponents. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=771.2800000000001s)]
*  And you've got to get a little benefit from turnout, which we weren't able to do. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=772.6400000000001s)]
*  Obviously the defining event of this race was the candidate switch and everything, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=775.32s)]
*  every decision you guys had to make, everything you had to do was defined also [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=779.6400000000001s)]
*  by the compressed calendar in which you were operating. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=782.24s)]
*  Quinton, you were there when that's what happened. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=784.84s)]
*  How were you able, there was a one month period between the debate and when [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=786.9200000000001s)]
*  president actually dropped out. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=790.6s)]
*  Obviously it seemed like a dropping out could be a possibility. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=792.08s)]
*  Were you able to do any thinking in or planning in that one month period about [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=794.4000000000001s)]
*  what a race with the vice president looked like? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=797.92s)]
*  Or did you have to sort of start cold on that first day, the moment you got the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  call or the statement went out? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=803.72s)]
*  I mean, we started cold. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=805.12s)]
*  There was no planning involved in any other candidates. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=806.88s)]
*  I mean, we were honestly in crisis management mode of keeping President Biden in [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=808.76s)]
*  the race, you know, convincing, you know, Democratic allies that he could still do [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=812.16s)]
*  this. And one of the things was trying to keep the president out on the road as much. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=817.08s)]
*  We were still doing everything we could from a campaign. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=820.16s)]
*  And he made the decision that he did not want to continue on. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=821.88s)]
*  And he pulled some of the senior leadership together and said that he was going to be [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  with the vice president. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=828.16s)]
*  It also wasn't anything that our team took for granted to just say, OK, she is the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=829.52s)]
*  nominee. We knew that there was still a situation where we had to shore up delegates. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=832.56s)]
*  And that's where we started from. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=836.68s)]
*  And then after that point, that is when we begin to say, OK, how can we define her? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=837.92s)]
*  Also, Trump's favorabilities numbers. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=842.0799999999999s)]
*  We had to do something about that as well. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=843.4799999999999s)]
*  And so there was a lot of walking and chewing gum at the same time. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=844.88s)]
*  But there really was no sort of contingency planning to turn the race over to her right [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=846.68s)]
*  after that debate or at any point until President Biden definitively said he wasn't [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  going to continue on. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=853.7199999999999s)]
*  If I ran this campaign and never show my face again, why are they admitting this? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=854.4s)]
*  Because they're going to get rehired. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  That's why. What do you mean? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=859.4s)]
*  They've literally these people, maybe not so much, but people who are attached to the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=861.36s)]
*  campaign as consultants have been nonstop going on CNN and all of these other outlets [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=865.6s)]
*  to talk about how it was trans people that caused them the victory over and over again. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=874.24s)]
*  They they only get to be shameless. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=880.6s)]
*  They only get to be shameless because people let them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=883.56s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=887.36s)]
*  The Democratic Party consistently entertained and also elevates losers. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=889.2s)]
*  OK, because their goals overall is to maintain the status quo. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=895.84s)]
*  That's it. God forbid. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=901.56s)]
*  God fucking forbid that they disrupt the status quo. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=903.96s)]
*  Did you just say is literally people who are running the campaign saying that these are [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=908.44s)]
*  the people who are responsible for the campaign? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=911.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes. But other consultants that have also been a you know, that have played a formative [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=913.4s)]
*  role in the campaign have been endlessly going on CNN and defending their positions by [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=919.4s)]
*  saying we did everything right. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=925.04s)]
*  And the voters were either too stupid to recognize it, which is, you know, something [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=926.4399999999999s)]
*  that is, you know, if you say that out loud as a campaign person, like consultant, you [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=931.76s)]
*  should be fired permanently or saying that it's because we were just like too pro trans [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=937.28s)]
*  or too Latinx adjacent. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=942.8s)]
*  It's it's they there is a real crisis of talent in, I think, the Democratic Party. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=944.92s)]
*  And it is it's kind of like like it's kind of like police. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=950.88s)]
*  There is a culture of it is a culture of of hiring and and elevating losers over and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=954.28s)]
*  over again. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=961.12s)]
*  Stephanie, I think what probably surprised a lot of people in politics was the vice [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=963.64s)]
*  president was a largely unknown quantity to much of the electorate. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=966.0s)]
*  So you guys had under a very short time frame had to do two things. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=968.4000000000001s)]
*  As Quinn said, you had to teach people about her and also make a case against Donald Trump, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=970.4000000000001s)]
*  who would just come off. He was at an all time high. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  He came off the assassination attempt, the debate against the president. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=975.24s)]
*  In terms of messaging, how did you think about the balance between the two? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=978.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, the first thing we had to do is put on a convention. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=982.12s)]
*  And we had about three weeks to flip a convention that was being built around Joe Biden. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=984.52s)]
*  So that's why we didn't flip the. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  By the way, these are ironically enough, every single person here, I'm pretty sure, is [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=992.48s)]
*  also or was also a Joe Biden campaign strategist. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=997.4000000000001s)]
*  So that's the other part of this as well. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1001.5600000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris did not have her own staffers. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1003.48s)]
*  She has had a lot of turnover on her end, historically, even when she was vice president. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1006.1600000000001s)]
*  So, oh, yeah, with the exception of Plouffe, most of the people here are they were already [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1013.84s)]
*  on the Joe Biden campaign. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1020.92s)]
*  So if you're wondering why, you know, they have this perspective and if you're wondering [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1022.4799999999999s)]
*  why they're they might not even like shit on Joe Biden too much, that's the reason, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1027.28s)]
*  because that's the one like acceptable liberal take that I'm on board with, which is [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1031.8799999999999s)]
*  like if you blame Joe Biden, because there is truth to that. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1038.8s)]
*  OK, there is at least truth to blaming Joe Biden because he does share a significant [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1042.96s)]
*  amount of the blame, a significant amount of the responsibility, not dropping out, not [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1050.04s)]
*  gearing up for being a transitional candidate and propping up a VP pick that could have [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1054.68s)]
*  potentially won even Kamala Harris. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1060.6s)]
*  If you wanted to do that with her, like he didn't do that at all and not dropping out [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1062.24s)]
*  until the very last moment until he's forced to do so. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1067.84s)]
*  Like these are all massively consequential decisions that absolutely played a formative [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1070.24s)]
*  role in Kamala Harris's defeat. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1075.08s)]
*  But the former the former Biden staffers are not going to fucking say that either, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1076.84s)]
*  especially because they worked on that campaign, too. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1081.96s)]
*  We were able to flip it to fit this very new character of a different generation, different [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1085.56s)]
*  experience, different background. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1091.68s)]
*  And looking at the data at the time, which Jen and Pluff and Quentin have all talked [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1094.0s)]
*  about, there was she had a huge deficit in favorability because either people didn't [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1098.72s)]
*  know about her or what they did know about her was based off of negative media. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1103.04s)]
*  So our first priority was to define her in that convention, fill in her bio as part [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1106.84s)]
*  of that. You know, we already knew how to do the negative on Trump and we knew that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1112.1599999999999s)]
*  there was a lot of Trumpnesia out there. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1115.76s)]
*  People didn't remember the four years of the Trump administration that badly because [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1117.0s)]
*  they had been through hell. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1121.6s)]
*  They had been through covid both under his watch and under President Biden's. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1123.36s)]
*  I'm putting aside a lot of the details of who's at fault and what Biden did to dig us [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1128.76s)]
*  out and all of that. And then they had to deal with inflation. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1132.68s)]
*  So they had been through hell. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1135.3200000000002s)]
*  So looking back, you know, you remember a previous time much more fondly because you've [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  now think that you've gone through the worst. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1142.24s)]
*  So we had to remind people what life was like. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1144.76s)]
*  That was our second imperative. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1146.44s)]
*  And then the third imperative as part of the convention and leading into the remaining [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1147.8s)]
*  days of the campaign is what's that choice? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1151.8400000000001s)]
*  What are the what are the two very different visions between Trump and Kamala Harris? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1154.0800000000002s)]
*  So the convention, you know, it demonstrated a lot of enthusiasm for Kamala Harris, a lot [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1158.6000000000001s)]
*  of freshness, future oriented, bringing a variety of coalitions together. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1163.92s)]
*  We had independents, Republicans, Democrats, business leaders, sports figures. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1169.6000000000001s)]
*  What about the progressives? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1174.76s)]
*  Independence, Republicans, Democrats, business leaders, everybody coming together around. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, no mention of the progressives. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1182.0s)]
*  OK, that's you know, maybe that's a problem that like this does not factor into your [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1184.24s)]
*  equation at all. Perhaps that could be one of the major reasons why y'all fucked up. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1189.5600000000002s)]
*  A new way forward and finally turning the page. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1195.44s)]
*  So, you know, through the rest of that campaign, through the our next thing was the debate [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1198.16s)]
*  just a few weeks later. And I think it's really embarrassing to say we were trying to build [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1202.48s)]
*  a big tent with Republicans when Kamala Harris lost the greater share of Republican votes [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  than Joe Biden did with an objectively less. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1211.52s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden had an objectively more progressive campaign. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1214.96s)]
*  Billy D calls out Hassan. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1218.08s)]

*  to get people to come to the pizza down and get your meat out. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1613.84s)]
*  This man hit me up in D.M. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1618.08s)]
*  He's like, you killing it, you killing it, champ. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1619.36s)]
*  And this motherfucker just comes out like this. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1622.72s)]
*  Yeah. Hassan needs to be banned off a twitch. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1625.92s)]
*  No, Phil DeFranco is now on the ban Hassan train. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1628.96s)]
*  Oh, we're cooked. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1632.68s)]
*  We've lost another we've lost another pillar. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1634.2s)]
*  New hater online. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1636.92s)]
*  That photo. Oh, no. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1638.16s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1640.4s)]
*  We've lost the lives. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1642.3200000000002s)]
*  He banned Hassan train, but he's valid. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1643.72s)]
*  They say it was burned brightly before he went out, King. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1645.92s)]
*  All right, let's continue with boom, boom, boom. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1649.16s)]
*  All the way through probably early October after the walls debate [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1650.88s)]
*  that we had to move through these things so quickly. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1654.0s)]
*  Once we got through all of that, then the race started to gel. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1655.88s)]
*  And, you know, to the extent people were open to remembering what Trump [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1658.88s)]
*  what life was like under Trump, we were trying to fill that in. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1664.0s)]
*  To the extent people had questions about Kamala Harris, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1666.72s)]
*  we were still trying to fill that in. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1668.8s)]
*  So in one hundred and seven days, you know, what typically takes us [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1670.0s)]
*  a year and a half, two years in a presidential campaign, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1672.96s)]
*  we were defining someone who was wholly undefined from the start, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1675.04s)]
*  trying to remind people about the opponent and what life was like [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1677.96s)]
*  underneath him and also take into account what the political environment was [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1681.56s)]
*  and the realities that we had to deal with, which, you know, she was the incumbent, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1685.44s)]
*  which she really wasn't the incumbent. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1689.36s)]
*  People didn't know that much about her. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1690.96s)]
*  The economy was still slightly getting better, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1692.96s)]
*  but we couldn't really take care, take credit for it. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1695.6s)]
*  So I liked it. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1698.6s)]
*  The people tasked with defining a candidate that was not previously defined [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1699.52s)]
*  are talking about how they failed to do that. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1706.9599999999998s)]
*  But in a way where they're not taking responsibility whatsoever [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1710.32s)]
*  and simply just going, yeah, we couldn't market this product. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1714.4399999999998s)]
*  And it's like, dude, your job is to market the product. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1717.9199999999998s)]
*  You're talking about your incompetence in marketing the product while saying, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1722.04s)]
*  well, this is unmarketable. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1725.52s)]
*  She's still saying the economy was rebounding. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1727.0s)]
*  This is a thing that I kept repeating. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1730.0s)]
*  The economy in 2016 was, quote unquote, fine. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1732.32s)]
*  OK. And it seemingly was not fine for a lot of people, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1735.84s)]
*  so much so that they wanted to take a sledgehammer to these institutions. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1739.52s)]
*  Clearly, clearly, they did not consider it to be fine back in 2016 [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1743.04s)]
*  when they voted for Trump the first time. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1749.32s)]
*  It's like especially not fine now. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1751.32s)]
*  We were in a bit of a crossroads trying to figure out what that October [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1753.9199999999998s)]
*  messaging and closing messaging would look like. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1756.56s)]
*  Pluff, there is a sort of a debate outside of your campaign [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1758.56s)]
*  that the primary and most important thing to do was to educate voters [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1761.52s)]
*  about Kamala Harris and that voters knew all they needed to know about Trump. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1765.6399999999999s)]
*  I take it you guys disagreed with that analysis and you felt a need to at least [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1768.2s)]
*  knock his numbers out a little bit. Is that right? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1770.84s)]
*  Of course. I mean, that is nonsense. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1772.68s)]
*  So, first of all, back to where the question you were talking to Stephanie about. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1774.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris started this race, if I recall, with favorable 33 to 35. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1779.08s)]
*  She ended it at 48. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1782.52s)]
*  She actually ended the election with a higher approval rating than Donald Trump. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1783.92s)]
*  I'm not sure someone's won the presidency with a lower approval rating. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1786.28s)]
*  So I think as people got to know her, they liked her. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1789.4s)]
*  I think her approval rating now post-election is north of 50. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1792.6000000000001s)]
*  That was really hard work. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1794.92s)]
*  And I will say that, you know, think about if Kamala Harris had come out [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1795.72s)]
*  of a process that was traditional, running in and winning a primary. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1799.68s)]
*  So maybe become the nominee March or April. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1802.56s)]
*  You know, you spend a month, six weeks on your biography. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1804.48s)]
*  You keep coming back to it. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1806.8s)]
*  You define the Trump first term. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1808.24s)]
*  You raise the stakes of what a Trump second term would be like. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1809.8400000000001s)]
*  You have like a month just to run paid advertising on things like housing. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1812.08s)]
*  They didn't even do that well enough. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1815.24s)]
*  Like they didn't even define. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1816.8799999999999s)]
*  They didn't even remind people of like how shitty it was when Trump was president. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1818.04s)]
*  They didn't even do that well enough. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1821.56s)]
*  They did a horrible job at that. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1823.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh, my God, dude, they're going to run Kamala again. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1825.1999999999998s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1827.48s)]
*  I swear to God, bro, it is so. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1828.9199999999998s)]
*  Thing in your tax cut. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1833.36s)]
*  So this is where there was a price to be paid for the short campaign. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1834.48s)]
*  And you can't even say 107 days, because to Quentin's point, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1837.8799999999999s)]
*  some of that was spent shoring up the Democratic nomination. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1840.0s)]
*  Then you really have to have said everything you want to say [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1842.76s)]
*  by the time people start voting early. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1844.72s)]
*  So we had a little more than two months to do bio contrast on the economy, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1846.36s)]
*  on health care, raising the stakes of Trump. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1850.48s)]
*  So, yes, when you have a race where you've got the current [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1851.96s)]
*  incumbent president with approval ratings of, let's say, 38 to 40. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1855.68s)]
*  Never in history have we had this before, at least since, I guess, Grover Cleveland. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1859.44s)]
*  So once you have a former president running where 48 to 51 [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1862.12s)]
*  percent of the people approve of his first term and people are dissatisfied [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1865.6s)]
*  with the direction of the country, you have to raise the stakes [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1869.04s)]
*  of what a second term would be like. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1872.52s)]
*  So I think for us, we spent much more time trying to raise the stakes [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1873.68s)]
*  of the second term than re arbitrating the first, because voters [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1876.48s)]
*  just weren't open to that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1878.76s)]
*  So that's why pointing out, you know, his tariff and what that would mean [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1880.12s)]
*  in terms of a huge sales tax for the American people. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1883.0s)]
*  That's the chatter. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1899.04s)]
*  I don't know how to respond to you, Chatter. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1908.96s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1911.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe they've missed a few social cues. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  This election, the fact that he's more unhinged, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1918.04s)]
*  he wants unchecked power project 2025 ended up being about his poverty. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1921.52s)]
*  So we did a lot of good work there. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1925.6399999999999s)]
*  And now, of course, the son of a bitch lied about it. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1927.0s)]
*  And he's hiring everybody who authored it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1928.96s)]
*  Project 2025 is going to be the Trump administration agenda, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1930.4s)]
*  as we pointed out. So we had to do that. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1933.72s)]
*  So if we had just run a race solely on Kamala Harris positives, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1935.68s)]
*  though we did a lot of that on what Kamala Harris wants to do on the economy. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1939.08s)]
*  We did a lot of that. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1942.4s)]
*  It's worth reminding your listeners who live in California, New York [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1943.1200000000001s)]
*  or Alabama or Florida, you're not experiencing the presidential race [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1946.0s)]
*  as it's experienced in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1948.92s)]
*  We spent a lot of time. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1951.88s)]
*  She spent a lot of time driving a core economic view. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1952.96s)]
*  That was not enough. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1955.4s)]
*  When you've got someone whose first term was judged favorably enough [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1956.28s)]
*  by enough people given the election and people are dissatisfied [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1959.48s)]
*  about where you are now and you're part of that administration, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1962.0s)]
*  you have to basically raise the stakes. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1964.16s)]
*  And for us, it was on the economy. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1967.0s)]
*  It was on the fact that all the people who stood in his way last time [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1968.72s)]
*  were warning us about him. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1971.32s)]
*  It was about Project 2025. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1972.52s)]
*  It was about abortion. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1974.24s)]
*  And, you know, I think we did a good job of that based on our data, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1975.44s)]
*  but we had to stay on that. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1978.56s)]
*  So I think that that is an incredibly faulty reading [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1979.48s)]
*  that what we should have done is just lift up Kamala Harris. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1982.88s)]
*  We clearly did. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1984.88s)]
*  Her favorability rating increased by, I believe, 15 points. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1985.88s)]
*  If you look at who do you trust more to look out for people like your family? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1988.8400000000001s)]
*  Who do you think is going to fight for the middle class? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1991.8400000000001s)]
*  Huge progress for Kamala Harris. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1993.68s)]
*  Even on crime and immigration, we were able to make double digit progress. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1995.0400000000002s)]
*  So we were very focused on lifting her up. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=1997.64s)]
*  But to win a race like this, given the political atmospherics, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2000.0400000000002s)]
*  which were quite challenging, we had to raise the risk of a Trump second term. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2002.88s)]
*  Jen, you guys are obviously operating in a very, very tough [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2006.1200000000001s)]
*  political environment. Income and president, very low approval ratings. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2008.2800000000002s)]
*  As mentioned, wrong track, right track, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2012.1999999999998s)]
*  approval of the economy, all very challenging. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2013.9199999999998s)]
*  The also in the least, the public polling, huge desire for change. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2016.32s)]
*  Right. Frustration with the status quo. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2019.4399999999998s)]
*  Not just that's here in the United States, but we've seen that across the world [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2020.52s)]
*  since covid challenging place to be if you were the vice president [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2022.56s)]
*  to the unpopular incumbent president. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2024.96s)]
*  Felt like much of the convention, as Stephanie mentioned, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2026.9199999999998s)]
*  was trying to make her a change candidate. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2028.24s)]
*  Talk about turning the page. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2030.0s)]
*  Can you talk a little about how you tried to do that and whether you think [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2031.36s)]
*  she could or should have done more to distance herself from President Biden, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2034.4399999999998s)]
*  something I think as evidenced by the answer on the view [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2036.96s)]
*  she was at least personally uncomfortable with? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2038.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, look, first of all, I think people, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2040.32s)]
*  when they vote for president, want to vote about the future. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2042.6399999999999s)]
*  And they saw in the vice president someone they didn't know, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2044.72s)]
*  someone they didn't know a lot about a background. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2047.56s)]
*  So, you know, who she was, what she stood for, what she did as vice president. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2049.68s)]
*  So in every step of what we were trying to do, we had to tell [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2053.0s)]
*  a pretty robust story in one ad or one policy rollout or one event [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2055.64s)]
*  that you don't often have to do because of the time we were in. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2060.3199999999997s)]
*  But I do think. Yeah. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2062.68s)]
*  And what they arrived at was I'm a small business. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2064.3199999999997s)]
*  My mother is a small business. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2067.24s)]
*  I love small businesses because my mother was one. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2069.72s)]
*  Also, I prosecuted transnational gangs. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2073.52s)]
*  Joy. I have joy when I think about transnational gangs. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2077.12s)]
*  My favorite thing to think about is transnational gangs [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2081.3599999999997s)]
*  and the joy I have prosecuting them. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2084.2s)]
*  And also the joy I have when I think about small businesses [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2086.44s)]
*  in the opportunity economy. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2089.4s)]
*  How could this have failed, guys? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2091.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2093.3599999999997s)]
*  This was the greatest campaign message of all time. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2094.52s)]
*  Yeah, I love the border wall. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2097.2799999999997s)]
*  The border wall is great, actually. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2100.4s)]
*  I've decided the border wall is great after calling everyone [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2102.48s)]
*  that defended the border wall a racist for eight fucking years. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2106.16s)]
*  I also want to drill, drill, baby, drill every, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2111.2s)]
*  every concession that the Democrats made [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2116.0s)]
*  read as just simple hypocrisy. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2119.6s)]
*  That's it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2123.0s)]
*  Every concession that they made read as simple hypocrisy [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2124.36s)]
*  that the Democrats were trying to just say, oops, we got caught lying. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2128.6000000000004s)]
*  We actually like these things. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2133.1200000000003s)]
*  These things were good. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2135.1600000000003s)]
*  We were just lying when we said they're bad. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2136.2000000000003s)]
*  So why the fuck does that matter? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2138.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that we really focused from the get go on how she was [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2140.0s)]
*  different than everyone else, different than Joe Biden, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2144.04s)]
*  different than Donald Trump. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2145.92s)]
*  And at the end of the day, the choice was her versus Donald Trump. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2146.96s)]
*  And at the same time, you know, she was very clear [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2149.4s)]
*  that she was a new generation of leadership. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2151.84s)]
*  But it wasn't just like a statement. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2153.6s)]
*  It was here's what I need to focus on. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2155.08s)]
*  Her first policy announcements were economic, talking about housing, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2158.04s)]
*  talking about lowering costs, understanding that people really didn't feel [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2161.52s)]
*  like things were progressing in the way that they wanted to. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2164.92s)]
*  All of the right track, wrong track data. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2167.24s)]
*  But how she brought her own point of view to thinking about housing. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2169.12s)]
*  Sandwich generation, that was probably her biggest applause line, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2172.52s)]
*  one of the best testing things that we did. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2174.8399999999997s)]
*  That wasn't a poll tested. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2176.48s)]
*  Let's let's, you know, work on this poll, this this data to tell us [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2177.7599999999998s)]
*  this is the right issue we should go talk about. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2181.24s)]
*  That was about her life and also understanding what people in the country [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2182.7599999999998s)]
*  were really needed. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2185.68s)]
*  Oh, well, these people are I mean, I think these people just are bad. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2186.8799999999997s)]
*  That's it. And it's not like the Republicans are good or have better people. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2190.64s)]
*  They're just less bad, I guess. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2195.3999999999996s)]
*  And only because like Trump reads is more authentic than Kamala Harris does. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2197.72s)]
*  And these people will never understand why saying Kamala Harris is like [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2201.9199999999996s)]
*  trying to make it seem like Kamala Harris was like a unique orator. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2206.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, she came up with a sandwich generation all on her own, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2209.16s)]
*  because that's her real experience. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2211.4s)]
*  Like that's dog shit, dude. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  She was she had to make up for her [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2215.32s)]
*  lack of charisma with good policies. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2219.4s)]
*  And they're not going to talk about the policies anyway. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2222.6800000000003s)]
*  So why are you why are you acting like a thing that people genuinely did not? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2225.0s)]
*  People genuinely did not see as though it was the reality. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2230.2000000000003s)]
*  They like people saw her as a political [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2233.36s)]
*  people saw her as this like charismatic political figure [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2237.32s)]
*  that was talking about her genuine experiences in a way that translated to [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2239.68s)]
*  to broader acceptance. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2245.24s)]
*  So I think that in a hundred seven day race, it is very difficult to do [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2248.44s)]
*  all the things you would normally do in a year and a half, two years. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2252.3199999999997s)]
*  But I think wherever we had an opportunity, the vice president [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2254.9199999999996s)]
*  did put her own stamp on this and did it in a deeper way. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2257.68s)]
*  Then I think probably we got the kind of full breadth of coverage on it. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2261.3199999999997s)]
*  Of course, you know, when you have an administration that a lot of progress [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2264.24s)]
*  has been made and you're part of that progress, it's complicated when you're [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2267.56s)]
*  asked questions for so many people that talk about how closely they're tracking [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2271.0s)]
*  the data or how closely they're tracking, you know, even messages. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2277.24s)]
*  I wonder if they were closely tracking the messages around Gaza. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2282.36s)]
*  Was that a consideration at all? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2285.84s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2288.2s)]
*  Questions in certain ways. But at the end of the day, I think she really [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2289.12s)]
*  every time she turned, you know, talked to a voter every time she was out [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2291.7999999999997s)]
*  on the stump, she really leaned into her own vision. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2295.3199999999997s)]
*  But the headwinds were tough. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2298.08s)]
*  I will also, though, add, of course, we lost. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2299.72s)]
*  I'm not here to say that that didn't happen. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2301.96s)]
*  We would much rather not have that happen. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2303.8399999999997s)]
*  But where she campaigned, we did way better than the rest of the country. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2306.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump did worse to the point that you were just talking about with Plouffe. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2309.7599999999998s)]
*  The idea that people have just a well-constructed, already baked in [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2312.64s)]
*  idea about Trump and they don't need to learn anymore is just complete fallacy. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2316.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, his numbers are stronger today than they have ever been. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2320.56s)]
*  And that was critical for us. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2323.04s)]
*  And we also believe this race was not just about Kamala Harris. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2324.44s)]
*  It was Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2327.32s)]
*  And we had to set that choice in that frame up. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2329.0s)]
*  And I think that we were able to anywhere we campaigned in all seven of these states, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2331.28s)]
*  where Donald Trump, by the way, campaigned to he did worse and we did better. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2334.92s)]
*  And we did make real progress against these national headwinds in every other state. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2338.0s)]
*  But the battlegrounds, there was a negative eight point shift to the right. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2341.68s)]
*  And the battlegrounds, there was only three. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2344.7200000000003s)]
*  So we needed it to be better than that. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2346.32s)]
*  And perhaps if we had more time, we could have done that. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2348.12s)]
*  But I think that's fundamental that when people learn more about her, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2350.08s)]
*  understood what she stood for, where she came from and what her vision was. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2353.48s)]
*  They responded well to that and they responded in a favorable way, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2357.12s)]
*  especially in contrast. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2359.84s)]
*  Wow. We lost by less in states where we campaigned as opposed to losing even [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2360.84s)]
*  harder in states where we didn't campaign. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2366.76s)]
*  Brilliant. Yeah. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2370.56s)]
*  I mean, listen, we suck shit and we lost across the board and we're we're dogshit. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2371.64s)]
*  We're awful. It's like, you see, we could have lost by 20, but we simply lost by 14. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2375.76s)]
*  And that in and of itself is a victory. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2382.92s)]
*  Got it. To, you know, a point of view that Donald Trump will be worse. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2385.92s)]
*  And I think that's playing out right now. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2389.5200000000004s)]
*  Dan, on the Biden question, we, of course, got that everywhere. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2391.1600000000003s)]
*  We went and we knew what the data was. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2395.0s)]
*  We knew we had to show her as her own person and point to the future [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2397.28s)]
*  and not try to rehash the past. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2401.0s)]
*  But she also felt that she was part of the administration. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2403.4s)]
*  And unless we said something like, well, I would have handled the border [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2406.7200000000003s)]
*  completely differently. We were never going to satisfy anybody. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2410.12s)]
*  So we did talk about things like she's a different generation. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2412.8s)]
*  Most of her career is from outside of Washington, not inside Washington. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2416.0s)]
*  So she knows a lot of the best ideas are from across the country. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2418.84s)]
*  Her career has been about reaching across the aisle, finding common sense [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2422.68s)]
*  ways to get things done. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2425.84s)]
*  It's not been based in ideological politics. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2426.92s)]
*  All of these things we were trying to tell a story. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2429.2s)]
*  Oh, my God, they're so stupid, dude. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2432.48s)]
*  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wow. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2434.7599999999998s)]
*  This is worse than I thought. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2438.16s)]
*  I sometimes also fall into the same trappings that I urge chatters [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2439.92s)]
*  not to fall into and assume that like a person in a position of power [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2443.8s)]
*  is at least knowledgeable or somewhat more knowledgeable than myself [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2447.96s)]
*  or more intelligent. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2452.16s)]
*  I tell you guys all the time, like, you know, some of these Congress [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2453.8s)]
*  persons are dumb as fuck, right? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2456.4s)]
*  But we tend to forget how fucking stupid the average person in D.C. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2459.16s)]
*  might be because they're, you know, wearing suits and they're [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2463.36s)]
*  speaking in a professional cadence. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2467.48s)]
*  And and and yet I'm in awe at how resilient [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2469.28s)]
*  there the stupidity is overall. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2475.16s)]
*  She said, she said, Oh, look at all. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2477.92s)]
*  Look at all of our successes of showcasing Kamala Harris [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2480.48s)]
*  as like outside of the D.C. bubble. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2483.64s)]
*  How did she present that? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2485.7200000000003s)]
*  By fucking saying common sense solutions across the country. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2487.6s)]
*  I mean, this is so unimaginably, so unimaginably arrogant [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2491.28s)]
*  and and so silly and so wrong. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2496.16s)]
*  Wow. Americans love common sense solutions, sir. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2499.6s)]
*  You don't understand. That's why she said it. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2503.4s)]
*  It's like they love bipartisanship. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2505.72s)]
*  That's what we need to do. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2508.16s)]
*  That's why they, you know, that's why the candidate that has never actually [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2509.52s)]
*  even remotely broached bipartisanship defeated our bipartisanship candidate [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2512.88s)]
*  because Americans love bipartisanship. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2518.7599999999998s)]
*  And give the impression that she was different without pointing to a specific issue. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2521.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's just why not a specific issue is that she was willing to do your it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2525.2799999999997s)]
*  You've already feel disingenuous or because she felt like she was part [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2528.96s)]
*  of the administration. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2532.52s)]
*  So why should she look back and pick out cherry pick some things [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2533.2s)]
*  that she would have done differently when she was part of it? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2535.48s)]
*  And she also she had tremendous loyalty to President Biden. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2538.16s)]
*  And, you know, if we had said, just imagine this, I mean, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2541.7599999999998s)]
*  you've been on plenty of campaigns. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2545.4s)]
*  Imagine if we said, well, we would have taken this approach on the border. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2546.6s)]
*  Imagine the round of stories coming out after that of people saying, well, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2550.48s)]
*  yeah, good. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2554.32s)]
*  Yeah, that would have been good. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2555.76s)]
*  That would have separated you in the eyes of the electorate [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2557.6s)]
*  from the unpopular guy that you were replacing. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2560.84s)]
*  That's called good media, not bad media. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2564.04s)]
*  Oh, drama. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2566.96s)]
*  Why is Kamala Harris separating herself from Joe Biden? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2569.04s)]
*  That's a story that benefits the campaign. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2573.0s)]
*  Wow. That kind of publicity would be good. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2576.08s)]
*  You know, she never said that in the meeting or what meeting when she said this. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2579.8s)]
*  Or I remember when she did that. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2583.28s)]
*  And it was just it wasn't going to give us what we needed [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2584.88s)]
*  because it wouldn't be a clean break. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2588.48s)]
*  It would be, you know, days upon days and a limited time window that we had. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2589.8s)]
*  You know, it's really fucking stupid about this. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2594.76s)]
*  They did not in any type of way [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2596.6000000000004s)]
*  feel uncomfortable with Kamala Harris distancing herself [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2599.5600000000004s)]
*  from her very public declarations [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2604.88s)]
*  from four fucking years ago. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2608.96s)]
*  But God forbid she distanced herself [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2611.24s)]
*  from the guy that made it made the situation so dire [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2615.56s)]
*  that you had to substitute yourself in his place to run for president. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2620.44s)]
*  They have no issue distancing from progressive policies [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2626.2799999999997s)]
*  that she had, quote unquote, fake championed her own fucking platform [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2629.84s)]
*  that made her look like a buffoon, a hypocritical phony [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2634.7599999999998s)]
*  to those who even pay close at the cause enough attention. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2640.52s)]
*  But the only ways in which she was able to distance herself successfully [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2644.1600000000003s)]
*  from Biden was when she was hugging and kissing and fucking and sucking [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2649.4s)]
*  Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney. Ridiculous of dealing of who, what, when, where. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2653.52s)]
*  So the best we could do and the most that she felt comfortable with was saying, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2658.92s)]
*  like, look, vice presidents never break with their presidents. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2662.56s)]
*  The only time in recent memory is when Pence broke with Trump [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2665.44s)]
*  after Trump stormed the Capitol. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2669.6800000000003s)]
*  So they call that the murder exemption. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2672.6400000000003s)]
*  The president tries to murder you can break. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2675.56s)]
*  If you are, you know, ripping up the Constitution, trying to overturn [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2677.96s)]
*  an election, people die, then you could break with your president. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2680.28s)]
*  But absent that, vice presidents stick by their presidents. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2683.32s)]
*  And she wasn't willing to, you know, change that precedent [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2687.04s)]
*  for whoever the future president vice presidential partnership would be, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2690.36s)]
*  because it would mean a whole, you know, different set of. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2693.6s)]
*  Yeah, we must not break norms. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2696.6400000000003s)]
*  Excuse me. I love the rules and the norms. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2698.48s)]
*  I am the norms abider. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2701.64s)]
*  I am the rules and norms respecter. We must not break them. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2703.76s)]
*  OK, then why the fuck is Kamala Harris running for president? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2706.88s)]
*  Why? Why is Kamala Harris president then? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2709.84s)]
*  That's a or sorry, running for president. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2712.04s)]
*  She didn't become president. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2714.28s)]
*  That was a violation of the norms. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2716.32s)]
*  The fuck problems as if we don't have enough problems in our democracy right now. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2717.92s)]
*  So unless we were willing to say, you know, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2722.2s)]
*  Biden said green and she said blue on any particular issue, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2725.2400000000002s)]
*  but we're never really going to satisfy that. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2728.7200000000003s)]
*  So our focus was let's look to the future. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2730.12s)]
*  Let's describe her and her approach to things. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2732.1600000000003s)]
*  Let's use policies, future looking policies to demonstrate that difference. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2733.7200000000003s)]
*  But in the end, you know, we've all seen the data. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2737.88s)]
*  It's the too many people thought that you'd be a continuation, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2739.6s)]
*  which on the economy was, you know, the incumbent killer. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2743.28s)]
*  Quentin, in the post-election analysis, there's been a ton of focus [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2746.7200000000003s)]
*  on the very ubiquitous trans ad that Trump campaign spent tens of millions of dollars on. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2749.32s)]
*  There have been sort of two strains of all this one, the sense that her position [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2752.76s)]
*  and the Democratic Party position on trans related issues are one of the reasons. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2757.44s)]
*  There's nothing funnier than talking about the economy being the incumbent killer. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2761.08s)]
*  I'm like, you know, Mexico was right there, dude. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2765.2000000000003s)]
*  Mexico is literally right there. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2768.52s)]
*  AMLO was an old dottering man, but he was very well liked. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2770.96s)]
*  Part of the reason why it was very well liked aside from his daily fucking live [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2776.48s)]
*  stream broadcast that completely defeated any kind of stranglehold [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2780.0s)]
*  that corporate back mainstream media in Mexico could have was the welfare [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2784.44s)]
*  expansion policies that he implemented. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2788.2s)]
*  AMLO as the dottering old man who believes in fucking duendes, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2790.48s)]
*  Wood Elves was able to successfully transition power from his hands [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2796.96s)]
*  into Claudia Scheinbaum, not just a woman, not just any woman, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2802.0s)]
*  but he presented her as his successor, but a Jewish woman in a country that's like 98% [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2806.56s)]
*  Catholic. How the fuck did that happen? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2813.24s)]
*  I guess maybe the Wood Elves are real and they made it happen. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2815.28s)]
*  It's like right there. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2817.6s)]
*  You can just point directly to what is going on as a successful strategy. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2818.76s)]
*  Now, it would be very funny if someone were to say [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2823.0s)]
*  Mexico is simply more woke than the United States of America. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2826.52s)]
*  Right. Like between the U.S. and Mexico. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2831.36s)]
*  I mean, they are more woke on women's rights, at least when it comes to abortion, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2834.72s)]
*  unconditionally offering support for abortion. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2838.12s)]
*  There are places in America that are worse than Mexico now on abortion. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2840.64s)]
*  That part is real. Having said that, however, it has some of the highest fucking [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2844.8399999999997s)]
*  rates of femicide on the planet. What are we talking about? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2848.8799999999997s)]
*  Perhaps there was some other reasons. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2851.7999999999997s)]
*  That's why we lost. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2854.72s)]
*  But also real questions about why the campaign decided not to respond to the ad [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2856.56s)]
*  specifically, my understanding from reporting at least is that you guys [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2860.24s)]
*  tested a bunch of responses and it didn't and they didn't work. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2862.96s)]
*  Just tell me your thinking there and what role you think that ad [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2865.2400000000002s)]
*  and those issues actually played in the race. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2867.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, it's important to put everything into context. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2868.8s)]
*  We've, you know, very well established the time frame. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2871.76s)]
*  And it's honestly a lot shorter than one hundred and seven days. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2875.1600000000003s)]
*  But we had three core objectives to the paid media to define the vice president. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2877.0800000000004s)]
*  It was to defend her on incoming attacks. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2880.8s)]
*  And a lot of these attacks have been baked in [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2882.92s)]
*  for the past three and a half years while she was the vice president. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2885.04s)]
*  They were attacking her. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2887.4s)]
*  You know, she was at negative 20 something on immigration. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2888.96s)]
*  We got that down to negative 10. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2892.04s)]
*  Trump had a positive 22 point advantage on the economy. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2893.64s)]
*  We got that down to seven and we had to respond to those things. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2896.04s)]
*  And when you sort of looked at the core issues, aside from the attacks [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2899.12s)]
*  like trans issues are just at the bottom for voters, the economy, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2901.6s)]
*  inflation, crime, immigration are the top issues. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2905.68s)]
*  They were also some of the issues that she was getting attacked on [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2908.92s)]
*  into the element of sort of defining her and doing it in a way [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2911.44s)]
*  that sort of fit within what you're trying to do. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2913.68s)]
*  There's a direct approach that you can take to anything. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2915.44s)]
*  And then there is an approach that you can take that accomplishes [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2917.04s)]
*  two of the three objectives. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2919.4s)]
*  A lot of the stuff that we did, such as talking about her prosecutorial [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2920.68s)]
*  background and then saying that she went after transnational gangs, cartels. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2923.9199999999996s)]
*  It was to push back suitably on the immigration attacks [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2927.68s)]
*  that were coming at her, as well as credentialing her background [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2930.8399999999997s)]
*  on things that were absent and standalone. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2933.52s)]
*  Yeah, that shit really did numbers, man. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2936.3999999999996s)]
*  You guys you guys banged on that. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2938.3199999999997s)]
*  Everybody loved when she kept saying she prosecuted transnational gangs. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2940.3999999999996s)]
*  The Biden administration, we did a lot of stuff about her record as AG, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2943.9199999999996s)]
*  her record as a prosecutor, not as vice president, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2946.7599999999998s)]
*  because it also allowed her to stand alone separate from the Biden administration [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2949.0s)]
*  on the trans attack one. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2952.36s)]
*  Obviously, it was a very effective ad at the end. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2954.2s)]
*  I ultimately don't believe that it was about the issue of trans. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2956.36s)]
*  I think that it made her seem out of touch. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2959.0s)]
*  And it was sort of a pseudo economic ad underneath it [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2961.68s)]
*  because he was saying you're going to pay for it with taxpayer money. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2963.76s)]
*  And it was in her own words. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2966.68s)]
*  And that's something. But we tested a ton of responses to this [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2967.88s)]
*  direct responses, and none of them ever tested as well as basically her, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2970.64s)]
*  you know, talking about what she would do to Jen's point, the future, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2975.48s)]
*  the type of president that she would be. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2978.24s)]
*  There were elements of it where we did try to say, you know, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2979.7599999999998s)]
*  and we put ads on television. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2982.4s)]
*  Dude, the only reason why that kind of shit is even remotely effective [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2983.72s)]
*  when it's not like in the same in the same breath. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2988.2s)]
*  This dude literally openly admitted that trans issues are the bottom [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2993.16s)]
*  of people's priorities. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2997.68s)]
*  That means they are also the bottom of of transphobes priorities as well. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=2999.64s)]
*  They don't give a fuck. OK. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3005.2799999999997s)]
*  Which means all of this is a distraction [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3007.16s)]
*  and it's only an effective distraction if you don't have any campaign messaging [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3010.2799999999997s)]
*  that the Republicans are are more focused on dismantling. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3015.96s)]
*  That's it. Say you are in support of Medicare for all. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3019.56s)]
*  And then watch the Republicans try to land a tax against that. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3022.8799999999997s)]
*  Be like, it's socialism. We focused tested it. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3026.3599999999997s)]
*  There were no answers. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3028.8799999999997s)]
*  It's like, yeah, because you're not fucking offering adequate answers to the. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3029.8399999999997s)]
*  They care about they, them, not you. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3034.48s)]
*  Ad, which you which people still think is a fucking banger ad. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3037.24s)]
*  It's so stupid. It only worked on the Democratic Party staffers and [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3040.56s)]
*  I guess the consultant class and those who are over at CNN and shit. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3045.3199999999997s)]
*  That was not a good ad at all. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3049.3599999999997s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck about trans people. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3050.7999999999997s)]
*  The most effective counter to that is to go, really? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3052.92s)]
*  You think trans people are the reason why your egg prices are so high? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3055.3199999999997s)]
*  You fucking idiot. That's all you got to say. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3059.16s)]
*  I didn't realize all landlords in America were trans. OK. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3061.3999999999996s)]
*  I didn't realize that, like your boss, every boss in America is trans. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3065.84s)]
*  Every corporate executive is trans or an undocumented migrant. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3069.44s)]
*  Problem is, they love the corporate executives. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3073.44s)]
*  They love the bosses and they love the landlords, so they can't fucking say [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3076.7200000000003s)]
*  anything about them. It's so dumb. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3080.04s)]
*  You could usually just said this hyper fixation on trans people is weird as fuck. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3082.48s)]
*  They're your neighbors. Nobody cares about this. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3086.96s)]
*  They are not the reason why your rent is going up. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3090.52s)]
*  They're not the reason why the price of a cart of milk is so goddamn high. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3093.64s)]
*  But they didn't do that. And also, that alone doesn't work unless [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3098.48s)]
*  that messaging alone doesn't work, unless you also have like positive [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3103.44s)]
*  policies that you can point to that directly respond to people's material [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3107.12s)]
*  circumstances. That deflection is successful. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3111.44s)]
*  As long as you also have other policies, that deflection wouldn't even [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3115.08s)]
*  that deflection wouldn't even matter. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3118.96s)]
*  You wouldn't even need to do that deflection. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3120.56s)]
*  If the Republicans were too busy running against the positions that you are [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3122.88s)]
*  pointing to, that you are going to do like they did with the price gouging shit, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3127.2000000000003s)]
*  which was a demonstrable failure for the Republicans. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3132.32s)]
*  And yet they stopped hammering that point. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3135.2400000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris could have gone up there and been like, dude, look, look, listen. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3137.4s)]
*  Tens of millions of Americans turned around and were like, oh, we're going to [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3141.0s)]
*  deport 20 million people. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3144.36s)]
*  As long as it lowers the price of eggs, I'm in. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3146.44s)]
*  OK, some people didn't believe it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3150.2s)]
*  Some people believe that some people were hateful about it and they definitely [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3152.56s)]
*  wanted it and they voted for it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3155.64s)]
*  But most people were just like, is the price of eggs? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3157.08s)]
*  Is the price of bread? Is the price of of milk? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3159.56s)]
*  Is the price of my treats, wages and wage growth did not outpace inflation. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3163.16s)]
*  That's it. That's simply it. That's the point. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3168.48s)]
*  That's the only point that matters. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3170.52s)]
*  And Republicans were like, yeah, we're going to we're going to lower the price of [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3172.24s)]
*  all the goods by deporting 20 million migrants. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3175.68s)]
*  And they were like, OK, I'm on board. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3178.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris on the other side could have literally turned around and been like, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3179.36s)]
*  oh, you want the price of eggs lowered? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3182.92s)]
*  I'm jailing the Walton family. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3184.6400000000003s)]
*  Which message would resonate better with voters? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3187.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying she should do this. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3189.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not even saying that that would actually lower the price of eggs. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3192.2000000000003s)]
*  It would probably lower the price of a lot of shit. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3194.84s)]
*  But my point is, Americans didn't give a fuck at that point. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3196.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, they didn't give a shit about what Kamala Harris was was was going to do [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3200.7200000000003s)]
*  in an effort to to lower the price of eggs. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3205.92s)]
*  OK, yeah, Mexico also recently just renewed price control measures as well. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3209.08s)]
*  As of November 11th, Claudia Scheinbaum said on Monday that she would renew [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3213.6800000000003s)]
*  an agreement with food producers and retailers to keep the price set [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3218.08s)]
*  of basic groceries affordable for consumers. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3221.32s)]
*  The measure had been rolled out by her predecessor, former President [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3223.0s)]
*  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in twenty twenty two as inflation was as high as it has been [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3225.1200000000003s)]
*  in two decades. We want prices to come down for consumers, especially for those who don't [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3230.32s)]
*  have much time bomb who took office at the beginning of October, said in her morning [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3233.76s)]
*  press conference. The new accord will be signed on Wednesday or Thursday. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3237.32s)]
*  Lopez Obrador, a shine by his mentor, launched the price controls in collaboration [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3240.48s)]
*  with the private sector on a set of groceries, including corn tortillas, rice, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3244.5600000000004s)]
*  soap, tomatoes and toilet paper. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3247.92s)]
*  Lo and behold, especially the working poor in Mexico. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3249.92s)]
*  Fucking treat. I'm like a goddamn deity, dude. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3253.52s)]
*  They love him. I know that there's a lot of resistance, libs and shit like that in Mexico. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3256.4s)]
*  But, you know, the numbers on the board, look at his fucking approval rating. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3261.1200000000003s)]
*  Look at her approval rating. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3264.6000000000004s)]
*  Look at the numbers that she won by. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3265.8s)]
*  People do not forget there are fucking people who voted for Trump because they thought [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3268.32s)]
*  that they would get stimulus checks. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3272.6000000000004s)]
*  OK, people don't forget the last time that the government actually did something right by them. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3273.92s)]
*  I don't think you guys understand. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3278.76s)]
*  Yeah, her approval rating is 74 percent right now. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3280.5600000000004s)]
*  Amal peak was 84 percent. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3282.6000000000004s)]
*  Another example of this is fucking China. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3284.32s)]
*  People always get mad, but like Harvard studied the Chinese attitudes towards the government [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3286.2400000000002s)]
*  and were shocked by the results like these guys are not in the pocket of China. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3292.1200000000003s)]
*  They're not invested in making a pro China, a pro China fucking message at all. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3295.76s)]
*  Chinese government approval ratings are consistently 90 plus. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3301.4s)]
*  And it makes sense when you think about it, if you're if you in your lifetime saw [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3306.32s)]
*  a relatively like like an agrarian society, go from that to having like tier one cities [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3312.44s)]
*  pop up left and right with like 20 million plus people, you're going to be like, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3317.5200000000004s)]
*  this is the greatest. I love this. Oh, my God. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3321.5200000000004s)]
*  We've become a dominant force on the planet. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3323.6000000000004s)]
*  Why the fuck wouldn't you be happy in that situation? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3325.96s)]
*  Of course you would. It's like not that difficult of a concept to grasp unless you're a fucking dumbass [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3328.5200000000004s)]
*  American and you forgot what democracy is supposed to be about. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3334.0s)]
*  And I'm not even saying that about China in general. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3336.84s)]
*  I'm just simply saying that governance, good governance and democracy is supposed to be about [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3339.0400000000004s)]
*  offering things to your constituents. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3345.48s)]
*  OK, the greatest example I can also point to that you're seeing cycle after cycle is the black vote. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3348.28s)]
*  Why is it that the black voting bloc has consistently been more pro-democrat the older they get, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3354.48s)]
*  more liberal, the older they get, their voting patterns show that the black voting bloc is [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3361.52s)]
*  significantly more pro-democratic party, the older they get, it's because they remember the last fucking time [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3367.1600000000003s)]
*  the Democrats actually expended political capital for them. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3372.88s)]
*  That's it. And the further you move away from the Civil Rights Act, like the further you move away from that time, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3376.04s)]
*  generationally speaking, the more people move away from the party. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3384.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it's the same with queer people still being so in the pocket. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3387.24s)]
*  We still remember 2014. Yeah. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3389.88s)]
*  But that's like impossible to contend with for a lot of people. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3391.6s)]
*  Americans are so cynical about the way they analyze politics that they literally think it's actually bad [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3395.72s)]
*  when a politician quote unquote buys votes. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3407.2s)]
*  That's called politics, man. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3411.6s)]
*  That's called doing right by your constituents. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3413.72s)]
*  What do you mean fucking buying votes? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3416.12s)]
*  I've said this for years. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3418.04s)]
*  It's like we are so lost in the sauce, so overcome with the expectation that politicians are never [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3419.24s)]
*  supposed to do right by you, that when they actually are entertaining the notion of offering you something, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3427.0s)]
*  people think, oh, it's cynical. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3434.2s)]
*  They just want to buy votes. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3435.8s)]
*  Oh, you mean be a democracy. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3437.16s)]
*  That's what you mean. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3438.92s)]
*  I can't believe that they're not simply in the pocket of corporations and their interests. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3440.12s)]
*  There's something wrong here. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3445.68s)]
*  It's like, yeah, there is. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3447.12s)]
*  There's a lot wrong here. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3448.12s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3449.6s)]
*  Holy moly. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3451.04s)]
*  You know, for saying you've seen all the negative attacks against me and try to bottle it up, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3453.16s)]
*  because I also think you have to think about the entire sentiment when you're running a paid campaign [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3456.52s)]
*  and the trans ad, I think because of the content, a lot of people felt like it was much bigger than what it was. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3459.72s)]
*  But to put that into context, Team Red, meaning Trump and all the super PACs that were spending on Trump's behalf, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3464.04s)]
*  that was seven percent of their total ads was on that issue. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3468.8s)]
*  Was that specific? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3471.28s)]
*  That I think was two ads, right? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3471.8s)]
*  There was the original and then there was all the Charleribade. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3473.36s)]
*  And it was all Trump. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3475.0400000000004s)]
*  So Trump spent, you know, thirty seven percent of his, you know, two hundred million on that ad. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3476.0s)]
*  But Trump wasn't the only spender. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3480.32s)]
*  We were getting hit across the board. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3481.92s)]
*  And so you have to take into account what all the super PACs are doing and play off of that. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3483.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think that's what Trump was doing. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3486.28s)]
*  His super PACs were hitting us on the economy, immigration and crime. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3487.48s)]
*  And Trump even started hitting us on immigration. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3490.5200000000004s)]
*  And I think the veracity of which we came out of the gate and responded to that, they weren't expecting that from us. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3492.1200000000003s)]
*  And then they backed off of that. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3496.6000000000004s)]
*  And at that point, they started going into it. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3497.64s)]
*  And so it is easy to say with the kind of resources that we raised, we should have been able to do everything. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3499.04s)]
*  But that's not the case. You have to make decisions in the time frame that we were in in this race. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3503.2799999999997s)]
*  We had to choose and we chose to focus more of our attention. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3507.7999999999997s)]
*  But you had a billion dollars that you raised in like a week. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3511.7599999999998s)]
*  What part of this analysis is Liz Cheney? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3515.4s)]
*  Where does she come in? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3517.8399999999997s)]
*  I can't watch the rest of this, man. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3519.08s)]
*  I can't even entertain this shit is so as let's get to some real thinkers. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3520.52s)]
*  Let's get to some real thinkers. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3524.44s)]
*  OK, that's right. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3526.44s)]
*  It's time to be fucking value tamed. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqmaSlylns&t=3528.16s)]
