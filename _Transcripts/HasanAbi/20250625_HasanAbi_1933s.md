# They Tried To Smear Zohran On Live TV | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E)
*  You call my voice. The rent is too damn low. We must work to ensure that rent gets higher [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=0.0s)]
*  year over year. My opponent Zoran ma'am. Dabby wants to make the rent get low. Put anti-Semitism [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=9.48s)]
*  aside. Can someone please explain to me how a guy who's never held a real job throws around [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=26.64s)]
*  populace empty promises of giving away everything for free. Like some video game is qualified [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=30.2s)]
*  to run the most important city in America. Are people that stupid? I can never tell if [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=34.36s)]
*  this guy is like a meme or if he's just like, I've, I see this guy all the time and I can't [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=38.96s)]
*  tell if it's like he's like supposed to make Israel look bad or good. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Night missions of my IDF unit wishes. Good luck is his pin tweet. Like you can't, first of all, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=54.72s)]
*  you can't be an Israeli in Israel and talk about giving away free money. Okay. You can't do that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=62.2s)]
*  Like you're literally, you're literally relying on my taxpayer dollars to subsidize whatever kind [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=73.48s)]
*  of endless military conquest that you want to engage in and whatever child you want to murder. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=82.56s)]
*  So you can get that in stupid, stupid over comprehensive healthcare for free. Okay. Broad [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=87.52s)]
*  coverage for free. I want to hear from, I don't want to hear from no Israeli about how on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=97.76s)]
*  socialism, socialism. Like I don't want to hear about, I don't want to hear from an [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=105.36s)]
*  Israeli occupying force about how, you know, this guy has not even ever held a real job, bro. Your [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=113.92s)]
*  job is not real. Your job is literally murdering babies. Okay. Like how do you [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=121.52s)]
*  know that? This shit pisses me off, man. And it's like this guy's so much bad-mouthing, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=135.84s)]
*  extensive healthcare. I know annoying. I mean, it's silly. Zoran fan cam in it. I have never [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=141.92s)]
*  had to resign. And he wanted to say what he just stopped himself. It feels like [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=150.16s)]
*  Mom, Donnie success. Spotlights, a deepening rupture among us Jews. While Zoran, I'm Donnie [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=153.12s)]
*  one over some Jewish supporters. Other Jewish Democrats suggested that dismissing a movement [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=165.84s)]
*  in a city they helped build mom, Donnie won a higher percentage of votes from Jewish New Yorkers [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  than many other ethnic or religious demographics won the endorsement of Lander and Nadler. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=174.4s)]
*  It seems the bourgeois press will not stop until Jews conform their Zionist, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  Islamophobic narrative. This shit is tired. Yeah. To be fair, there's a rupture. It's just [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=182.32s)]
*  the Jewish fascist blog is smaller than they'd like to think. Yep. That's precisely what it is. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=191.2s)]
*  There's like, there's like a small, but incredibly loud and incredibly annoying contingency of, of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=200.0s)]
*  fascists that want to be the only representative of Judaism in this goddamn country. And they never [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=206.72s)]
*  shut the up. And there are so many Israel backed advocacy groups and so many lobbying initiatives [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  and so many of these like supposedly, you know, Jewish advocacy groups that are supposed to be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=221.84s)]
*  passed with like working on issues that pertain to like American Jews, but instead only focus on [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=227.36s)]
*  pro-Israel rhetoric and defending the nation state of Israel. How low is your IQ? Pretty low. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=234.32s)]
*  I'm pretty stupid. Probably smarter than you though, considering that you're in here watching me, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=243.44s)]
*  giving me money. Cannot be said enough how ostracized anti-Zionist Jews are too. I basically [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=249.76s)]
*  don't post anything about it on my personal IG at all because I get flooded with smarmy shit from [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=254.32s)]
*  other Jews I know and family members. Yeah. I mean, guys, there are like, I'm, there are other [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=257.44s)]
*  Jews out there who are anti-Zionist, you know, like I think it's on at a certain point is on like you [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=267.12s)]
*  guys also to like seek this out. Like I don't, I, I, I know Zionist Jews. Of course I live in West [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=273.2s)]
*  Hollywood, you know, there's plenty of Zionist Jews around me, but the overwhelming majority of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=281.2s)]
*  my close friends are, are anti-Zionist Jews. It was like, this is not even a, I don't know. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=288.24s)]
*  I think there needs to be more, more community building [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=300.24s)]
*  on that front. That's what needs to happen. Exactly. Same could be said about Islam, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=304.4s)]
*  Muslim brotherhood, having ties with multiple governments, Diyanet building mosques in European [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  countries. Yeah. No, totally. Dude. The, the Islamic advocacy is so ever present a force, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  especially when it comes to Western foreign policy, it's identical to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  unconditional loyalty and support to Israel. Thank you. Dumbass Turkish anti-Islam atheist moron in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=328.8s)]
*  the chat. Love. Love when stupid ass Turks who've never stepped foot outside of the country say the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=336.8s)]
*  most idiotic shit like this. If this person is not a Turk, he's a Nazi because no one knows what [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=345.68s)]
*  Diyanet is. Okay. You gotta be a, only thing that was correct is atheist. Okay. All right. Then [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=353.68s)]
*  Nazi there's a 0% chance. There is 0% chance is Diyanet. They know Germans know Diyanet. They're [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=366.0s)]
*  working to get rid of it. There is no comparison dog. There's no comparison to any sort of like [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=381.92s)]
*  Islamic council to the endless amount of support for, for Israel. Like what are you talking about? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  Diyanet is the, is the ministry for religious affairs [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=403.36s)]
*  in Turkey. And they're saying that the Turkish ministry for, for religious affairs is like funding [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=407.04s)]
*  mosques all around Europe. Are you not sensitizing yourself by banning him? No, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=420.88s)]
*  I ban whoever the fuck I want. What'd you think this was? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=430.64000000000004s)]
*  You think I'm the government? What is sensitive? I know he's about to go on. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=433.12s)]
*  Jen Pesaki on MSNBC, the briefing with Jen Pesaki. We're about to be hit with a Pesaki bomb, baby. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=442.4s)]
*  Maybe I've heard the, maybe I've heard it too much, but like, come on, hit them with a little [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=452.16s)]
*  bit of the whole, like, like a lot of this stuff, a lot of these, a lot of these issues, right? Like [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=456.64s)]
*  these, these hysterics that we're exhibiting in terms of like, Oh, I'm a small Jewish being, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=462.64s)]
*  and I'm afraid of this guy because he's Muslim. Right? Like when I, when I hear that, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  I know what that is. I know what you're doing. Okay. And I want other people to know what they're [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=480.4s)]
*  doing too. That's just racism. Okay. That's just racism masquerading as like, as, as a sincere [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=485.2s)]
*  critique because you have real fears. Like, why am I supposed to entertain this? Okay. What do you [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=495.12s)]
*  mean? What do you mean? You're afraid of Zoram Mdani being mayor of New York. You're just a racist [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=501.84s)]
*  piece of shit. Like to me, that is on ironically no different than what Charlie Kirk's been posting [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  about nonstop. Like, Oh, nine 11 is going to happen again. That type of shit. A lot has happened [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=513.68s)]
*  in even just the last 10 days or so since we spoke in a race where he was pulling 10 points behind [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=519.3599999999999s)]
*  just four weeks ago. Last night he gave a victory speech and here's part of what he said. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=527.52s)]
*  Tonight we made history [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=534.64s)]
*  in the words of Nelson Mandela. It always seems impossible until it is done. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=537.6s)]
*  Now, Mamdani ran in a crowded primary field, very crowded against 10 other candidates. One of those [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  candidates was the presumed front runner from the very beginning. You can see him on the screen. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=560.88s)]
*  You know who he is. Former governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace four years ago after 11 [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=565.68s)]
*  women accused him of sexual harassment. And yet somehow, despite that, this mayoral race, this [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=572.4s)]
*  primary was supposed to be Andrew Cuomo's comeback. And somehow, despite all of that, he had all the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=581.92s)]
*  traditional backers that you might expect for a normal democratic front runner who wasn't accused [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=590.0s)]
*  of sexual harassment about 11 women. He had all of them. Most of the major unions endorsed him, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=595.68s)]
*  with some notable exceptions, I'll say, like Sean Fann's UAW. He also had virtually all of the money [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=601.04s)]
*  on his side, including a record-breaking $25 million from a pro-Cuomo super PAC funded largely by [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=606.96s)]
*  Michael Bloomberg, Trump donor Bill Ackman, yes, that guy, and the delivery company DoorDash. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=614.0s)]
*  Cuomo also had many of the old school big name political endorsements, including from people [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=620.4799999999999s)]
*  outside of New York who decided to get involved, like former president Bill Clinton [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=625.8399999999999s)]
*  and Congressman James Clyburn. I guess for some, and I've been thinking about this, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=630.4799999999999s)]
*  why they endorsed, there's lots of reasons, I suppose. The fear of supporting a young [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  self-described socialist overtook the fear of supporting a credibly accused serial sexual [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=640.8s)]
*  harasser, I suppose. That's one of the reasons. But despite Cuomo's advantages on paper, the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=645.68s)]
*  endorsements, the money, all of that, and his very high name recognition, which is certainly an [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=651.5999999999999s)]
*  advantage, he ran what has been described repeatedly as a joyless campaign. He was largely [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=657.04s)]
*  shielded from his critics, he avoided tough interviews, and he campaigned in overall a pretty [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=664.56s)]
*  unimaginative way. By contrast, Zoran Mamdani ran a campaign that could not have been [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=670.48s)]
*  any more different. I mean, for starters, he showed up on social media with creative [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=677.6s)]
*  videos from the very beginning like these. I'm freezing your retin as the next mayor of New [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=681.76s)]
*  York City. Let's plunge into the details. We have just begun our walk through the entirety of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=688.88s)]
*  Manhattan. We're outside because New Yorkers deserve a mayor that they can see, they can hear, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=699.12s)]
*  they can even yell at. New York is suffering from a crisis and it's called halal inflation. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=703.6s)]
*  I'm about to say something to you you've never heard a politician say. Please stop sending us [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=717.04s)]
*  money. I'm putting out the call to New Yorkers. Assemble! [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=722.0s)]
*  They were joyful, they were authentic and funny, and each and every one of them either explained [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=727.68s)]
*  what he would actually do as mayor or gave voters practical information about how and where to vote, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=733.6s)]
*  which is incredibly important when you're trying to turn people out who don't always vote. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=739.12s)]
*  But Zoran Mamdani's campaign was also a massive organizing success. I mean, the campaign says it [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=743.12s)]
*  recruited over 40,000 volunteers who knocked on more than one million doors before election day [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=748.0s)]
*  and he showed up in places where he wasn't expected, which is pretty key in a big lesson, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=753.76s)]
*  like Crown Heights, which is a historically black and Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn where Mamdani [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=759.12s)]
*  held one of his final campaign events. Despite Andrew Cuomo's direct appeal to those exact voters, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=763.92s)]
*  Mamdani won that neighborhood by 26 points. He won for a range of reasons, partly by sharing [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=770.72s)]
*  his contagious love for New York City, whether it was eating an egg and cheese at a bodega or [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=777.68s)]
*  riding the Staten Island ferry. He did it by running a campaign that was optimistic, that was [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  hopeful and aspirational. One where he thought he said what he thought, not necessarily always what [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=787.5999999999999s)]
*  was politically popular. And he did it by speaking to the core economic struggles of millions of [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=793.28s)]
*  people in the city. I believe we can freeze the rent for more than two million tenants [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=799.04s)]
*  and build hundreds of thousands of affordable homes. I believe we can make the slowest buses [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=806.96s)]
*  in the nation fast and free. And I believe that we can deliver universal child care [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=813.6s)]
*  to make it easier to raise a family in this city. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, what is right in New York City isn't necessarily right for every city or every [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=828.24s)]
*  state in the country. The demographics are different, the issues people care about and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=832.32s)]
*  they grapple with are different unquestionably. Maybe Mamdani will be one of the leaders of the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=836.0s)]
*  Democratic Party, maybe not, we'll see. But regardless, this race is what makes politics [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=841.68s)]
*  joyful and inspiring. Someone who everyone underestimated, someone who was doubted and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=847.44s)]
*  questioned and attacked with racist mailers and attack ads, someone who the gray hairs in the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=852.32s)]
*  party said was too young, too inexperienced to win, overcame all of that. Look, it's so easy to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=856.56s)]
*  be cynical in politics. And believe me, I've been around a long time to rely on what you've [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=864.16s)]
*  always known, whether it is the names or the styles of campaigning, the types of events, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=868.24s)]
*  or even the policies that poll well. But that playbook is tired and that playbook no longer [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=872.56s)]
*  works. Clearly. It's not over though, either. And this is part of what we're going to talk about. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's still a road ahead. The primary race won't officially be called before the rank [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=883.6s)]
*  choice votes are tallied next Tuesday, though it seems very clear Mamdani will have a big advantage. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=887.76s)]
*  And I'm dying still needs to win in November. He will face another disgraced opponent, Eric [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=893.2s)]
*  Adams, who has the distinct honor of having made a deal with the devil in the white house to stay [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=898.0s)]
*  out of jail. So he has that on. Finally, dude, this is the, this is the actual liberal socialist [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=901.84s)]
*  allegiance, by the way, this kind of coverage, this kind of partisan wedge being driven between [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=908.6400000000001s)]
*  like enemies of Zoran. Like this is, this is exactly what you're supposed to hear from liberals [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=914.6400000000001s)]
*  falling in line and backing a true progressive candidate instead of standing in opposition to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=921.28s)]
*  him. But what he accomplished last night is also a reminder that Brad Lander is not a liberal. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay. He was a card carrying DSA member and dues paying part of the DSA until 2023. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=932.0s)]
*  Voters who you are reaching out to feel that you are a person who cares, who wants to speak for them. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=937.28s)]
*  I wouldn't even go, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even say he's a democratic socialist. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=942.0s)]
*  He has a huge gift for that. Joining me now for his first national interview since yesterday's [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=946.48s)]
*  election in New York city is Zoran Ramzani. It's great to see you. I don't know if you've slept [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=951.04s)]
*  and I'm sure you are still processing what happened last night. A lot of people on our [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=956.16s)]
*  team stayed up and watched your speech. I just laid out how I think you garnered as much support [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=961.52s)]
*  as you did. What, as you've processed this, what, what did I miss? I think you covered quite a bit [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=967.76s)]
*  of how we got to this point. And I think the only thing I would really add is this volunteer team [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=974.24s)]
*  that we've built of now more than 50,000 people. They are the New Yorkers for whom democracy had [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=979.44s)]
*  started to lose meaning. It started to lose its relevance to the struggles of everyday New Yorkers. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  And they are the ones who for so long had not seen themselves in our local politics. And yet they are [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=992.08s)]
*  also the ones who brought us to this point, who knocked on more than one and a half million doors [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=996.8800000000001s)]
*  across the five boroughs and showcase that a vision, currently the most expensive city in the United [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1001.5200000000001s)]
*  States, a vision that would make it affordable is one that speaks not only to progressives, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1007.6s)]
*  but speaks to New Yorkers across the five boroughs from Harlem to Bay Ridge and speaks to the very [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1012.16s)]
*  fact that ultimately what city government's job is, is to make this city that much easier to live [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  in and actually achieve the very dreams that brought you here in the first place. As I'm sure [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1023.44s)]
*  you know, you probably haven't consumed all of it, I suppose, but there's been a lot of analysis, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1028.72s)]
*  a ton, on what your success last night and in the last couple of weeks means nationally for the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1033.92s)]
*  Democratic Party. Unquestionably, it means something about how people campaign, but what do you think [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1040.0s)]
*  it means? I think it is part of a larger referendum on where our party goes. And I think one of the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1047.28s)]
*  hopes that we had from the very beginning of this campaign was to move our political instinct from [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1054.3200000000002s)]
*  lecturing to listening. You know, at the national level after the presidential election, we saw that [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1059.28s)]
*  New York was actually the state with the largest swing in the country towards Donald Trump, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1064.0800000000002s)]
*  11 and a half points, and that that swing took place far from the caricature of Trump voters, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1068.56s)]
*  instead taking place in the hearts of immigrant New York City. And I went to those neighborhoods, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1072.96s)]
*  I went to Fordham Road in the Bronx and Hillside Avenue in Queens, and I asked those New Yorkers, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1077.8400000000001s)]
*  the vast majority of whom were Democrats, why they voted for Trump and what it would take to [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1082.24s)]
*  bring them back to the Democratic Party. And again and again, what I heard from them was cost [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1086.56s)]
*  of living, was an inability to afford the very things they recalled being able to purchase four [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1091.6s)]
*  years ago. And when they told me what it would take, they said again and again, a relentless focus [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  on an economic agenda. And ultimately, in listening to them, we built a campaign that was explicitly [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1101.36s)]
*  about making the city affordable. And I think too often in politics, there's a desire to impose what [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1107.6s)]
*  you think the debate is upon the people that you're seeking to represent, as opposed to listening [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1113.12s)]
*  to the very issues that are making it difficult for them to keep calling the city that they love, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1117.6s)]
*  the city that they live in. I mean, you're running on issues that are very relevant to people in New [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
*  York City, the cost of housing, free busing. Some have projected, you know, that this is the type [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1127.76s)]
*  of platform that would work in other parts of the country. I mean, you're a proud Democratic [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  socialist. Do you think that is a platform that would work for other candidates running in other [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1138.08s)]
*  parts of the country? Absolutely. I think ultimately, this is a campaign about inequality. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1143.1999999999998s)]
*  And you don't have to live in the most expensive city in the country to have experienced that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1149.6s)]
*  inequality because it's a national issue. And what Americans coast to coast are looking for [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1153.76s)]
*  are people who will fight for them, not just believe in the things that resonate with their lives, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1159.1999999999998s)]
*  but actually fight and deliver on those very things. And part of how we got to this point [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1163.28s)]
*  was through the endorsements of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1167.76s)]
*  Sanders, who've been leading this fight against oligarchy across the country. And I think that [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1171.84s)]
*  in focusing on working people and their struggles, we also return back to what makes so many of us [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1176.64s)]
*  proud to be Democrats in the first place. Let's talk a little bit about the path forward here, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1182.24s)]
*  because you still have to win a general election and that is going to be hard fought, which I know [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1187.6s)]
*  are on track to defeat Andrew Cuomo. He called you to concede afterwards a couple of times. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1193.28s)]
*  He seems to have floated this potential plan or consideration of running as an independent. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1198.24s)]
*  Are you preparing for him to run as an independent in the general election or do you think it's [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1204.32s)]
*  possible he could drop out entirely before next Tuesday? I think that everything is possible in [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1208.6399999999999s)]
*  this race as we've seen over many, many months. And ultimately we are prepared for taking on [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1214.48s)]
*  whomever our opponents may be in November. Because when I started this race, I started it [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1219.76s)]
*  running against Eric Adams' second term, running to finally have a city government that sought [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1223.84s)]
*  to resolve the affordability crisis, not exacerbate it. And when Eric Adams dropped [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1229.2s)]
*  out of the Democratic primary, it was Andrew Cuomo that picked up the mantle of that second term, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1233.36s)]
*  the same donors, the same corruption, the same small vision funded by big money. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1237.6s)]
*  And we have now defeated that vision in this primary and I'm prepared to no matter who it [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1242.0s)]
*  is that's carrying it. If Andrew Cuomo drops out, he had a lot of big money backers. Do you think [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1246.16s)]
*  they're going to big money back Eric Adams? Is that what you're preparing for? I think that it's [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1251.68s)]
*  possible. I also think that we have found exactly the way to the defeat organized money, which is [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1256.4s)]
*  organized people. We're speaking about a scale of a campaign that we haven't seen in the city in a [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1260.96s)]
*  long time. And ultimately we believe in a politics of no translation, one that is both direct to the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1265.52s)]
*  struggles of working people's lives and also delivered directly. And there is nothing more [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1270.96s)]
*  direct than a New Yorker knocking on another New Yorker's door. And that has been such a key part [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1274.96s)]
*  of this campaign's ability to break through more than $30 million in opposition spending, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  where New Yorkers were blanketed with attack ads, whether it be when they were turning on [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1284.48s)]
*  their television, their radio, opening their mailbox, or even just watching YouTube. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1288.48s)]
*  And we were still able to triumph over that. Both Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1292.0s)]
*  obviously two Democratic leaders, have had some, I guess, nice things to say, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1297.1200000000001s)]
*  I could describe them as, about you, but didn't endorse you and still haven't endorsed you almost [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1301.6s)]
*  24 hours after Andrew Cuomo called you to concede. Why do you think that is? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1307.52s)]
*  Well, I appreciated both of their remarks, both their acknowledging of the focus of this campaign [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1312.56s)]
*  on affordability and also with Senator Schumer having worked with him closely to deliver close [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1317.84s)]
*  to half a billion dollars in debt relief for thousands of working class taxi drivers, as well [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1322.3999999999999s)]
*  as successfully defeat a proposal to build a frat gas power plant in my district of Astoria [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1326.88s)]
*  in western Queens. And I think what we are seeing in this moment is an understanding of the mandate [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1331.5200000000002s)]
*  that New Yorkers have given us to deliver on this affordability and also the fact that we will wait [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1337.68s)]
*  a few more days to see the actual final results of this, although we know that we have won this [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1342.72s)]
*  race even without the assistance of rank choice voting. Do you, I don't think endorsements win [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1347.5200000000002s)]
*  elections necessarily, but there's not a lot of proof of that in history, but do you want their [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1353.12s)]
*  support or do you not care if they come out and forcibly endorse you? I want their support and I [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1358.24s)]
*  want the support of any leader across this city and this state and this country because ultimately [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1363.28s)]
*  what we are looking to show New Yorkers is the fact that this is an ever-expanding coalition. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1368.1599999999999s)]
*  It's not one that is trying to keep tabs of when people join this fight, it's one that's looking [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1372.96s)]
*  to actually deliver on this fight. And what that means is ensuring we use every single tool at our [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1376.8799999999999s)]
*  disposal to freeze the rent, to make buses fast and free and to deliver universal childcare. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1381.6s)]
*  So Ron Mondani, we have to take a very quick 92nd break. We're going to be right back. Please stay [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1385.76s)]
*  right where you are. This is, this is good endorsing her after he won his crazy work. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  What Elizabeth Warren, what were you expecting? That is the most expect. That is the most Warren [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1398.08s)]
*  esque outcome here. Are you kidding me? That's classic. That's classic Elizabeth Warren. That's [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1404.96s)]
*  classic Liz, dude. Just broke Sharia law in New York. They are sending me to Muslim jail. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1411.1200000000001s)]
*  I voted for this. It's normal for endorsements to come raining in after the, the primary victory, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1416.64s)]
*  by the way, it's not, it's not abnormal. So I'll launch break. Okay. I've been meaning to try this [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1425.04s)]
*  a rap. It's pretty good. How was the food? My friend. Oh, my friend. So what am I? Mango juice [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1433.36s)]
*  is Mala. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1446.24s)]
*  Yeah, this is what happened in Staten Island. This is literally what happened is white boy, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1454.3999999999999s)]
*  summer. Damn. That did numbers. Comrade lamb. That's crazy. It's so funny. Cause I used to think [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1458.56s)]
*  Jacob burger before, like a long, long time. When he first went viral, I thought it was a hog [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1463.4399999999998s)]
*  cause he was always like, he looked too much like a cop before I knew what he was about, like way, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1469.6s)]
*  way before I'm talking years before I, I, I initially thought he was like kind of a whole [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1476.96s)]
*  party that you have to decide what side you're on and not endorsing is choosing on the side of [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1482.96s)]
*  billionaires. But do you see it that way? How do you see it? You know, I think what we're seeing [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1488.08s)]
*  New Yorkers face a choice of, especially over the course of this primary election was whether they [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1494.8s)]
*  wanted a candidate in the campaign of the past that was funded in the same way that so many [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1500.16s)]
*  campaigns have been, which is by the very billionaires and corporations that I am looking [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1506.0s)]
*  to tax to make the city affordable for each and every New Yorker. And we've seen the people of [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1510.16s)]
*  New York city make their choice. We've seen them make that choice in a manner that has little [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1514.0800000000002s)]
*  precedent in recent years. And ultimately that's the choice that I'm most excited about. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1518.96s)]
*  I know you were working to expand your coalition because you are being very careful, which you are [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1524.4s)]
*  running in a general election. And I understand that. So I want to ask you about one aspect of [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1529.3600000000001s)]
*  that, because you're running to be the mayor of the city with the largest population of Jewish [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1534.0s)]
*  people outside of Israel and the world. And at a time, which I know you know, because you've [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1539.52s)]
*  addressed this before, when there's been a significant uptick in anti-Semitic rhetoric and [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1544.24s)]
*  hate crimes against Jews, it's very scary to be a Jewish American right now. And you've been [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1548.8s)]
*  criticized by a number of Jewish leaders, as well as the U.S. Holocaust Museum for your defense of [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1555.76s)]
*  the phrase, globalize the Intifada. Last night in your speech, you alluded, so I know this is on [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1560.8s)]
*  your mind, you alluded to concerns from the Jewish community, even vowing to reach further [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1565.6s)]
*  to understand the perspectives of those whom you disagree. So for Jewish New Yorkers, I mean, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1569.36s)]
*  this is sort of the first day, the race hasn't been called, but you did give a speech last night [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1574.6399999999999s)]
*  claiming victory and your opponent did consistently interview, watching right now, single, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1578.56s)]
*  I'm not sure if you can effectively represent them. What's your message to them tonight? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1583.6799999999998s)]
*  My message is that I am looking to lead this entire city to represent each and every New Yorker. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1589.1999999999998s)]
*  And that representation is not contingent on whether or not I'm done with this. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1594.64s)]
*  For me, or sorry, this is so much of a leader. It's so much constantly asking, constantly asking [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1598.64s)]
*  this dude like Jewish Americans, constantly asking the Muslim mayor who's very clearly not an anti-Semite [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1606.72s)]
*  horrific attacks that we saw in Washington, DC to entertain the hysterics of like Israel supporters, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1613.92s)]
*  not even like Jewish voters in general, which very clearly voted for him. But, but just like [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1620.48s)]
*  Israel supporters, he now locks the door and they're psychotic hysterics born out of racism [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1627.1200000000001s)]
*  is so fucking annoying because of a fear of who may come in. I spoke to a friend of mine after [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1632.48s)]
*  October 7th, who told me about going to his synagogue for Shabbat services and hearing the [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1637.1200000000001s)]
*  door open behind him and turning around with a tremor going up his back, not knowing who was [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1642.88s)]
*  walking in and what they wished for them. And ultimately it's through the conversations I've [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1647.92s)]
*  had with Jewish New Yorkers that I have developed a proposal for the department of community safety [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1652.24s)]
*  that would include an 800% increase in funding for hate crime prevention programs. Because [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1658.48s)]
*  ultimately we cannot simply say that anti-Semitism has no home in this city or no place in this [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1663.8400000000001s)]
*  country. We have to do more than talk about it. We have to tackle it. And that's what we will do [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1668.8000000000002s)]
*  through this funding and through this commitment. We will root out bigotry across the five roads. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1672.88s)]
*  As you're looking to kind of appeal to people or connect with people who are skeptical, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1677.92s)]
*  what does that look like for you over the next couple of months to the members of the Jewish [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1682.8000000000002s)]
*  community, to some of these leaders who have been critical? What should they expect and anticipate? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1687.76s)]
*  They should expect my continuing to reach out, most especially to those who are concerned or [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1694.3200000000002s)]
*  who do disagree. Because ultimately in politics too often you surround yourself only with those [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1698.72s)]
*  that are quickest to say yes or quickest to already be in the same place as you. When in fact, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1704.4s)]
*  we have to be able to navigate that disagreement and that tension. And I often think about the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1708.8000000000002s)]
*  words of a previous mayor, mayor Koch, who said that if you agree with me on nine out of 12 issues, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1713.6000000000001s)]
*  vote for me 12 out of 12, see a psychiatrist. And I think of an elder Jewish woman who came up to me [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1718.0s)]
*  at Benai Jesharin, a synagogue. I've heard this so many times. Look here, this is cranky. Nelson's [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1723.0400000000002s)]
*  taken is perfect. This guy says, well, there was a pretty good 100 year run for Jews in New York [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  City. It's probably time to start making a plan on where to go next. Cranky Nelson says, this is [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1732.56s)]
*  just racism. You don't need to be compassionate about this. You don't need to try to understand. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1736.48s)]
*  It's very simple to understand. These people are foaming at the mouth races who think they can [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1740.1599999999999s)]
*  cloak it in self victimization. Sorry, pal, sell it somewhere else. It's so crazy. That's all this [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1744.32s)]
*  is. It is a fucking racist framework that utilizes pre-existing real marginalization. Okay. That's [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1751.04s)]
*  what it is. A real form of marginalization that has no systematic marginalization in contemporary [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1759.36s)]
*  society. Like antisemitism is not a systematic form of oppression. Okay. In the way that like [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1767.36s)]
*  anti-blackness is in contemporary society, there were parts throughout American history where it [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1776.08s)]
*  certainly was. It's not the same any longer. The idea that this is like blow up my car. The idea [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1780.4799999999998s)]
*  that my family and the people that I love and I've spoken to many across the city who have shared [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1787.44s)]
*  that their fear of having to be essentially branded a terrorist just by living in public life [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  is one that keeps them preferring life in the shadows, life outside of that specter. And this [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1798.8s)]
*  is not the way that we can have our city be. It's not the way that we can have our country be. This [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1804.72s)]
*  has to be a place where we understand the mutual belonging of each and every person here. And I'm [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1808.0s)]
*  lucky to have friends and family that keep me moving through this. I'm lucky that I'm able, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1813.36s)]
*  through my campaign, to have security and also to have the assistance of the NYPD in both investigating [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1818.08s)]
*  these threats and ensuring that I have the same public safety that each and every New Yorker [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1823.84s)]
*  deserves. New York, as you well know better than anyone, you've probably had food from every single [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1828.08s)]
*  culture in New York. So there's that. But it is a very diverse city. There's a huge Muslim American [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1833.12s)]
*  population in New York City as well. You would be, if you're elected, and you've got a ways to go [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1839.36s)]
*  here, but the first Muslim American mayor of New York City. What is that? It means a lot. You know, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1844.9599999999998s)]
*  I think about my grandmother, Kulsoom, and my grandfather, Yousuf, and how they taught me from [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1850.7199999999998s)]
*  a young age that to be a good Muslim is to be a good person. It's to help those in need and harm [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1855.76s)]
*  no one. And ultimately, I've sought to do that over the course of my life, and especially in a time [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1860.4799999999998s)]
*  when the mere mention of being Muslim is seen as if it is a slur. It is also an opportunity for me [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1865.84s)]
*  to introduce the fact that being Muslim is like being a member of any other faith. It is [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1873.6s)]
*  believing and belonging in a notion of equality and in solidarity. And I know that it is so [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  meaningful for the million Muslims that call New York City their home to see the fact that [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1883.52s)]
*  representation can be something that exists not just across the five boroughs, but also in City Hall. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1889.4399999999998s)]
*  So, Ramamdani, I hope for people watching who are just meeting you, who are thinking about running [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1894.96s)]
*  for office, think it's not possible, think they can't connect with their communities or don't know [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1900.3200000000002s)]
*  how to do it, whether they agree with you on everything or not. They don't have to, that they've [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1905.8400000000001s)]
*  found some inspiration in your story. It certainly has been for many people. Thank you so much for [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1910.8000000000002s)]
*  joining me tonight. Thank you so much. Because Islamophobia has so much institutional prominence [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1915.44s)]
*  and can masquerade as though it's like totally an act of self-defense from another marginalized group. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1920.96s)]
*  Okay. Because [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TggVYf_5E&t=1926.8s)]
