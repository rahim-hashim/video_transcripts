*  The motor can't handle the dumper. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, when I and usually what I do being Amerifat is [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=2.24s)]
*  I'll stand up and I'll let the bed do its thing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  No, I'll just stand up and like move the bed, but I couldn't do it. It just wouldn't move. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=12.44s)]
*  So then I had to manually do it with the with the air stewardess. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=18.92s)]
*  Okay, first and foremost, I'm a song by greatest thoughts that I broadcast coming to you live from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=30.04s)]
*  coming to you live from France, Viva France. That's right. We are in the France and you're hearing all the mouth noises because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=35.04s)]
*  you're hearing all the mouth noises because like my I updated my road caster software [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=43.44s)]
*  and it literally won't read it. And just here. This is the problem here. It just actually doesn't read it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=50.0s)]
*  And I have no way of actually tweaking the gain. So there's no noise gate. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=56.32s)]
*  There's no noise gate on the on the road caster software today [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  from the last time [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  that I actually took out the noise gate on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=70.04s)]
*  My on my road caster so they released us on for the even won the Super Bowl a no matter [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=74.24000000000001s)]

*  about. So ladies and gentlemen boys girls and enbies I am in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=86.24000000000001s)]

*  It is the victory day a very nice a very cool very nice very cool [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=94.16s)]
*  I like too much a very good and I assume that the audio purpose can be extra extra annoying today [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=99.92s)]
*  So I'm very excited for that and there's literally nothing I can do about it, which makes streaming button. So help me God [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=108.36s)]

*  The person on the plane, yeah [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  Pretty limited [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, I she left the iPad with me [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=601.4s)]
*  so I actually did do something mischievous where I checked the button because it says like [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=603.8s)]
*  You know compensation button and I pressed it to see like what are the options and it just said 200 euros [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  Nothing else like that's I think that they have [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  On the flight there's a bunch of stewards and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  Then there's a head purser there that's like the head of all the flight attendants [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=624.64s)]
*  Especially on the European flights. So that's the one you want to be talking to I don't know. Maybe she was that one but [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=629.5200000000001s)]
*  But basically I I got 200 euros in my [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=636.84s)]
*  Oh [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=645.4000000000001s)]
*  They might have better they might have better. You're probably is better consumer protections in America [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=646.84s)]
*  I [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=652.42s)]
*  Do need Austin but unfortunately, I'm here [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=656.74s)]
*  Yeah, I brought I brought Marat instead of Austin [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=660.98s)]
*  Which you guys can hear clearly because there's no fucking noise gate on my mic because the last time I had this last time [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=663.8s)]
*  I I used the setup. I actually turned off the noise gate so we could hear all of my guests and [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=669.78s)]
*  That was a mistake because now I need a noise gate because it's just me for the most part [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=676.18s)]
*  And I can't even switch the noise gate back on because the road caster application is not working [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=682.3s)]
*  At least the road caster road X is working though. So that's good because they [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=688.42s)]
*  Road casters the application road X is the name of the hardware [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=694.42s)]
*  and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=700.74s)]
*  The application is not working [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=701.78s)]
*  Marshall's here man to pull it out of his [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=704.74s)]
*  Okay, shut up. Yeah road. Let me let me google this maybe I can find and troubleshoot it road X [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=707.6999999999999s)]
*  Road X software not connecting. What is this? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=715.8199999999999s)]
*  Road streamer X how to actually fix it [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=721.3s)]
*  Best device for streamers solo content creators and anyone who wants to enhance the quality of video conference by connecting a good camera and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=725.14s)]
*  Microphone to a compact device and guess what it has zero real competitors [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=732.86s)]
*  Especially when you consider the price point and for a high quality filter building customizable sound pads for triggering effects [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=737.3399999999999s)]
*  Or latency monitoring. Okay. Okay. Okay, really game changer for content quality [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=745.74s)]
*  I tried the fuck the device actually fix and guess what? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=750.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm not alone if you check roads support side their main solution is pretty basic [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=754.38s)]
*  Just use the included cable and connect directly to your computer avoid any haps. So I tried everything they suggested [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=760.3s)]
*  I used original road cable [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=767.5s)]
*  Connected directly to my laptop avoid any haps [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=769.8199999999999s)]
*  Nothing worked. What's that? I was ready to pack it up and back to my old setup [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=773.5s)]
*  But then I tried something completely counterintuitive. I found the old usb hub collect [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=777.74s)]
*  The fucking room is on an auto timer for lights bro. Can you go turn it on? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=783.9s)]
*  I don't know why it does this like I don't know how to i'm gonna die bro [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=789.1s)]
*  Like it's so it is actually pretty crazy that the the room will nope [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=794.14s)]
*  No, no turn those on turn. No go hit the master [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=799.1800000000001s)]
*  Wait, it's on but it's flickering for some reason. Oh, it's good now [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=803.9s)]
*  Okay, no, it's not one of those rooms where you got to put the room key in because I I literally don't there's no place [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=809.26s)]
*  To put the room key in what the fuck? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=814.94s)]
*  Well, one of the light bulbs went out. Oh, it's back on [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=818.62s)]
*  Okay. Oh, it's gone again. What is happening bro? What is going on? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=822.86s)]
*  Bro, this is an old ass building. It's haunted. They didn't want to tell you [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=827.6600000000001s)]
*  But that's why I got the room upgrade. That's annoying. Okay [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=832.0600000000001s)]
*  My theory is that road caster is not really the software for this looking dust on my drover and I tried this one [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=835.26s)]
*  So here what I did [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=839.9s)]
*  I took the standard usb c to usb a cable that comes with a device [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=841.5s)]
*  Plugged a basic usb hub into my laptop connected the road streamer x through this hub [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=845.58s)]
*  And something magical happened everything started working perfectly no disconnections. No dropped frames instant recognition every single time [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=851.02s)]
*  But wait, it's getting better. I want to try something even simpler. I tested a tiny usb a to usb c adapter [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=858.94s)]
*  You know those small dongles that costs like two dollars. Guess what? It works just well [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=864.7800000000001s)]
*  What's really interesting is that after this fix the devices recognized instantly nothing disconnects randomly [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=871.18s)]
*  No frame drops all features work [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=877.98s)]
*  Everything is plugged in [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=883.34s)]
*  It's powered appropriately. It does have power cycle issues [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=885.42s)]
*  Where if you don't actually power the thing [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=889.74s)]
*  with a direct [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=893.02s)]
*  connected power [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=894.78s)]
*  It will I mean if you if you don't plug it into the wall, basically it'll it'll have issues because like the usb [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=896.7s)]
*  The specialty cable that they give you i've a usb c to usb c cable. I have it [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=902.22s)]
*  It literally doesn't work when it chooses not to yeah [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=906.7s)]
*  That I have this thing. It sucks fucking dick. Yeah, I mean I have a road caster pro too [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=910.38s)]
*  At home, but this is really good for help with the size like it's it's incredibly compact [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=915.98s)]
*  I run my I run my video through it. I run my audio through it [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=921.26s)]
*  The only issue that I have right now with it is that unfortunately it's just not [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=925.42s)]
*  the the application is not recognizing it and because there's no dials on it with the exception of like [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=930.78s)]
*  lowering the gain because there's no dials on it [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=938.62s)]
*  there's no way to [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=942.6999999999999s)]
*  uh, there's there's no way to tweak the uh, there's no way to tweak the the noise gate [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=944.22s)]
*  Yeah, and like you said I already restarted my computer shut up and i'm not gonna restart my computer right now chatter [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=949.66s)]
*  What the hell's wrong with you? You used to have to carry a go xlr and a capture card and uh your microphone's falling [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=954.78s)]
*  like and a bunch of cloud amps and a bunch of random shit and like this is [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=961.42s)]
*  Way more efficient your microphone, dude [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=965.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look it's not the best what? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=968.62s)]
*  I know how to do it brother. God damn it is what it is [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=973.5799999999999s)]
*  Have you tried asking grok? No, I have not tried asking grok different usb port might no [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=977.74s)]
*  I've tried both of the usb c ports that are readily available [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=982.62s)]
*  At least one of the usb ports should always [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=986.3s)]
*  At least one of the usb ports should always be on should be always on. What do you mean? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=989.3399999999999s)]
*  Uh, like when you turn off your computer it still supplies power to it, but that's irrelevant to your problem [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=994.06s)]
*  Yeah, anyway ask grok bro. I'm gonna ask grok. It's the fucking twitter ai chatters. They're trying to piss me off [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=998.54s)]

*  That's the problem and mouth noises that's it like this [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCDvz72uIE&t=1009.74s)]
