# Trump's Message And A Challenging Reality | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo)
*  Donald Trump said these things, arrest me officer, but I feel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=0.0s)]
*  like this is I, I can't be certain, but it kind of is [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  giving AI. Now, the reason why I say that is because Donald [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=8.8s)]
*  Trump is rarely ever coherent. He's never he's never on note [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=14.44s)]
*  like that. Trump video. What a way to what a way to bring in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=20.12s)]
*  the new year dude with Donald with Donald Trump. We can now [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=28.84s)]
*  project the winner of the presidential race. Donald Trump [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=33.2s)]
*  wins the presidency. What started off as unlikely, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=36.04s)]
*  impossible is now reality. I will fight for you with every [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=40.08s)]
*  breath in my body. And I will never ever let you down. We have [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=45.36s)]
*  a president who actually fulfilled the promises he made [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=52.2s)]
*  during the campaign securing the border to foreign policy now has [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=55.2s)]
*  a record as president is pretty impressive breaking news out of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=57.92s)]
*  home. The FBI has executed an unprecedented search warrant at [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=61.56s)]
*  President Donald Trump. President has both sides of the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=65.12s)]
*  political aisle. It's dangerous and unstable low end in American [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=69.0s)]
*  history. The Justice Department has just indicted former [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=73.36s)]
*  President Donald Trump seven years they hated him. They [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  targeted him. They hunted him down. They killed him on it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=79.44s)]
*  They tried to kill him. This is the epitome of the abuse of the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=83.92s)]
*  prosecutorial power to preempt political decisions. I never [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=87.04s)]
*  thought anything like this could happen in America. The only crime [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=90.4s)]
*  that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  those who seek to destroy it. The more that a broken system [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=99.2s)]
*  tells you that you're wrong, the more certain you should be that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  you must keep pushing. They want I don't think Donald Trump said [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=106.76s)]
*  these things arrest me officer but I feel like this is I I'm [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=111.28s)]
*  I can't be certain but it kinda is giving AI. Now the reason why [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=117.28s)]
*  I say that is because Donald Trump is rarely ever coherent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=122.2s)]
*  He's never he's never on note like that. Either he went back [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=128.28s)]
*  in either he went back in and taped it which is unlikely and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=132.44s)]
*  shocking. Okay. Or they tried to patch together some of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=137.84s)]
*  things that he has said or the third thing. I want to take [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  away my freedom because I will never let them take away your [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=145.88s)]
*  freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=149.16s)]
*  silence you. They're not coming after me. They're coming after [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  you and I just happen to be standing in their way and I will [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=156.96s)]
*  never be moving on November 5 2024. Justice will be done. We [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=160.36s)]
*  will take back our country and we will make America great again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=166.72s)]
*  America will always rise to every challenge and overcome [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=172.68s)]
*  every danger. Donald Trump seems to always get stronger when [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=176.6s)]
*  challenged. These types of things I think give him [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=181.44s)]
*  strength. When I'm reelected I will totally reiterate the deep [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=184.2s)]
*  state. As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=188.16s)]
*  convictions and faith in our God then we will not fail. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=192.16s)]
*  Upon thought let me clarify the difference between political and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=199.44s)]
*  deep commos politics. I have to get hard to carry in the new [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=201.44s)]
*  year. It's going to get a bit heavy. It's going to get really [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  bad. I think it's going to be bad. It's going to be hard. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=205.56s)]
*  That's why I said you just have to focus on things that are [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=209.76s)]
*  within your control. Okay. Things that are within your [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=213.96s)]
*  control. Things that you can change like working out, getting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=216.72s)]
*  physically fit, accomplishing goals that you set out for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=222.72s)]
*  yourself because and this isn't to say like tune out of politics [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=225.4s)]
*  at all. That's not what I'm saying. But I'm simply stating [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=229.6s)]
*  that you have to be healthy for what is to come next. Okay. And [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I just don't know what is going to happen. I don't [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=237.16s)]
*  feel like things are going to be good. We are getting [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=241.2s)]
*  progressively dumber as a society. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WMEStgBHZo&t=245.2s)]
