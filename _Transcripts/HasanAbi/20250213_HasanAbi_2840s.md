# Trump Holds Press Conference In The Oval Office | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc)
*  I won't tell you what I will do, but I'll finish it. You know what I mean? Like that's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=0.0s)]
*  classic Trump, just like, you know, giving federal recognition to a native American tribe [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=6.68s)]
*  and then permanently locking them as Trump supporters. Like that one specific tribe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=13.72s)]
*  It's always, he does this stuff all the time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=19.16s)]
*  By the way, Donald Trump is holding a press conference and we're going to get into that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=27.56s)]
*  after I blast off or rather I'm going to get into it right now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=30.88s)]
*  A country in Russia's position could allow them just in their position could allow them [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=36.56s)]
*  to join NATO. So let's do it. And long before President, the Tumasiya Senate playlist was [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=42.44s)]
*  very strong on the fact that I believe that's the reason the started because Biden went [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  out and said that they could join NATO and he shouldn't have said that. As soon as he [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  said that, I said, you know what? Weirdly enough, maybe maybe Trump will save him, Ron [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=56.36s)]
*  Khan. Who knows? It would have never happened if I were president. I think Biden is incompetent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=60.24s)]
*  And I think when he said that they could join NATO, I thought that was a very stupid thing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=67.92s)]
*  to say. I thought when he said, well, it depends if it's a minor incursion. In other words, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=73.8s)]
*  it's okay if Russia does a minor incursion. I thought that was a very foolish thing to say. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  The other thing that got it started was how badly Milley and these [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=86.32s)]
*  why would Trump of all people save him Ron Khan? Cause he's a base. He's a base. Third [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  world is dude is going to pull out, but we were pulling out with dignity and strength [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=97.28s)]
*  and we were going to take our equipment with us and everything else. They are don't joke [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  about that. Pakistan, the Americans voted for Trump because they believe he will release him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=107.28s)]
*  Wait, really? That mess. And he said, wow, this is a great time. I'm going to go in. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=110.72s)]
*  Oh no. What the Americans said, I'm not blaming Americans, but I will say what they said had a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=115.12s)]
*  big influence on his deciding to go in. Yeah. The most Latin American president of our time. Oh, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=121.04s)]
*  one hundred P. I just don't think that Donald Trump does things that are like inherently [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=125.76s)]
*  the diametrical. Not true at all. Most young Pakistanis in my community didn't vote because of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=136.56s)]
*  Gaza because of the tariffs. They have the highest tariffs just about in the world and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=142.0s)]
*  it's a hard place to do business. I would imagine he met. Let me blast off real quick. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=148.16s)]
*  You know, he's running a company. He's, uh, he's doing this as a, as something that he's felt [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=152.72s)]
*  strongly about for a long time because he sees what's happening and he sees how the country is [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=159.12s)]
*  really being hurt badly by all of the fraud, waste and abuse. Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=163.52s)]
*  How do you know whether he's meeting with the CEO or meeting with a representative of your government? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=167.84s)]
*  Well, he's meeting with me in a little while, so I'm going to ask him that question. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=173.92s)]
*  All right. I'll ask him that question. Yeah. What should we expect? What are you thinking about? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  I think orders are coming soon. I think they're all coming more or less at the same time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=186.64s)]
*  and it's not going to be a big shock to the system. But what it's going to do is it's going [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=191.12s)]
*  to bring pharmaceuticals back to our country. Much more important than the money. It's a lot [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=194.88s)]
*  of money, but it's going to bring pharmaceuticals back to our country. It's going to bring [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  chips back to our country. Remember to end Turkish hate. We will never end Turkish hate. Turkish [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=203.6s)]
*  hate will always be. Turkish hate will always thrive in this country. Okay. Here during the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  campaign, they were going to build the largest, blasting off, ladies and gentlemen, let the people [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=214.64s)]
*  know we're alive. We're alive. Let them tell them to get in here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=219.28s)]
*  When they heard me make that statement and they thought I was going to win the election, actually, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=223.52s)]
*  it was a few months before the election. Pakistani Americans thinking Donald Trump would free Imran [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=227.04s)]
*  Khan is so perfectly in line with the way that Donald Trump operates, where he probably sent [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=231.84s)]
*  out feelers to the Pakistani community somehow and signaled that he would do that. Okay. So every [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=239.12s)]
*  old Pakistani American immediately locked onto it. Okay. It's no different than him going to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=246.64s)]
*  Dearborn and being like, I'm going to finish it. I'm going to finish the Gaza stuff. I won't tell [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  you what I will do, but I'll finish it. You know what I mean? Like that's, that's classic Trump, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  just like, you know, giving federal recognition to a native American tribe and then permanently [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=266.96s)]
*  locking them as Trump supporters. Like that one specific tribe. It's always, he does the stuff all [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=273.28s)]
*  the time. To me, it's, it's the most beautiful. And I'll tell you what I think really, there's two [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  words, reciprocal, reciprocal makes tariffs really fair. Yeah. Reciprocal tariffs. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=284.08s)]
*  Any exemptions though, because you don't need to with reciprocal. You don't need to. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=294.08s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=299.2s)]
*  Yeah, we have a lot of people. Well, I have 90 days from about two weeks ago, right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm sure it can be extended, but let's see. I don't think you'll need to. We have a lot of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=312.72s)]
*  people interested in TikTok and I hope to be able to make a deal. I think it would be good. You know, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=316.08s)]
*  people have learned it's very popular and we'll have to probably get approval from China to do it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=323.92s)]
*  But we have a lot of people that are interested in a lot of people. I think China will be [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=330.88s)]
*  interested because it's to their benefit too. So I look forward to that, but we have a lot of people [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  that are interested in TikTok. Quite a few. Super popular. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  Some workers arrived today, Gavin Klager and others arrived today at the IRS. Do you expect to close [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  the IRS or what are you expecting? No, I don't expect it. But I think that the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=349.52s)]
*  Internal Revenue Service will be looked at like everybody else. Just about everybody's going to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  be looked at. So it's they're doing a hell of a job. It's an amazing job they're doing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  And you know that force is building these, I call it the force of super geniuses, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  but it's building and you know, they go up and they talk to some of the people about certain deals [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=372.08s)]
*  and the people get all tongue-tied. They can't talk because these people get it. They're very [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=376.4s)]
*  smart people. We need smart people. Yes. Brian? On tariffs, sir. Yes, sir. Mr. President, I know [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=380.96s)]
*  that during the campaign it was huge in Pennsylvania as far as bringing back manufacturing. Have you [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=387.84s)]
*  talked to any CEOs since the tariffs were announced on steel and aluminum? What's the feedback? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  They are in love with it. As you know, in Pennsylvania, U.S. Steel is through the roof. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=398.08s)]
*  They're all through the roof. That's why I didn't want U.S. Steel to make a deal with [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=402.8s)]
*  Japan or anybody else. I think it's going to do great. But I think maybe more than anybody else, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=406.32s)]
*  the steel companies and aluminum companies, they're in love with what's happened. And [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=412.88s)]
*  this will eventually be the car companies and chip companies. We have to have chips made in [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=416.8s)]
*  this country. Right now, everything's made in Taiwan practically. Almost all of it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=421.92s)]
*  Still takes us to Japan, Pog. But everything, almost all of it is made in Taiwan. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=426.48s)]
*  And we want it to be made. We want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect. You [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=431.6s)]
*  know, they took the business away. Taiwan took our chip business away. We had Intel. We had these [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=435.84s)]
*  great companies that did so well. And it was taken from us. And we want that business back. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=442.0s)]
*  We want it back in the United States. And if they don't bring it back, we're not going to be very [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=448.64s)]
*  happy. And you mentioned pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals as well. And China, that's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=453.12s)]
*  national security to bring that back. China and other places, we want to get the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=457.76s)]
*  pharmaceutical and drug business back into the United States, where it should be. Right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=462.8s)]
*  Sir, on tariffs, are you concerned that the countries that would be most affected, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=467.68s)]
*  like India, would just shift their trading to China? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  No, I'm not concerned about anything, really. I mean, I'm just doing what's fair. This is a very [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=475.36s)]
*  fair thing. This should have been done a long time ago. I would have done it, but then COVID hit. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  I was getting ready to do this years ago. And first time, we had the most successful [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=484.64s)]
*  economy in history. And then COVID hit. And I was — this was going to be the thing that I was most [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=489.36s)]
*  waiting to do. But it was awfully hard to do this with Italy and France and Spain and these — all [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=496.0s)]
*  those people were dying. And then we put tariffs on. I have a big heart. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=502.24s)]
*  Sir, on Ukraine, when Putin says that he really wants peace, do you believe him? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I believe he wants peace. I believe that President Putin, when I spoke to him yesterday, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=513.6s)]
*  I mean, I know him very well. Yeah, I think he wants peace. I think he would tell me if he didn't. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  I think I'd like to see peace. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=524.0s)]
*  Do you trust President Putin? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=526.72s)]
*  I believe that — yeah, I believe that he would like to see something happen. I trust him on this [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  subject. I think he'd like to see something happen. I think it could have happened a long [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=533.2s)]
*  time ago. I think Biden — number one, it shouldn't have started, but it did. And now [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=538.08s)]
*  all those cities are knocked down, like demolition sites. All those beautiful golden [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=543.04s)]
*  towers are knocked down. There's nothing going to replace them. But much more importantly, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=549.12s)]
*  you lost millions of people — a lot of soldiers — but you lost millions of people. When they [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=552.88s)]
*  knocked down those cities and they're all laying down on the side, they're lying down just [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=557.52s)]
*  in ashes and all crumbled up concrete, they literally look like a world-class demolition site. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=563.04s)]
*  And many of them — almost all of them, but many of them — and this should have been done by Biden [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=570.96s)]
*  years ago. This should have never been allowed to happen. I know he's a friend of yours. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=577.52s)]
*  But couldn't Putin just withdraw on his friends today? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  He's a friend of CNN. That's why nobody watches CNN anymore, because they have no [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=582.48s)]
*  credibility. Okay, who else? Yes, please. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  John, sir, you can find a buyer in the United States for TikTok. Do you think Xi Jinping will [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=588.88s)]
*  authorize the sale of it or will it not? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=592.72s)]
*  I'm going to make it worthwhile for China to do it. I think so. I mean, I got to know TikTok [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  because during the election, I ended up with 36 percent higher than my opponent with youth. Okay? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=599.04s)]
*  That never happened before. You know, there's always been a Democrat thing, youth. It became [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=608.0s)]
*  a Trump thing. And I think TikTok — I think Joe Rogan was a part of it. Some of the great people [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=612.88s)]
*  that I did interviews with were a part of it. But I think that TikTok was a — [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  TikTok! [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  I think it was a big part. Look, as you know, we were up by 36 percent with youth. The Republican [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=625.76s)]
*  was never up with youth. And I focused on TikTok, and I found it to be amazing, actually, and very [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=630.4s)]
*  fair. And I think the image of TikTok is different than it was before the election. I think people [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=636.48s)]
*  saw it and they view it as a positive, not a negative. I think it'll be — [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=641.92s)]
*  No one saw it as a negative, dog. That was just — [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=645.92s)]
*  That was not a thing. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=649.68s)]
*  What do you think you'll raise from tariffs on an annual basis? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=650.56s)]
*  That's the most interesting question. I think it'll be a staggering amount. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=653.68s)]
*  He keeps saying that when he literally lost the youth vote? Yeah, he's just simply — he's wrong, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  of course. He didn't win the youth vote by 36 percent. He got 36 percent of the youth vote, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  if I'm not mistaken. And that is a significantly larger percentage of the youth vote than he had [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=671.04s)]
*  gotten prior. He still lost the youth vote, but there is a significant number of Gen Z voters that [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=678.0s)]
*  voted for Donald Trump. It's true. It's a dangerous trend line if you are worried about Republicans [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=686.24s)]
*  winning elections, for sure. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=693.6s)]
*  Some important things. Space Force, the biggest tax cuts in history. This could be one of the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=695.28s)]
*  most important things that we've ever seen. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=700.08s)]
*  I mean, there are very few things that Donald Trump says that are correct. Or, I guess, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=701.6s)]
*  sometimes he will say the truth. Oftentimes, he'll say the truth when it's like something that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=707.6s)]
*  people get very mad about. But it's just like American foreign policy, where he'll be like, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=712.96s)]
*  yeah, you know, we're going to do ethnic cleansing and it's going to be awesome. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=718.32s)]
*  That is just American foreign policy. That's been the American foreign policy. He just says [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=722.16s)]
*  the quiet part out loud. But outside of that, he rarely ever says the truth. Oh, he got 46 percent [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  of the youth vote, which is up 36 percent up from what he got in 2020. OK, thank you. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=732.4s)]
*  I got the numbers wrong. I mean, he did not get he did not get the majority of the youth vote. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=738.0s)]
*  So why exactly can't he stop the war now? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=746.96s)]
*  It feels weird to blame Biden for something happening under Trump's watch. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  It's very possible that if that was the G8, you wouldn't have had the problem with Ukraine. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=751.76s)]
*  And if I was president, you definitely wouldn't have had the problem with Ukraine. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=756.32s)]
*  Russia would have never attacked Ukraine. But you ask a very good question. The G8 [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=759.52s)]
*  used to be the G8 and then these people. No, he didn't get out. And I was he didn't go from 10 [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=764.2399999999999s)]
*  percent to 46 percent. Hold on. I'll look it up. I'll look up the numbers in a second. OK, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=769.52s)]
*  hold on. We'll we'll get to that in a moment. Prime Minister Abe, a great man from Japan, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=773.68s)]
*  agreed with me 100 percent. And so today I'm going to be I'm going to be covering Trump's [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=778.4s)]
*  favor abilities anyway. They will get to that. I think it would have been very helpful and it [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  still would be helpful to have Russia be a part of that mix. And I think if they were, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=788.56s)]
*  I don't think you would have had the problem that you have right now. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=793.92s)]
*  Russia is part of the G20. They kicked them out, of course, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=796.2399999999999s)]
*  because they illegally annexed Crimea. I mean, how would you have responded if Russia invaded or [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=799.04s)]
*  took over? They took Crimea during Obama. They took they took. Now they're looking to take the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  whole thing. Then they took a big chunk of land and people, as you know, during Bush. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=813.2s)]
*  And now they're trying to take the whole thing during Biden. During Bush. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  Is he talking about like Georgia or something? I took anything with Trump. Nothing. Not two [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=823.5200000000001s)]
*  inches of property of of land. But Crimea was Obama. And then Bush gave him a lot. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=827.5200000000001s)]
*  You remember. And then, in fact, it's just sort of a standard little phrase. And Biden's giving [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  him everything because this is a war that shouldn't have been had. And the only one that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=841.68s)]
*  didn't give him anything is Trump. This is the way it is. What's your message to Wall Street [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  about these tariffs? There's been some nervousness on Wall Street about the impact. I think it hasn't [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=850.4799999999999s)]
*  been very much. Georgia. Georgia was in Obama as well. Georgia was during Obama as well, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=854.3199999999999s)]
*  but it was due to George W. Bush. I think he just got that wrong. Other countries want to have a [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=859.28s)]
*  strong United States, they want to have a strong America. And I think it's going to make us very, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  very strong, much stronger. And we have a lot of work we're doing on the military, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=869.84s)]
*  our military already. I've authorized some contracts to be built that are very substantial. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=876.1600000000001s)]
*  We're building the greatest equipment in the world. We have the greatest military equipment [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  in the world. We're building it at some point. Georgia was summer of 2008. I was in D.C. that [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=884.96s)]
*  summer. And I'm going to meet with Russia in particular, those two. And I'm going to say [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=890.08s)]
*  there's no reason for us to be spending almost a trillion dollars on military. There's no. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=894.0s)]
*  Georgia was at the end of Bush's second term. $400 billion. China is going to be at $400 billion. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=899.04s)]
*  We're at a trillion. We're going to be at close to a trillion. And I'm going to say we can settle [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=905.04s)]
*  this so we can spend this on other things. We don't have to spend this on military because. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=910.7199999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to be meeting with China. You know, we were trying to deescalate nuclear. And I was [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=915.8399999999999s)]
*  in a position where Russia had agreed and China had agreed we were going to start. And then we [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=921.68s)]
*  had a rigged election. So that never took place. But this one was too big to rig. We won by so much [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=926.0s)]
*  that it was too big to rig. Would you be in a China meeting in the United States or would you travel to China? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=931.04s)]
*  For what? A China meeting. I tell people all the time, you know, the question is who's going to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=935.68s)]
*  have the first meeting? Where are you going to? I say this to Putin, to President Xi. I say to everybody, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=941.28s)]
*  never bothered me. You know, I'm willing to say I'll go first. It doesn't matter. It's the end result [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=949.92s)]
*  that counts. So it doesn't make any difference. When do you want to have a conversation about [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=955.04s)]
*  global defense spending? You, China, Russia? Well, I'd like to have that as soon as things settle down. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=959.36s)]
*  I'm going to have that conference primarily with China and Russia because those are the two that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=964.0s)]
*  that really are out there. And we're going to have them spend a lot less money. We're going to spend [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=968.24s)]
*  a lot less money. And I know they're going to do it. They agreed to it. We were talking about [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=973.52s)]
*  denuking, denuclearized, denuking. And President Putin and I agreed that we were going to do it in [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=978.96s)]
*  a very big way. There's no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons. We already have [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  so many you could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=992.48s)]
*  nuclear weapons and they're building nuclear weapons and China's building new nuclear weapons [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=999.6s)]
*  and China's trying to catch up because, you know, they're very substantially behind. But [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1004.4s)]
*  within five or six years, they'll be even. And we're all spending a lot of money that we could [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive. Hopefully, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  there'll never be a time when we need those weapons. If there's ever a time when we need [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  nuclear weapons, like the kind of weapons that we're building and that Russia has and that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1025.36s)]
*  China has to a lesser extent, but will have, that's going to be a very sad day. That's going [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1030.0s)]
*  to be probably oblivion. Do you see that in separate conversations or do you see one giant [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1035.76s)]
*  summit with you, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin? Yeah, I could see that. Let things calm down a [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1040.32s)]
*  little bit. You know, when I left, we had no Middle East problem. We had no Russia going into [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1045.28s)]
*  Ukraine. They never would have done it. Putin never would have done it. And I came back and we [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1049.92s)]
*  got like the whole world is blowing up. So when we straighten it all out, then I want to have one [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1054.8s)]
*  of the with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia. And I want to say let's cut our [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1061.2s)]
*  military budget in half. And we can do that. Remember when you said the homeland are [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  Gulf of America thing was being overblown? Yeah, I mean, they're petty as fuck. This doesn't change [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1074.0s)]
*  what I'm saying. That's spending as well. What are you talking about? Waste? This is what they're [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1078.56s)]
*  doing with that. But it's overblown in terms of like, it's not that significant of a difference. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1083.92s)]
*  It's just like a silly aesthetic thing that they did. China Russia, the G 20. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1091.44s)]
*  I know it's the people. It's President Putin, President Xi. I don't need bodies. I don't need [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1096.16s)]
*  anything. It's people. It's all about people. It's about relationship and people. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1100.8000000000002s)]
*  And you know, I've had a good relationship with President Putin. I've had a good relationship [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1105.8400000000001s)]
*  with President Xi. It's about people. And I think when things straighten out, which I hope will be [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1110.0s)]
*  in the not too distant future, the meeting I want to have first is a meeting with China and a meeting [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1116.88s)]
*  with Russia on slowing down, stopping and reducing nuclear weapons in particular. And also on not [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1122.16s)]
*  having to spend the kind of money we're all spending on weapons, military weapons generally. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1132.24s)]
*  I think my question is, would you have those meetings separately with each of those leaders? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1137.2s)]
*  Or would you try to bring them all together? You start off separately and that's what was happening. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1141.28s)]
*  I was dealing with President Putin. We had really an understanding where we were going to [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1146.8s)]
*  denuclearize. What a beautiful term that is, right? Denuclearize. What a great thing if we [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1151.44s)]
*  could do that. And we were going to, he really like a denuclearization agreement would literally [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1156.4s)]
*  make Donald Trump the greatest peacekeeper of all time. It's of course not going to happen. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1162.8s)]
*  And the idea that it would ever happen is pure fantasy, but he would absolutely be worthy of [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1170.48s)]
*  every Nobel Peace Prize going forward. If that institution actually truly gave peace prizes to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1180.48s)]
*  people who were peacekeepers in general. Okay. It's going to go well. You know, the United States [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1187.76s)]
*  is going to become a very, very strong economic. Can you imagine Donald Trump facilitates the [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1194.0800000000002s)]
*  denuclearization of the entire planet? Oh yes. The same way you said Russia would not invade Ukraine. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1199.04s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Yeah. I like that. I like that you guys can only harp on one note over and over again. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1207.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I mean. Yes. I wonder why you can't point to any other things aside from that [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1217.8400000000001s)]
*  because it's always wrong regardless of how much you fucking cry about it at the time. I hope I'm [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1224.96s)]
*  wrong. I just don't think that, you know, Donald Trump will ever denuclearize the United States of [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1232.0800000000002s)]
*  America. Biden in particular, I guess he said that, Oh, they have us over a barrel. They don't have [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1236.96s)]
*  us over a barrel. We have them over a barrel. A world without nukes would be much more dangerous. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1243.28s)]
*  Those countries won't trade with us. We won't trade with- [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1247.44s)]
*  What are you, what are you saying? A world without all nukes? What do you mean? What, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1250.8799999999999s)]
*  what is happening? No, objectively, not having world ending weapons would be a good thing. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1258.32s)]
*  Okay. What, what? Mitch McConnell has now voted against several of your nominees. He voted against [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1267.52s)]
*  RFK junior as the next health secretary, citing conspiracy theories. He's kind of right away. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1273.28s)]
*  Stop, stop, stop, stop hitting the mutually assured destruction. We're talking about [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1278.08s)]
*  the evisceration of all nukes. Okay. It is pure fantasy regardless, but you're out of your mind. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1283.12s)]
*  No, stop talking about mutually assured destruction being the only way to keep peace in the world. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1290.32s)]
*  And that is what is like kept the world safe or whatever. Look at Ukraine. Look at Ukraine. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1295.28s)]
*  Please understand. Look at Ukraine. Russia has nukes. America has nukes. There's a reason why [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1303.68s)]
*  Russia and America never actually engage in straight battle. Okay. What's the difference [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1311.36s)]
*  for the people of Ukraine? You, you make it seem as though countries do not engage in war with one [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1315.84s)]
*  another because they're nuclear powers. Okay. That still doesn't change the dynamic of war. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1321.92s)]
*  I mean, I guess it changes the dynamic of war a little bit in terms of like countries getting into [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1327.6s)]
*  battles with one another, but the notion that without nukes, Russia and the USA would have [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1333.52s)]
*  gone to war. USA would have suffered 1 million casualties in Japan. Oh my God. Oh my God. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1338.0s)]
*  It is no, I disagree with you. I disagree with you across the board. Okay. Especially like [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1343.84s)]
*  as it stands currently, if you are a developing nation, you do have to have a nuke in order to [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  avoid American, in order to avoid American intervention, but the alternative vision [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1355.44s)]
*  for a better world would be that no one has nukes. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1362.32s)]
*  It's power and it's affected his vote. And you know, it's one of those things, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1365.4399999999998s)]
*  but in the meantime, Bobby did great, got more votes than anybody thought. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1371.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think he's going to do phenomenally, just phenomenally in that position. And everybody else [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1375.4399999999998s)]
*  likewise did well, not only well, they got more votes than anybody thought. Tulsi, look at how [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1381.52s)]
*  he doubted Mitch McConnell ever had polio. That's amazing. He's faking it. Marko got 99 votes. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1388.08s)]
*  And Marko, by the way, I have to tell you, Marco Rubio has done a fantastic job. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1395.84s)]
*  He's been a great secretary of state. They're all doing great, but we're going to have a swearing [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1400.16s)]
*  in today. And maybe we're going to have the idea, the idea, if we're discussing complete [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1406.24s)]
*  denuclearization, the idea that countries would be better off with nuclear proliferation is an [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1410.72s)]
*  inherently cynical ploy. Okay, you need to understand if the conversation is about what's [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1416.56s)]
*  currently happening, then that's a totally separate conversation to have. But if you were having, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1421.84s)]
*  if there was a serious initiative towards denuclearization and your argument is like, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1427.12s)]
*  oh no, mutually assured destruction has kept the world safe. The idea that the world has been safe [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1432.24s)]
*  during the Cold War or the idea that the world is currently safe is ridiculous. It's only safe if [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1438.1599999999999s)]
*  you are in America. It's only safe if you are in the heart of empire. If you're in the Imperial [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1444.72s)]
*  Corps, it's not safe at all for other countries. That's ridiculous. It's the notion that like, oh, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1449.44s)]
*  we don't have world wars anymore. It's like, yeah, we don't. But there is never a moment where [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1455.84s)]
*  America is not engaged in some kind of war. It's just you're sheltered from the immediate impact [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1461.84s)]
*  of such things. Yeah, you can say, oh, dude, there's like, you know, you can rewind if you want. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1469.28s)]
*  He's been taking questions for 10 minutes before he tuned in. No, it's fine. Especially because [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1478.56s)]
*  especially because nuclear proliferation being the one thing that stops global powers like [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1483.04s)]
*  superpowers from fighting one another is ridiculous because you have this cynical approach then where [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1489.04s)]
*  you automatically assume war is a constant. It is an inevitability. Nuclear deproliferation would be [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1496.08s)]
*  or denuclearization would be one very unimaginably significant point towards global peace. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1504.08s)]
*  He's not equipped mentally. Trump says a Mitch McConnell saying he never really had it. I don't [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1512.08s)]
*  know anything about he had polio. Trump says, are you doubting that he had polio? I have no idea if [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1515.9199999999998s)]
*  he had polio delusional out of touch. L.A. millionaire take that's amazing. Yes, I am a delusional [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1521.04s)]
*  out of touch L.A. millionaire. And that's why I think denuclearization is never going to happen. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1528.8799999999999s)]
*  But in theory, it would be better for the world. Oh, seven. Oh, you're going to be banned for this [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1536.0s)]
*  brave take. No, you're not. I'm not going to ban you little man. Don't worry. War is a constant. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1543.36s)]
*  We are violent by nature. Come on. OK. Yeah. You don't understand. OK. You don't understand. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1550.08s)]
*  We are always we always have to constantly engage in war with one another. Mankind has never actually [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1556.72s)]
*  engaged in the collaborative effort. Yeah. What's what's human nature? Do you think skyscrapers are [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1562.8799999999999s)]
*  human nature? Do you think space travel is inherent to human nature? None of these things are human [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1570.0s)]
*  nature. OK. It's ridiculous. Get out of here. I think explaining nukes aren't a deterrent is a [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1575.52s)]
*  hard thing to describe to people that believe it because it's tied directly to the belief that many [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1580.48s)]
*  people have had that the world runs on being selfish and rugged individualism. I know now [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1584.0s)]
*  it is a unfortunately incredibly cynical way to approach the world, especially if we're having a [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1588.0s)]
*  conversation about especially when we're having a conversation about an alternative that will never [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1594.16s)]
*  exist regardless. But we're having a conversation about an alternative vision for the future. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1599.28s)]
*  OK. We are just as collectivist minded as we are violent conquerors. Exactly. It's about [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  it's about what you choose to highlight. Trump is live again. Oh my God. He's great. Oh, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1611.3600000000001s)]
*  he's doing the RFK Junior flex now. OK. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nothing works. RFK is RFK is actually [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1617.04s)]
*  breaking the broadcast. It seems. Holy shit. What is happening? RFK is brick the broadcast. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1625.8400000000001s)]

*  Cheryl Hines is right there, too. The oath of office and officially because [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1638.8s)]
*  what is going on? Oh, they're rewinding the tape. Is there another feed? The RFK RFKs alien [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1645.2s)]
*  brain worms are breaking the broadcast. It's over. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1658.72s)]
*  Satan. I've got juniors broken containment. This is not a drill. Oh, yeah. It's over. As far as [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1669.52s)]
*  as far as like will denuclearization happen? Of course not. Don't be ridiculous. I'm not saying [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1676.32s)]
*  that it will happen. But if you're going to talk about it in theory, OK, I'm not going to sit here [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1682.08s)]
*  and tell you that countries having world ending weapons at the inside of their arsenal is a good [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1687.52s)]
*  thing. It's not. It is one of the most dangerous aspects of modern society. OK. Don't let these [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1695.2s)]
*  don't let these people turn around and lie to you and make it seem like everybody having [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1702.96s)]
*  everybody having nukes is a good thing. Restart player by closing tab and reopening it. I don't [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1709.2s)]
*  think it's the player that's busted. I think it's the broadcast that's busted chatter. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1713.68s)]
*  Everyone else is having the same issue. What is the chat saying? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1718.16s)]
*  Di Elon fix it. Someone needs to be fired over this. This take goes against the Hassan I'm a [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1723.04s)]
*  doctrine. Yes. The Hassan I'll be doctrine is a totally separate conversation. OK. If we're [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1728.48s)]
*  having a theoretical conversation about denuclearization, denuclearization, which [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1737.84s)]
*  is is if we're having a realistic conversation is never going to happen. But if we're having [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1744.3999999999999s)]
*  a theoretical conversation about the denuclearization, yes, of course, I'm in support of it. There's a [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1749.1999999999998s)]
*  difference between there's a difference between what is the reality and what is theoretically [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1753.6799999999998s)]
*  better. Oh, it's working now. Never mind. It's still not working. Thoughts on all the anti woke [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1760.6399999999999s)]
*  leftists on eggs. I don't know who the anti woke leftists are. Take the oath of office and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1766.8s)]
*  officially become our secretary of health and human services. Just as I promised last year, Bobby [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  is going to lead a great national mission to make America healthy again. And he's going to do it. I [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1779.28s)]
*  think he's going to do things that will really make us very proud of this day. Like his father, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1785.68s)]
*  Senator Robert F. Kennedy and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy. Bobby has devoted much of his [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1792.48s)]
*  life to serving his fellow Americans and his campaign for president. And he was a very tough [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1800.16s)]
*  competitor. I did not like it at all. I said, Let's get him on my side. But in his campaign for [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1805.04s)]
*  president in 2024, Bobby brought together a coalition of supporters across party lines, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1811.68s)]
*  and he really worked very hard and he got he had tremendous support, unbelievable support. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1818.48s)]
*  And I think a lot of that support came my way when we decided to do a little merger. And [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1823.8400000000001s)]
*  it was really great. And it was very loyal, very loyal, incredible people. They believe in him so [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1831.76s)]
*  strongly because he's a fierce advocate for the health of our Children and for the values of free [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1836.64s)]
*  speech, democracy and peace. And people are going to be very impressed. I have no doubt. I've known [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1842.64s)]
*  him a long time. It's been a friend of mine a long time. Perhaps most importantly, though, Bobby [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  created a nationwide movement made up of millions and millions of mothers and fathers and young [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1854.24s)]
*  people and concerned citizen of every background who want to end and this this horrible chronic [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1859.44s)]
*  disease crisis that exists exists in America. He's absolutely committed to getting dangerous [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1866.24s)]
*  chemicals out of our environment and out of our food supply and getting the American people the [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1872.8000000000002s)]
*  facts and the answers that we deserve. After years in which our public health system has [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1878.16s)]
*  squandered the trust of our citizens, and they really have, they didn't. They don't trust us. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1883.92s)]
*  They don't trust anybody. Frankly, they've gone through hell. There's no better person to lead [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1888.5600000000002s)]
*  our campaign of historic reforms and restore faith in American health care. Bobby's going to do it. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1894.08s)]
*  The United States spends more money and health than any other country on earth, but we're growing [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1900.88s)]
*  sicker every year. We're not as healthy as countries that spend just a fraction of what we spend. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1906.08s)]
*  So there's something wrong. He's going to figure it out. In recent decades, we've seen staggering [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1911.28s)]
*  increases in cancer rates across all age demographics, including more than 40% increase [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1916.24s)]
*  in childhood cancer since 1975. Who can believe that? And an explosion in other chronic childhood [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1922.96s)]
*  illnesses. Not long ago, one in 10,000 people, children, had autism. Now it's one in 36. Think [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1929.92s)]
*  of that. One in 10,000. One in 10,000. Now it's one in 36. Who can believe that? There's something [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1937.76s)]
*  wrong. There's something wrong. And I think it's something that can be found out. In 2022, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1948.32s)]
*  more than 40% of children had at least one chronic health condition. And today, nearly 80% of young [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1954.8799999999999s)]
*  adults do not qualify for military service, in large part for health reasons. Think of that. 80%. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1961.4399999999998s)]
*  Something is wrong. And that's why immediately after Bobby is sworn in, I get a voter establishing [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1971.52s)]
*  the President's Commission to Make America Healthy Again. We have some great people on that [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1976.88s)]
*  commission. Chaired by our new secretary, this groundbreaking commission will be charged with [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1981.44s)]
*  investigating what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic illness, reporting its [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1988.24s)]
*  findings, and delivering an action plan to the American people. And it's going to be a plan that [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1993.68s)]
*  people are really waiting to hear. Bobby, I want to thank you. You've gone through a lot. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=1999.1200000000001s)]
*  It's taken great courage. You've been amazing, actually. And I said, you're going to be okay. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2004.6399999999999s)]
*  And I said, I know. I've been supported amazingly by Cheryl and his family. And it was very tough. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2009.6799999999998s)]
*  It was a very nasty group of people that were after him. But he was tougher and smarter than [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2019.6s)]
*  they are. That's why he's been so good. He understood the assault, but he was able to. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2025.84s)]
*  So I just want to congratulate you. And we have a very special person here to swear you and a very [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2033.68s)]
*  man that I think has done just a, I think he's just an amazing man. It's also the same reason why [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2041.6000000000001s)]
*  it's mostly prominent in boys in general, or at least initially from the 90s onward, it was mostly [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2047.8400000000001s)]
*  prominent, seemingly only increased in boys. Why did it increase in women? Perhaps it has something [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2054.88s)]
*  to do with the social dynamic of, of a lot of the, the social conditioning that women go through, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2060.96s)]
*  young girls go through that make it harder to diagnose autism in women. Maybe that's the reason [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2068.16s)]
*  because it's not like women are getting vaccinated at a lower rate than men. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2075.52s)]
*  You know, that's what's so stupid about it. It's because research around medical research [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2080.64s)]
*  around women is still as a direct consequence of patriarchal constructs significantly behind. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2086.64s)]
*  That's it. It's just a theory though. What do you mean? It's just a theory. What could it, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2092.96s)]
*  there is nothing that like young men are experiencing that is like significantly [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2102.24s)]
*  different than young women in terms of like vaccines. Do you think that women are just not [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2108.64s)]
*  getting vaccinated? No, most of this stuff is just the same as the left-handedness argument. Okay. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2113.44s)]
*  Whether it's being gay, whether it's like more queer people exist now in society, what's that about? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2120.56s)]
*  Or, or there's more autism in American society. What's that about? Like virtually all of that [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2126.4s)]
*  is, is almost identical to the left-handedness argument. There's just a bunch of people who were [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2133.6s)]
*  left-handed normally. Okay. And they were forced into writing and using their right hands. And once [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2139.84s)]
*  we stopped punishing people for doing that, there was a number of people that were left-handed and [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2146.6400000000003s)]
*  it just stopped after a certain percentage. Yeah. The autism spectrum disorder is a vast criteria of [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2152.1600000000003s)]
*  different kinds of neurodivergences that was put under the same umbrella and also had significantly [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2163.2799999999997s)]
*  better ways of diagnosis, especially since the nineties, which then led to a massive number of [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2172.0s)]
*  boys becoming autistic. Why are they becoming autistic? I've worked with boys with autism [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2178.96s)]
*  specifically. Okay. And I can tell you their parents were definitely autistic. The only [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2184.7999999999997s)]
*  difference was their parents were not diagnosed with autism. Okay. That's it. They just weren't [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2190.96s)]
*  diagnosed. The notion that the notion that there is a ginormous disparity. Yeah. Some might say [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2198.32s)]
*  I still work with a lot of men with autism now, but the notion that there is this gigantic disparity [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2205.04s)]
*  between men catching autism versus women catching autism immediately undermines the vaccination [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2211.04s)]
*  argument. Okay. That's it. Like a lot of your parents have some of you, some of you who are [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2219.36s)]
*  autistic have immediate family members that suspiciously have lifelike model trains. Okay. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2225.6800000000003s)]
*  They have an entire room dedicated to model trains and that doesn't even ring any alarm bells in your [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2233.28s)]
*  mind about an autism diagnosis for your uncle. Okay. Or for your dad. What the fuck do you think [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2239.36s)]
*  is going on? Yeah. That boy is autistic as hell. Okay. The only difference is he grew up in the [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2245.2s)]
*  60s, 70s, 80s where he wasn't diagnosed. Oh no. You don't understand. He's just quirky. He just [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2253.04s)]
*  quirked up. He's just got his, you know, key interests. Oh yeah. Okay. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2258.7999999999997s)]
*  He challenged at one point during his administration, he challenged Americans to do a 50 mile walk, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2275.2s)]
*  which I ultimately did. Have you ever seen a severe case of autism like non-verbal? Yes. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2282.56s)]
*  I have. And yes, the parents weren't, the parents weren't non-verbal. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2287.7599999999998s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2297.2s)]
*  My father had a, one of his best friends was Al Lowenstein. And Al Lowenstein ultimately was a congressman from New York who was an assassin. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2305.2s)]
*  Me and my wife actually got invited to do a study about genetics and autism because both of our kids are diagnosed [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2313.2s)]
*  autistic. I got pretty high on that test too. Yeah. Get rid of President Johnson and the Vietnam War. And at the time that he started it, people just thought it was a fool's errand. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2316.8799999999997s)]
*  And ultimately he asked my father to run or present against Johnson. My father wouldn't do it at that time. And he asked, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2326.3999999999996s)]
*  Gene McCarthy, McCarthy did it and he joined that campaign. And my father ultimately ran and Johnson then dropped out. So Al Lowenstein had succeeded. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2334.64s)]
*  And although Al Lowenstein was on the other side now running against my father with Gene McCarthy, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2345.2799999999997s)]
*  my father wrote him a note, a quote from Emerson where he said, if a single man [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2351.2799999999997s)]
*  lands himself firmly on his own ideal and there abide, a whole wide world will come around to him. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2357.6s)]
*  For 20 years I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2365.3599999999997s)]
*  On August 23rd of last year, God sent me President Trump. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2378.48s)]
*  And he gave me a... [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2384.56s)]
*  He's now given me, he's kept every promise that he's made to me. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2392.56s)]
*  He's kept his word in every account and gone way beyond it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2397.2s)]
*  I'm so grateful to you, Mr. President. A lot of people told me that I couldn't trust President Trump. I better get it in writing. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2401.36s)]
*  And we did a handshake and everything that he told me he was going to do, he has done. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2409.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm so grateful to him and I've told you before, I genuinely believe that you are a pivotal historical figure. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2415.2s)]
*  And you are going to transform this country at a time when we see all of the indition of democracy now in tatters in our country. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2424.72s)]
*  We see the rise of military industrial complex, the rise of totalitarianism, these attacks on our constitution and this [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2434.4s)]
*  breathtaking epidemic that is disabling our people. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2442.48s)]
*  President Trump has promised to restore the American dream in this country. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2446.0s)]
*  A healthy person has a thousand dreams, a sick person only has one. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2451.44s)]
*  60% of our population has only one dream. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2456.7200000000003s)]
*  And they get better. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2460.2400000000002s)]
*  President Trump has promised that he's going to restore America's strength. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2462.2400000000002s)]
*  But we can't be a strong nation if we have a weak system. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2466.56s)]
*  I love that this man is the beacon of health, okay? I need you to understand. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2470.48s)]
*  What you're seeing right now, this man on screen, okay? This man right here. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2475.12s)]
*  That's the beacon of health. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2481.6s)]
*  Do you understand me? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2484.32s)]
*  He's the healthiest boy that has ever existed. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2486.4s)]
*  The reason why he looks like a rotisserie chicken that has been left out for too long [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2490.32s)]
*  is part of the reason why he's so healthy. It's the drugs that he took. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2498.48s)]
*  President Trump has shown again and again that he is that hero. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2503.92s)]
*  And most recently, I greatly appreciate and I called you [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2508.56s)]
*  the day that you announced the termination of USAID. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2513.28s)]
*  My uncle started USAID [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2517.04s)]
*  in 1961 [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2520.08s)]
*  for humanitarian purposes to put our country on the side of the poor. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2522.08s)]
*  It has been captured by the military industrial complex. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2526.08s)]
*  It has become a sinister propagator of totalitarianism across and war [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2529.6s)]
*  across the globe. And very few people understand how sinister this agency really is. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2535.68s)]
*  And President Trump saw that and he stood up to it with a masterstroke. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2542.48s)]
*  And we want to do the same thing with the institutions that are stealing the health of our children. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2547.84s)]
*  We need a revolutionary figure and you are that figure. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2555.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. The revolutionary figure of Donald Trump. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2558.48s)]
*  Some of the the allies that I've had in this battle for a long time are Senator Rand Paul, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2563.92s)]

*  who've all been champions of the MAHA agenda before I even came along. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2575.6s)]
*  I'm very grateful for you for standing strong. Thank you very much, President. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2580.3999999999996s)]

*  I have a lot of secrets that have been maybe kept from us, but he's going to come up with some [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2609.68s)]
*  solutions to some big, big problems. Could you please explain why this administration is [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2614.96s)]
*  making a show going after the military industrial complex? I don't remember anything like this [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2618.72s)]
*  during the election. It seems like the Republican base won't support it. They're not. They're not. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2621.9199999999996s)]
*  I'd be shocked if they actually did. Okay, virtually everything that they've done thus far [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2626.56s)]
*  is not about undermining the American military industrial complex at all. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2632.3999999999996s)]
*  If you look at where they're making cuts, it's shit like the NIH. Okay, they're not. They're not. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2635.84s)]
*  They're not making cuts on anything. They're not making any cuts on like think about it this way, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2644.4s)]
*  chatters. They quite literally also sanctioned additional not sanctioned. They signed off on [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2650.1600000000003s)]
*  additional weapons to Israel. That was one of the first initiatives that this administration has made. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2656.56s)]
*  I can't think of something that is more wasteful in terms of spending. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2662.16s)]

*  healthcare, things of that nature, spending on veterans housing, veterans healthcare, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGDIrwD_4Pc&t=2694.2400000000002s)]
