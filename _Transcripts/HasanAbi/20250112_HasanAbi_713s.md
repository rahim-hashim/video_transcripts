# Perspective On Inmate Firefighters | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8)
*  Oh wow, I got a mention on ABC. ABC Australia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=0.0s)]
*  YouTuber and Twitch streamer Assam Pyke are known as Asanabe, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=6.7s)]
*  alongside actor and fellow streamer Caroline Kwan, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=9.8s)]
*  have been able to speak to some of the hundreds of people fighting LA's fires [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  as a part of their prison sentence. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=15.5s)]
*  The US famously uses prison as the respond to natural disasters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=17.1s)]
*  As many of you know, last night I went to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=25.1s)]
*  the Rose Bowl, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=29.099999999999998s)]
*  the staging area for a lot of the wildfire initiatives, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=31.3s)]
*  a lot of the firefighters that are, you know, staying in that area [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=36.7s)]
*  as they go in and combat these wildfires all around Los Angeles. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=41.1s)]
*  And I went and I interviewed the incarcerated wildfire firefighters, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=47.3s)]
*  Alongside Caroline Kwan, my brother Murat, and also producer March. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=55.1s)]
*  And it was fantastic. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=61.9s)]
*  It's one of the few instances where anyone has had this much real-time [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=63.0s)]
*  consistent access to these guys, these heroes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=69.3s)]
*  And it was fantastic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=73.8s)]
*  That is for the record, journalism. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=76.2s)]
*  Just so you understand. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=79.2s)]
*  That is, that's what I mean when I say sometimes I do end up doing journalism. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=80.3s)]
*  This is one of those instances, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=84.8s)]
*  But it filled my heart with, I don't know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=86.7s)]
*  I don't know what the right term is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=90.5s)]
*  Like it, I get so much fulfillment out of doing stuff like that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=92.3s)]
*  And I think you guys would too, if you were out there directly hands-on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  helping people or talking to people that are in, you know, desperate need [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=102.0s)]
*  of just a helping hand, just someone to talk to every now and then, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=107.4s)]
*  you would appreciate it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=111.7s)]
*  So you would truly, truly appreciate it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=113.2s)]
*  I think. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=115.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=116.3s)]
*  After the stream, I came back. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=116.9s)]
*  You attempted to post you on LSF last night. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=119.10000000000001s)]
*  They all got downvoted by normies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=121.3s)]
*  That's kind of crazy that there's no motion on LSF for like any positive [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=123.2s)]
*  clips of mine where like I could literally save a baby out of a burning [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  building and they would try to find something that's like clippable [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=132.9s)]
*  that makes me look bad. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=136.5s)]
*  Like it's, it's kind of shocking that there are still people who are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=137.9s)]
*  so aggressively working to do that, but it is what it is. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=141.9s)]
*  You know, having said that having said that, oh, there is one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=145.6s)]
*  There is a clip by ninjite actually. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=149.4s)]
*  So not a hater. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=152.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=153.1s)]
*  We'll take a look at that in a second. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=153.5s)]
*  Bro. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=156.2s)]
*  These red enormous ideas don't consider the prisoner firefighters [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=156.4s)]
*  a slave labor, but his volunteers so stupid. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=158.5s)]
*  No, there is listen all labor under coercive conditions under prisoner [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=160.7s)]
*  conditions are still considered effectively. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=167.0s)]
*  Theoretically. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=170.3s)]
*  Having said that, however, this is and I 100% stand by my statement [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=172.8s)]
*  that I'm going to make here and I'll talk about this more extensively [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=177.8s)]
*  in a little bit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=180.8s)]
*  This is a rehabilitative program. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  It's the closest you can get to a rehabilitative approach. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=184.5s)]
*  Okay, because it's not just the fact that these guys are going out [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=191.4s)]
*  and fighting wildfires, but they're also in a very different carceral [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  structure than the average County and prison structure. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=198.6s)]
*  Okay, so we'll do that in a second. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=202.2s)]
*  I think what is appropriate here is that these programs should also [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=205.9s)]
*  have job opportunities. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=211.2s)]
*  These programs should also involve job opportunities and more importantly [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  these programs should also have better pay. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=217.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=220.5s)]
*  If there was better pay that had some semblance of pay parity with [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=221.2s)]
*  regular wildfire firefighters, then it would not be any different than [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=226.6s)]
*  an average job. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=232.2s)]
*  That is the argument. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=233.6s)]
*  That is the argument that I make on this and I hope that you guys [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  understand that as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=239.1s)]
*  The reason why the reason why these people take on the job these [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=240.6s)]
*  treacherous conditions specifically is because they have their their [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=245.6s)]
*  terms shortened. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=251.4s)]
*  That is an element of massive coercion having said that however, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  there's much work to be done in the criminal justice system and I will [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=259.4s)]
*  get to that in a brief moment. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=262.1s)]
*  So Scott over Lolo. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=268.7s)]
*  He didn't cry at the outro. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=270.2s)]
*  Okay, don't make fun of Lolo for crying. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=271.3s)]
*  So I'll get to that in a second. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=273.9s)]
*  How was peso and the playboys? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=276.0s)]
*  I didn't I didn't know who he was, but I think one of the playboys [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=277.8s)]
*  is a Hassan Abed and he was like really stoked to see me and I didn't [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=281.7s)]
*  understand what was going on. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  I was like a little confused by it and it led to an awkward interaction. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=287.3s)]
*  But one of the biggest employers in the UK that provide programs for [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=291.0s)]
*  prisoner rehabilitation is a key cutting company. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Lolo's interview of mine came out as well. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  We'll be taking a look at that as well. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=299.2s)]
*  But yeah, I ended the broadcast last night. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=301.2s)]
*  I went to bed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  We're almost done. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=306.7s)]
*  We're almost done with Lord of the Rings extended Trilogy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=308.29999999999995s)]
*  Okay, my mom calls it a job and but I'm very proud of her for not [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=312.2s)]
*  falling asleep every time we actually watch. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=318.0s)]
*  So, you know, we did that last night. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=320.4s)]
*  I went to bed woke up in the middle of the night with some [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=322.7s)]
*  throbbing teeth pain. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=326.29999999999995s)]
*  Crack some Advils went back to sleep woke up early played some [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=329.2s)]
*  basketball played basketball for two hours. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=333.4s)]
*  Actually, I went crazy mode today. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=336.3s)]
*  Won a bunch of games lost a couple and I'm feeling pretty good. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  And don't worry before you get mad and say Hassan you are so [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=342.5s)]
*  irresponsible. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=345.6s)]
*  I checked the air quality index before I played basketball, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=346.6s)]
*  especially because of my previous experience playing basketball [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=350.8s)]
*  when the air quality index was so horrific that the air was [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=354.6s)]
*  basically radiating. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=359.6s)]
*  So I will not be making that mistake ever again. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=364.4s)]
*  How many times do your mom wake up during Lord of the Rings? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=365.4s)]
*  I think she watching Bible stories. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  No, she doesn't. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=370.4s)]
*  She she normally falls asleep on everything no matter how what [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=371.4s)]
*  the length of the show is, but she's actually been she's actually [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=374.29999999999995s)]
*  been staying up and watching it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  So I'm very proud of her today's air quality is perfect for Bellagio [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=381.4s)]
*  air quality in West Hollywood is literally like good. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=385.7s)]
*  It's like 40 anyway. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, that's it and I'm here and I'm live I'm alive and I'm [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=392.1s)]
*  very excited that we got to do. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=398.0s)]
*  I'm very excited that we got to do that last night. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=401.3s)]
*  I'm so fortunate, you know, shouts out to Scott once again. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUTj7seyEq8&t=404.0s)]
