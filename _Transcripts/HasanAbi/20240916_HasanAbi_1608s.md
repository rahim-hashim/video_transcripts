# ‘The Five’ On Trump Shot At |  Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0)
*  I think eight of them are working. We have billions of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=0.0s)]
*  dollars. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=3.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think they're wrong. They're wrong. And I'm [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=4.12s)]
*  unafraid to say it. They're wrong. Brave take. I know. I [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  think I think that they should take all of those funds that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=11.68s)]
*  they would allocate to the president so we can play golf [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  again. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=18.92s)]
*  The five [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=24.68s)]
*  moments ago, the FBI Secret Service and other officials [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=25.92s)]
*  giving a secret service successfully protects Trump, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=29.16s)]
*  maybe even go above and beyond in terms of like, you know, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=32.28s)]
*  shooting at a dude immediately and missing. Okay. And all the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=36.8s)]
*  Republicans can say is like they should do it more. Like, what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=42.64s)]
*  do you want them to do? Just shoot at random people. They [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=45.68s)]
*  should just start shooting at random white people in Trump's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=48.44s)]
*  vicinity that are registered Republicans because so far, it's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=51.0s)]
*  two for two. Is that the is that the suggestion that you guys [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=55.44s)]
*  have if someone looks if someone is a registered [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=58.32s)]
*  Republican and is a you know, white guy from any range any age [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=62.16s)]
*  range, then immediately the Secret Service starts, they have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=66.48s)]
*  to start blasting. Shoot first ask questions later. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=70.64s)]
*  A major update on the second attempt on Donald Trump's life. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=74.08s)]
*  Watch this here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=77.72s)]
*  The subject who did not have line of sight to the former [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=78.44s)]
*  president fled the scene. He did not fire or get off at our [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=81.12s)]
*  agent. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  What we did yesterday proves that the system can work because [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=86.56s)]
*  the suspect didn't even get close to getting around off. And [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=91.64s)]
*  we apprehended him and brought him to justice. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=95.92s)]
*  It comes as we get chilling new details on the would be including [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=99.28s)]
*  what he was doing right before getting caught. New records show [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=102.44s)]
*  that 58 year old Ryan Ruth was lying in wait, spending nearly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=105.8s)]
*  12 hours hiding in a sniper's nest near Trump's golf course [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=109.68s)]
*  before being confronted. A Secret Service agent opening fire [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=113.56s)]
*  after spotting a rifle poking through a chain link fence while [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=117.04s)]
*  the former president was golfing causing the suspect to flee in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=120.36s)]
*  a car until cops caught up with him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=123.52s)]
*  The Secret Service director also addressing concerns that his [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=132.64s)]
*  agency needs more resources. Watch here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=135.16s)]
*  We also have a necessary. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=138.12s)]
*  Yeah, dude, cops cops will take any and every opportunity cops [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=139.72s)]
*  will take any and every opportunity to beg for more [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=146.12s)]
*  resources. It's like, it's like, dude, what do you what more do [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=148.56s)]
*  you want? Cops will not stop. It's like cops in Israel. Israel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=152.48s)]
*  also very cop like anyway, and also directly does train our [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=156.8s)]
*  cops. It's just like you have to give us every dime. Okay, you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=160.88s)]
*  have to give us every dime out of your paycheck directly. We [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=166.6s)]
*  need nukes. We need tactical nukes. Okay, we simply do not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=170.32s)]
*  have enough. We simply do not have enough. We need more. We [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=174.12s)]
*  always need more. There's always money that you can give us. You [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=178.28s)]
*  need to give us more money right now. If they're unsuccessful, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=182.04s)]
*  they say you need to give us more money. That's why we were [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=185.64s)]
*  unsuccessful. If they are successful. In this situation, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=188.0s)]
*  they were they're like, you need to give us more money. We are [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=192.04s)]
*  successful. So we need it. We want it. We deserve it. Look at [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=194.26s)]
*  how good of a job we did. That's crazy. 30k viewers bettas on is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  wishing for more attempts. Dog I had 30,000 viewers before [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump got sniped at well he didn't even get sniped. Let's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  be real. So do you mean like in terms of doing political [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  coverage like Donald Trump being that is such a normal occurrence [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=214.1s)]
*  now that it doesn't actually meet the it doesn't actually give me [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=217.42s)]
*  a noticeable bump like people just kind of expected at this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  point. It's turned into it's turned into literally a the same [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=225.58s)]
*  as like a school shooting. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=230.62s)]
*  Very need for to make sure that we're getting the personnel that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=232.22000000000003s)]
*  we have. And that requires us to be able to have the the funding [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  to be able to hire more people. You can't just give me money and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=240.06s)]
*  say, Hey, we're going to make sure that everybody gets over [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=243.38000000000002s)]
*  time. Because the men and women of the Secret Service right now [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=245.9s)]
*  we are redlining them and they are rising to this. It's like a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  car chase. No, because when I watch when I react in real time [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=252.22s)]
*  to a car chase, I get a noticeable 10k bump. Okay, but [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  but school shootings and and Trump getting that are so normal [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=261.58s)]
*  now that people don't even care. They're like, Whatever. It's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=265.78s)]
*  another I guess it's another Monday, you know, moment and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=268.34s)]
*  they are meeting the challenges right now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=272.14s)]
*  All right, judge, take us through your thoughts. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=274.18s)]
*  Why do you watch Fox News? So I know what real Americans are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=276.74s)]
*  thinking. I went down a focus on pipeline on YouTube last night [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=280.06s)]
*  and really having watched you for over a year. It's insane how [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=282.98s)]
*  much people just make up and clip you out of context. Yeah, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=284.98s)]
*  because there are people like you who go down that pipeline [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=288.3s)]
*  and give them views. That's why. But anyway, no, I watch Fox News [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=291.06s)]
*  because I'm a Fox News watcher. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=295.62s)]
*  Well, this is the second attempt in two months and you're only [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=297.54s)]
*  lucky so many times. Now the secret [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=301.5s)]
*  judge Jeanine Perot might as well be a Florida Sheriff the way [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=305.06s)]
*  she's always slurring her goddamn words. Okay, yeah, I'm [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=309.1s)]
*  a Fox News dad. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=312.82s)]
*  service you may recall told us that the protection [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=313.98s)]
*  third time might as well be that child. Ah, our big beautiful [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=317.46s)]
*  presidents under fire again. These liberals are out of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=324.62s)]
*  control with their rhetoric they're saying and I'm going to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=329.38s)]
*  issue a once in a lifetime trigger warning here they're [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=333.3s)]
*  saying he's a meanie bobini. They keep using his words [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=336.14s)]
*  against him like how he said he's got to be a dictator for one [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=340.62s)]
*  day. They keep saying that because he said that you can't [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=344.98s)]
*  do that. You're not allowed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=351.34s)]
*  Now Donald Trump was upgraded after we received the Iranian [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=354.14s)]
*  intelligence of the threat against him based upon his [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=358.14s)]
*  takedown of Soleimani as well as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and but [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=361.62s)]
*  what we saw in in Butler was a fiasco of finger pointing by the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  Secret Service as well as incompetence and reluctance by [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=372.86s)]
*  the Secret Service, although I would point out that we still [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=376.46s)]
*  haven't gotten the final report on this. But on yesterday, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=379.94s)]
*  thank God that there was one Secret Service agent who was [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=383.58s)]
*  able to see the barrel of that rifle coming through a gated [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=387.06s)]
*  fence and was able to shoot and God bless him for the fact that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=392.62s)]
*  he had the ability to see and stop that. But I also want to be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  clear that I don't know that the attempted would have been caught [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  but for a civilian who took a photo of the car and got the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=405.02s)]
*  plate number. So the first question I have is is there [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=409.29999999999995s)]
*  really communication or is there communication at all between the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=412.5s)]
*  local police and the Secret Service? Now there also is you [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=416.74s)]
*  know, why there's still question as to whether or not [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=422.42s)]
*  Donald Trump is getting presidential level protection. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=426.18s)]
*  There were no drones. Okay, there were no dogs. And you know, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=429.94s)]
*  he's talking about either they need more people or they need [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  more money. And the Secret Service said yesterday that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=438.1s)]
*  Secret Service is quote, limited to areas that the Secret [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=442.14s)]
*  Service deems possible. So why doesn't the group that is so [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=445.7s)]
*  into reimagining the police and reimagining everything, deeming [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=450.26s)]
*  that it's possible for someone to be able to see through that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=454.7s)]
*  hole, where people all the time, including the press take photos [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=459.26s)]
*  of President Trump playing on the golf course, everybody knows [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=463.78s)]
*  that that's an area that is capable. It's a major thorough [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  fair. And at the same time, you know, don't tell me that you [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=470.78s)]
*  don't have the ability to secure outside of that fence. And they [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=474.5s)]
*  say that they can't close that particular spot. I'm not so sure [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=478.74s)]
*  that they couldn't have done that. Now Biden says Secret [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=482.7s)]
*  Service needs more help. Congress should give him more [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=485.9s)]
*  help. I have an idea. Biden could simply assign more help. He [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=488.42s)]
*  can redirect funds. We have seven and a half billion dollars [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=492.98s)]

*  are working. We have billions of dollars. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=499.5s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think they're wrong. They're wrong. And I'm unafraid [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=502.74s)]
*  to say it. They're wrong. Brave take I know. I think I think [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=507.14s)]
*  that they should take all of those funds that they would [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=512.02s)]
*  allocate to the president so we can play golf again, and give it [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=515.1s)]
*  to Israel. Okay, I think that Judge Jeanine Perot does not [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=518.9s)]
*  have her priorities set. We should be giving it to Israel. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=523.3s)]
*  That's really tough. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=527.24s)]
*  Every year they're going towards illegal. We don't even know how [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=528.0600000000001s)]
*  many are coming. But we got the money for them. And so don't [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=531.18s)]
*  tell me you can't redirect funds. And finally, what is the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=534.9s)]
*  mission of the Secret Service? The mission of the Secret [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=539.18s)]
*  Service is supposed to be the protection of the president, his [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=542.3s)]
*  family and dignitaries. I can tell you as a local DA for 32 [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=544.9s)]
*  years that the Secret Service is always competing on economic [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=549.8599999999999s)]
*  with local attorney generals. Why is the Secret Service [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=554.54s)]
*  involved in 2009? They created an electronic task force in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=558.02s)]
*  Rome, Italy, no less, where it was a public private partnership [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=563.1s)]
*  to go after high tech computer based. Why are they doing [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=567.34s)]
*  everything that local DAs and attorney generals are doing, as [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=570.82s)]
*  well as every other three letter agency is doing? And finally, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=574.34s)]
*  get out of our business. Don't tell me you don't have the money [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=578.66s)]
*  and you don't have the time. Hire merit based upon merit and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=581.86s)]
*  not DEA. And the final thing I'm going to say is if you don't [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=586.22s)]
*  have the right people go to the military, you've got military [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=588.94s)]

*  someone, I don't know if she is. I don't know if she's just full [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=611.02s)]

*  this, almost always they're Lebanese, the Christian [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=618.46s)]

*  Okay, there's a lot of secret Lebanese people out there. Okay, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=634.38s)]
*  God damn, I clocked it. Yeah, specifically Christian or [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=639.0200000000001s)]
*  Persian. Nah, Persians can't hide like this. Okay. Persians [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=643.58s)]
*  don't read. No, no, you're wrong. Persians wish they could [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=647.94s)]
*  read white like this. Okay, some Persians. Not all these the ones [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=653.46s)]
*  that are in my near vicinity. Listen, I didn't just your next [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=659.82s)]
*  level white races. I didn't just tell you that she was Lebanese. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=663.74s)]
*  I told you exactly what kind Okay, this is a very specific [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=667.94s)]
*  thing that you see. All right, I meant it would jump at the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=672.3000000000001s)]
*  chance of this have the clearance it's needed to do [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=675.0200000000001s)]
*  this, then have a mental and physical ability to do it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=677.9000000000001s)]
*  Yep. And Harold, I think well, I think that Secret Service, they [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=681.1400000000001s)]
*  started 1865 under Treasury Department. So financials were a [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=684.4200000000001s)]
*  part of their remit at the time. But at this point, you have two [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=687.9000000000001s)]
*  things happening. One, the golfing expedition was off the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=691.9000000000001s)]
*  record, not on the schedule. But apparently, Ruth was in the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=695.78s)]
*  tree for 12 hours. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=699.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard the same thing. First, I hope everyone had a [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=701.5s)]
*  good weekend as good as you could have and glad to be back [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=703.42s)]
*  around. I agree with some things the judges said, and I disagree [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=705.42s)]
*  with some things I agree wholeheartedly. Based on what the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=708.9s)]
*  sheriff said, and the sheriff of the county said that President [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=712.74s)]
*  Trump phoned him and thanked him and all of the law enforcement [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=715.02s)]
*  for their for their efforts. And I understand that President [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=718.1s)]
*  Trump, at least according to the reports has told the Secret [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=721.14s)]
*  Service, thank you for your efforts. I won't I won't tread [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=723.5s)]
*  over things that the judges already said, but there are a [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=726.86s)]
*  couple questions that I still have. And I hope we'll get get [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=730.82s)]
*  the from I thought the press conference was constructive. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=735.34s)]
*  They told us what they knew and what they don't know. Hopefully [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=737.3000000000001s)]
*  they'll come back and tell us when they do not do know these [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=740.7800000000001s)]
*  things. And one of 2345 things I want to know is when did the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=742.86s)]
*  guy get to Palm Beach? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=745.74s)]
*  This guy sucks. Like he sits on the Lib seat, but he's never he [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=747.34s)]
*  cannot hold a candle to my go Jessica Tarkov. I'm such a Fox [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=752.54s)]
*  News dad like I'm on ironically, 100% of Fox News dad, I have my [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=757.54s)]
*  favorites, dude. I just like, like that's when you know, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=763.02s)]
*  we've gone beyond the point of no return. Okay, like I have my I [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=767.06s)]
*  have my favorite Fox News hosts. And I get upset when they're [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=771.38s)]
*  not. They're not on. Oh, God. Where's Jessica? They fire have [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=776.4599999999999s)]
*  been too woke. I think they fired her for being pregnant. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=782.02s)]
*  And by that, I mean, I think she might be wasn't she like [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=785.54s)]
*  pregnant or something? I think she's like might be given birth. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=788.26s)]
*  They didn't fire her by the way. I'm just saying she might be on [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=791.02s)]
*  maternity leave, or maybe she's just like doing less appearances [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=794.26s)]
*  for that reason. How long had he been there? Was he ever bed [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=799.54s)]
*  minster or for that matter? Any other her ex husband Albert [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=804.14s)]
*  Perot spent 17 months in jail for tax evasion. And even [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=807.26s)]
*  though he was well past his jail years, he was still pardoned [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=809.86s)]
*  by Trump law. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=812.86s)]
*  A place that President Trump has been over the last six to 12 [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=814.14s)]
*  months. And I think if we get answers to these questions, we [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=816.94s)]
*  will get the answer to I think, the question that is [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=819.54s)]
*  reverberating in my mind when I when I began when we learned the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=822.26s)]
*  president was safe. And that a fire I did learn the press [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=825.58s)]
*  conversation fired the guy did not have a line of sight. But [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=829.1s)]
*  the real question is, was he working with them with an [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=831.94s)]
*  adversary or foreign adversary? And we don't know the answer to [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=834.0600000000001s)]
*  that yet. People say that guys is perhaps low level and not [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=838.34s)]
*  sophisticated enough. But normally those are the very [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=841.86s)]
*  people who sometimes may be either knowing or unknowingly [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=845.58s)]
*  working with people they shouldn't be working with. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=848.4200000000001s)]
*  Finally, this notion of resources where I differ a [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=850.7s)]
*  little bit, but judge and you, you certainly have a strong [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=853.1s)]
*  theory around this as well. I just think whatever resources [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=855.82s)]
*  that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=859.1800000000001s)]
*  that's, you want to know why this guy sucks? Because Jessica [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=859.7s)]
*  Tarkov actually presents like solid cases. And when she does [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=862.7800000000001s)]
*  the content is better. This guy's also a man. So Jesse [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=867.06s)]
*  waters isn't saying like gross ad about women enough. He will [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=869.9s)]
*  still say some gross ad about women. Obviously, it's Jesse [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  waters. But like, he's not kind of directing it in his [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=877.26s)]
*  direction. Right? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=881.26s)]
*  They may need with redirecting something from from one thing to [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=882.9799999999999s)]
*  the other. If the Congress wants to come back, and I think that [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  everyone would vote for an emergency supplemental to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=889.9399999999999s)]
*  provide whatever the Secret Service may need in terms of [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=892.5s)]
*  more training, more people, whatever the more munitions, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=897.06s)]
*  whatever it may be. And one of the things we may know is that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=899.9s)]
*  if indeed the if it's an off the record thing, which we learned [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=902.7399999999999s)]
*  this was, we know the president likes to go there. So maybe they [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=905.18s)]
*  should just sweep these things anyway. And if they need more [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=907.9799999999999s)]
*  resources for this kind of thing, that's what we should, we [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=910.2199999999999s)]
*  should not only perhaps give them what's that's what we [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=913.26s)]
*  should absolutely [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=915.5799999999999s)]
*  boring, boring, boring, move on, shut up, you're saying the same [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=916.5799999999999s)]
*  that all the dummies are saying, Jesse, what you're supposed to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=921.4599999999999s)]
*  at least present yourself as a dummy crat, dumbass, you're [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=924.94s)]
*  sitting on the dummy crat chair, fuck [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=928.46s)]

*  So he's all over the FBI's radar. He was all over the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=943.62s)]
*  media's radar. And he was all over the State Department's [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=946.6600000000001s)]
*  radar. State Department got a tip about him when he was in [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=949.82s)]

*  the hell is this guy? Yep. You know, you see he's wearing like [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=964.4599999999999s)]
*  an expensive pea coat with some preppy tie and he's got a Ralph [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=967.3s)]

*  Okay. None of those. Wait, what? No, I don't think he was a big [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=972.4599999999999s)]
*  baller at all. I don't think he was like even remotely a big [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=977.6999999999999s)]
*  baller. I think he's absolutely a crank. Like he is. He is [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=981.5s)]
*  absolutely a crank. Okay. He exhibits all of the crank [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=987.14s)]
*  tendencies, including but not limited to adding Zelensky, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=992.18s)]
*  adding Dave Matthews band, adding Bruno Mars on Twitter, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=997.22s)]
*  and demanding that they collaborate with him. He sent [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1001.18s)]
*  out a tweet to Elon Musk being like, give me a spaceship, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1004.98s)]
*  please. I need to put nuclear warheads on it and dive head [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1008.18s)]

*  American crank. Noah's on this Fox. I was about to go [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1017.06s)]
*  conspiracy mode. I know and I really love him for it. But [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1020.06s)]
*  let's hear it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1023.14s)]
*  You know, he's wearing all camouflage and red, white and [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1023.78s)]
*  blue. This man is nuts. I don't trust him. And I want to know [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1027.86s)]
*  everywhere where this guy's been. Because he's a Ukraine [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1031.62s)]
*  radical. He's been radicalized either self radicalized or some [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1035.62s)]
*  other foreign entity has a hold of him or maybe [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1039.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So Disney is something we don't even want to talk about [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1043.1799999999998s)]
*  because this guy, you don't have a convict like that running [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1046.1s)]
*  around out in the open like that, getting interviewed by [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1049.8999999999999s)]
*  the times and just showing up at the right place at the right [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1052.7399999999998s)]
*  time. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1056.8999999999999s)]
*  Wait, you can't be talking about convicts dog. Like you're, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1057.9799999999998s)]
*  you're literally advocating to vote for one on a daily basis. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1061.9399999999998s)]
*  Okay. You mean this guy's a convict. His freedom of movement [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1065.3s)]
*  must be limited. Now we got lucky. They didn't even sweep [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1069.42s)]
*  the perimeter until he was already on the course. They [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1073.3799999999999s)]
*  didn't pre sweep it and they're patting themselves on their [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1076.62s)]
*  back. They better be kidding me. And this isn't about money. Joe [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1079.78s)]
*  Biden just spent like $20 trillion. There's plenty of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1083.62s)]
*  money. He wants money. They can have the money. They have as [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1086.66s)]
*  much money as we can print. When has it ever stopped us? We [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1089.98s)]
*  just printed. This is about priorities. The Biden Harris [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1092.86s)]
*  administration has not been able to protect their rival, either [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1097.26s)]
*  they're reckless. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1101.9399999999998s)]
*  Is he dead? Did he die? No. So I guess they are protecting their [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1103.54s)]
*  rival. You know what I mean? Why are they acting like Trump is [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1109.1s)]
*  dead, dude? He had to do a jab in there throw a little jab in [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1112.62s)]
*  there about printing money to it's so funny. They're printing [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1116.2199999999998s)]
*  money like it's now tomorrow. I think controversial opinion [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1120.02s)]
*  time. I think they're protecting Trump too well. I think they [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1124.3s)]
*  should protect Trump less make things a little bit more [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1128.22s)]
*  interesting. That way you get to save taxpayer taxpayer dollars, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1131.02s)]
*  which we can give to Israel. Okay, that's my priority. I'm a [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1136.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm a normal American guy. Okay. And as a normal as a median [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1140.8600000000001s)]
*  voter. Well, one I'm already a NATO voter. As you guys know, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1145.5s)]
*  I'm an AUKUS voter. So I think he did nothing wrong. Ryan. He's [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1149.46s)]
*  he had all the good positions. He must be he must be [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1154.54s)]
*  immediately freed. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm a rate. I'm a NATO [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1158.38s)]
*  voter. I'm a NATO voter. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1162.5s)]
*  Or they don't care that much. But this guy, do you realize how [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1164.38s)]
*  extraordinary to have to attempted on one guy with huge [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1167.94s)]
*  security lapses in the span of what a couple weeks? That's [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1173.06s)]
*  insane, Dana. Joe Biden came out and was listless. If I was [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1177.22s)]
*  president, and this would happen on my watch, I'd fire someone. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1182.14s)]
*  I'd fire someone if this had happened to a bomb. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1185.7s)]
*  Wait, dude, they succeeded. Like the dude didn't even fire off. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1188.5s)]
*  What are they complaining about? Do you need time off or [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1194.66s)]
*  something? What? Why? Because I said that we need to spend all of [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1197.94s)]
*  our dollars on Israel. You can't think good conscious think I'm [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1203.94s)]
*  being serious, right? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1207.7s)]
*  I think about it. There was no attempt to on Barack Obama's life [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1209.38s)]
*  like this. And if there was Fox News, it'd probably be out of [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1212.06s)]
*  business. Rush Limbaugh would probably be yanked off the air [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1215.06s)]
*  because they said something critical. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1218.66s)]
*  Wait, what? Dude, Bill O'Reilly is responsible for the direct of [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1221.14s)]
*  a doctor who he named by name, every tiller tiller the baby. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1228.42s)]
*  Okay, like, what are you talking about? It did nothing to Fox [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1235.26s)]
*  News. Also rushes already burning in hell. So I don't know [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1239.02s)]
*  why he's talking about Rush Limbaugh. Yeah, Bill O'Reilly [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1241.9s)]
*  waged an unflagging harassment campaign against the abortion [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1245.66s)]
*  provider before tiller was in 2009. So he got his wishes. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1248.6200000000001s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1252.38s)]
*  I think about the kind of things they're saying about this guy. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1253.46s)]
*  And it's completely normalized. Joe Biden's at the beach. They [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1255.98s)]
*  can protect him. Kamala Harris is riding around on a bus that [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1260.74s)]
*  says Kamala Harris all over rural Georgia. No one's ever [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1264.1s)]
*  tried. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1268.1399999999999s)]
*  I think like most cranks forgot Joe Biden is even president. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1268.54s)]
*  That's why he can just go to Rehoboth Beach and just hang out [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1272.34s)]
*  with his tits out. You know, like, that's probably what it [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1276.58s)]
*  is. Because most cranks don't even know he's president right [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1280.1s)]
*  now dog like [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1284.3799999999999s)]
*  tried anything. They're perfectly fine with protecting [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1285.74s)]
*  those people, but they can't protect one man and the answer [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1288.1799999999998s)]
*  why can't they protect that guy? And that's the question. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1291.5s)]
*  Well, I think the Dems have to read [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1295.54s)]
*  what they did, like successfully. And it's so funny [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1296.62s)]
*  because Joe branded being that he is immediately was our we got [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1300.74s)]
*  to give more money to the Secret Service jack. Like not only did [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1303.6999999999998s)]
*  they successfully protect them, but they're probably going to [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1307.02s)]
*  get more funds [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1309.22s)]
*  realize there is a risk in amplifying the message that this [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1310.3s)]
*  guy has to be stopped at all costs. On the plus side, you get [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1313.46s)]
*  a lot of people believing that Trump is an existential risk. On [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1317.1000000000001s)]
*  the negative side, you get a lot of people believing that Trump [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1320.46s)]
*  is an existential risk. So that activates it's a pretty genuine [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1322.82s)]
*  way to brainwash somebody. It activates those on the margins of [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1327.14s)]
*  society to fulfill your implicit directive. You see, when you [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1331.5s)]
*  brand somebody Hitler, that has a long standing effect. You [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1336.02s)]
*  see the media trying to tie this to the rhetoric about Springfield. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1341.26s)]
*  Well, a this guy isn't from Haiti. And B, that is not how [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1345.8999999999999s)]
*  brainwashing works. Brainwashing is created through a sustained [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1349.34s)]
*  repetition of messages for a long period of time. It wouldn't [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1352.94s)]
*  happen in a few days after some kind of outburst. You know, after [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1357.8999999999999s)]
*  a story appears, it happens after months or years of specific [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1362.34s)]
*  ominous rhetoric targeting the object for elimination. In this [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1366.4199999999998s)]
*  case, you could say it's cause and effect. It's been four or [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1370.14s)]
*  five years of this. It's interesting to me. It's really [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1372.14s)]
*  dumb. I can't believe I can't believe they're correctly [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1375.7800000000002s)]
*  calling Trump Hitler for the it's the same people who push [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1379.14s)]
*  the concept of hate speech in its most absurd form. You know, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1383.26s)]
*  using the wrong pronoun is hate speech, employ it in its purest [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1387.74s)]
*  shape for years. And then you have you got to wonder why are [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1392.0600000000002s)]
*  pundits blaming Trump's rhetoric for this attempt? I can only [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1396.26s)]
*  think it's to approve Democrats, Democrats polling with abusive [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1399.78s)]
*  husbands, because it's no different. It's not Trump's [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1403.1s)]
*  rhetoric. It's how the media twists the rhetoric into a [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1406.3s)]
*  different at a different meeting. Bloodbath is talking [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1409.3s)]
*  about the auto industry, their profits that do most people know [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1412.98s)]
*  that probably not drinking bleach, the fine people hoax. It [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1418.18s)]
*  was never Trump's rhetoric. It was the hoaxing of it that [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1422.22s)]
*  created this kind of umbrella notion that Trump is an [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1425.3s)]
*  existential racist and that encouraged that is the brain [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1429.42s)]
*  washing. You know, I watch a lot of Dateline. So I understand [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  motive and opportunity. And it both suspects you have moat. He [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDtvcgzc0&t=1437.46s)]
