# Can We Still Trust Bernie Sanders? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ)
*  No, Bernie Sanders is a leader in the leftist movement in this country, a very important figure, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  very important figure that knows better, and a very important figure, especially when it comes to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=6.72s)]
*  talking about Israel, specifically because he is the most prominent and the most popular Jewish [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=12.32s)]
*  American politician. Did you see Bernard did it again? For the second time in the span of a week, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=19.68s)]
*  Bernie Sanders was again interrupted a campaign rally several actors from the United Liberation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=29.2s)]
*  Front for Palestine called our senator in Bakersfield, California for his record Israel [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=32.4s)]
*  amidst the US back Bernie again returned his campaign talking points was refused to engage [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=36.32s)]
*  with the criticism he was facing by the protesters. Dude, I want I want people to to criticize [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=40.08s)]
*  Bernie Sanders is Israel statements in a directional fashion by demanding that he do more but also [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=44.96s)]
*  explain what the expectations are. There needs to be a little bit more messaging discipline on this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=57.36s)]
*  because like asking him to call it is fair. I think that is a fair demand. Right? Like or asking [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=62.08s)]
*  why he doesn't call it is a is a fair question. Right. But if you're going to be like, Oh, your [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=70.32s)]
*  legislative track record is like ass or whatever. Why are you constantly voting? Why why won't you [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=76.0s)]
*  call for legislative action against weapons transfers to Israel? Like within your wrong, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=84.48s)]
*  like he is doing that. You know what I mean? So get it right. It's important to get it right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  Reality, on the other hand, is not wrong. It is right. It's the correct thing to the correct [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=94.0s)]
*  thing to ask. I don't think it's a simple distraction. Which is precisely the reason why [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  I tried to enter the conversation when I had when I talked to him. When I talked to him personally, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  when I talked to Bernie Sanders personally, the question that I had for him was like, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  what do we do about the First Amendment violations from the direction of like protecting Israel? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=115.84s)]
*  Like what the administration is doing at the behest of Israel is undermining First Amendment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=121.68s)]
*  It was just something I know you care about. Right. Like that is a directional way to get [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Bernie to talk extensively about this issue. I got Bernie's first endorsement. I know I have [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=131.68s)]
*  that in the docket. We of course didn't have enough time to cover that to talk about that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=136.64s)]
*  And it's interesting because like it's not like Bernie Sanders finds himself at odds with people [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  who do recognize what Israel's doing as a genocide. He is after all passing the torch over [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=147.92s)]
*  to AOC who has recognized the genocide, called it out as it is in Congress. Okay. And same with, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=155.76s)]
*  you look nervous. Lol. It's cool. You got this. Dude, imagine being this level of parasocial. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=164.64s)]
*  You think I'm nervous. Why the f*** would I be nervous? Dumbass. I do this every goddamn day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=169.92s)]
*  Are you stupid? Anyway, here's the blast off meme by the way. Let the people know. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=175.04s)]
*  Let the people know. This isn't needed, homie. Chill. Don't tell me what's needed. I don't [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  get why people attack one dude fighting for them though. Like isn't that just a snake eating his [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=186.88s)]
*  tail? No, Bernie Sanders is a leader in the leftist movement in this country. A very important figure. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=191.28s)]
*  Very important figure that knows better and a very important figure especially when it comes to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=198.48s)]
*  talking about Israel. Specifically because he is the most prominent and the most popular Jewish [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=204.08s)]
*  American politician. Okay. He has so much influential power to change discourse in this country [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=211.44s)]
*  and he has done that in the past. That's why I'm saying that like, like my expectation of him has [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=220.88s)]
*  always been, my expectation of him has always been that he was incredibly underwhelming and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=228.56s)]
*  incredibly disappointing in the aftermath of October 7 with the lack of communication at first [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  or even how he communicated about it when he did, you know? Man, there are no Jill Stein voters. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=240.4s)]
*  Yeah, where's Jill Stein? I mean, I asked this question yesterday. Where is Jill Stein? Bernie's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  out there. Where's Jill Stein? Is she out there? Is she out there? Where you at, Jill? Maybe she'll [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=251.28s)]
*  hear me and then she'll come out. Just kidding. She's like the the groundhog. She only comes out [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=257.04s)]
*  every four years. She's hibernating for all the work that she's going to put into running her office [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=264.64s)]
*  every four years, you know? Classic. Remember this. I'm going to keep hammering this point [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  because a lot of you yelled at me. A lot of you yelled at me. Okay. There's a lot of you that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  understandably are frustrated with the two party duopoly that we have and a lot of you yelled at [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=283.12s)]
*  me. This is not an I told you so moment. Okay. Make no mistake. I don't care. I was right and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=288.32s)]
*  that's fine. I'm always, I always find myself to be correct. Regardless, I don't even fault you for [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=293.84s)]
*  daring to believe that there's an alternative out there. I don't fault you for the protest [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=300.72s)]
*  that you wanted to have that you wanted to put forward. But I want you to remember this [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=307.68s)]
*  for one reason and one reason only. Four years from now, it's gonna happen again. Don't get duped. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  That's it. That's the only reason why I'm saying this. Because I don't want you to get freaking [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=320.88000000000005s)]
*  duped four years down the line again and forget that she's not here. Why is she not here? Don't [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=325.76s)]
*  you think that she should be here? It's not like the issues went away. Yeah. That is of course only [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=332.88s)]
*  if there is another election. What is this? That's a lie. She was just out at a conference. That's a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=338.24s)]
*  lie. Oh my God. The Jill Stein heads are in here. My bad. She's doing a four year Goku energy surge. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=342.88s)]
*  Yeah, I simply cannot comprehend the inner machinations of Jill Stein's mind. I can't. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=349.52s)]
*  How come I never hear a thing about her all year? I follow news every day. Well, I mean, look, the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=357.84s)]
*  argument there is that she is the argument there would be like the media doesn't cover her unless [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=362.96s)]
*  she is seen as like a spoiler candidate every four years or whatever. What the Bernie Coppium [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=369.6s)]
*  is really disappointing. I expected a real change in opinion. What? I'm done having this conversation. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=374.72s)]
*  It is the most it is the least productive conversation of all time. I have poured countless [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  hours into this idiotic take over and over again. If you think that I'm like, you know, unconditionally [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  in support of everything Bernie says and does, I don't know what to tell you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  Okay, it's just it's fine, man. Hey, you're you and the vanguard is going to magically exist. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=398.0s)]
*  Go to a Bernie rally and start organizing in a Bernie rally. Stop chirping. Those people that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=404.64s)]
*  participate in those rallies are literally closer to you in their opinions on Israel than they are [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=410.8s)]
*  to Bernie, but they still go out there and they still show up. It is on you to talk to those people [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  and to guide them in a direction where we can all make meaningful change. Stop chirping in here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=423.84s)]
*  You're annoying. Okay, it makes you feel like you're doing something. You're not doing anything. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  You're just being annoying. God damn, this never ends. Holy shit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQTS9dGbfQ&t=439.12s)]
