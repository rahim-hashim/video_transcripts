# Join The Protest With Thousands In D.C
**HasanAbi:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4)
*  Plenty of them are here on the streets right now, but overall the per capita cruelty captured in such a small area is palpable and you feel it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=0.0s)]
*  Ugly ass buildings filled with bureaucrats that use the power of the pen to assassinate people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=16.0s)]
*  We'll be at the march. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=30.0s)]
*  From the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations, please welcome Streska Han. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=34.0s)]
*  We've been waiting for an interview for about two seconds. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=38.0s)]
*  Hi, mother. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=41.0s)]
*  We're going to be at the march too. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=43.0s)]
*  We know that our hearts are broken. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=47.0s)]
*  I know many of us feel as if we have failed months ago because of the Jewish cops and genocide and the occupation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=51.0s)]
*  Tolerate it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=59.0s)]
*  Not right now, I've got to do an interview. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=62.0s)]
*  I'll be around. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=64.0s)]
*  Alright, we're doing an interview. What is this for? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=66.0s)]
*  This is for the PYM. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=70.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=72.0s)]
*  The Palestinian Youth Movement. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=73.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=75.0s)]
*  Check. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=77.0s)]
*  Check. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=79.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=81.0s)]
*  Alright, so the genocide has been going on for 17 months and you've taken an active role through your media to kind of get your messaging, your narrative and kind of uplift the voices of the Palestinian people on the ground. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=83.0s)]
*  Can you tell us what have your reflections been for the past 17 months of this? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=95.0s)]
*  The well of the pravity is endless. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=100.0s)]
*  It's truly alarming. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=104.0s)]
*  I mean, in some ways I'm hopeful because there are more and more people every single day that put their bodies on the line to go out to protest, to spread awareness. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=107.0s)]
*  But in some ways I think the cruelty is impossible to disregard. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=118.0s)]
*  It's just the cruelty enacted upon the Palestinian population by Israel and the United States of America, but also the cruelty for speaking out against it here on US soil. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=126.0s)]
*  But as I tell people all the time on my stream, if you're feeling discouraged coming out to a protest like this, coming out to a rally like this, we'll embolden you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=137.0s)]
*  It will help you understand that you are not alone, that your cause is just and we should try to do everything we can to put an end to the genocide. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=148.0s)]
*  And if you have a message to the people in Gaza, the Palestinian people in Gaza who are watching right now, what would you say to them? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=160.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=169.0s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=172.0s)]
*  There's nothing more I can do. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=174.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm trying to do my very best. I know everyone here is trying to do their very best. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=178.0s)]
*  We see it. We see the images every day. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=182.0s)]
*  It destroys my soul. It destroys my heart. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=184.0s)]
*  The things that human beings are capable of doing to one another. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=188.0s)]
*  I really do hope that one day I'll be able to visit. I hope that one day Palestine will be free. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=193.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=201.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=202.0s)]
*  I ran out of storage in the last 15 seconds. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=203.0s)]
*  That's fine. We ran out of storage, but that's fine. Thank you, dude. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=211.0s)]
*  No problem. Thank you for organizing this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=215.0s)]
*  Appreciate you, bro. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=218.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=219.0s)]
*  I hope you guys are having the best time. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=220.0s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=222.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=225.0s)]
*  Can you check the battery? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah. What's going on? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=237.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=239.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=240.0s)]
*  It's at 100%. Why is it still at 100%? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=241.0s)]
*  They're charging. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=244.0s)]
*  Oh, did you flip it? It's still charging. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=245.0s)]
*  It hasn't been that long, though. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=247.0s)]
*  Okay. What's up? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=249.0s)]
*  You're selling my press pass? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=250.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=321.0s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, I got it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=357.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=358.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. Thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=359.0s)]
*  Okay, thank you. I'll take it. One second. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=366.0s)]
*  Okay, okay. All right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=368.0s)]
*  How are we doing? Are we good? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=372.0s)]
*  We're good. We're just doing 10 seconds. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=373.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=374.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=375.0s)]
*  So you're just your message to the people in Palestine [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=376.0s)]
*  who are watching and the people of Gaza. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=378.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's my message to the Palestinian people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=382.0s)]
*  I see endless cruelty enacted by my government [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=386.0s)]
*  allowing the Israeli government to continue doing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=390.0s)]
*  We are all morally culpable, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=394.0s)]
*  and I hope that one day Palestine will be free. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=396.0s)]
*  I hope that one day we'll put an end to this senseless cruelty [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=403.0s)]
*  and that you deserve emancipation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=407.0s)]
*  And I hope more and more Americans, more and more Westerners, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=410.0s)]
*  are waking up to that reality. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=414.0s)]
*  So I hope in all of this cruelty and all of this violence, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=416.0s)]
*  there's at least a sliver of hope that emancipation is inevitable [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=420.0s)]
*  and it's closer than ever before. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=425.0s)]
*  All right. Thank you, son. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=428.0s)]
*  All right. Appreciate you again. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=430.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=433.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=439.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, can I get a water? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=443.0s)]
*  I got to tell them we're speaking out against F***ing Iran. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=445.0s)]
*  All right. What do you want to do for audio? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=448.0s)]
*  I think this is fine. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=452.0s)]
*  We don't need the shotgun, do we? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=454.0s)]
*  I think this is better. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=456.0s)]
*  Audio is good. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=463.0s)]
*  Noah got the un-grill outfit. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=467.0s)]
*  Snazzy, my boy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=469.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're looking snazzy there, saying. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=471.0s)]
*  Well, no, thank you. I'm glad I looked snazzy. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=474.0s)]
*  Wait, where's my bag? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=476.0s)]
*  I'll grab it. I got it. I got it. Thank you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=479.0s)]
*  Why do your fans always call me unk? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=483.0s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=486.0s)]
*  Because you're old. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=487.0s)]

*  No! [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3056.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I mean! [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3058.58s)]
*  I think it shows that like [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3060.58s)]
*  I think it shows that the discourse has shifted [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3062.58s)]
*  a lot. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3064.58s)]
*  It's like, cause the way I see it [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3066.58s)]
*  JVP initially was similar [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3068.58s)]
*  maybe a little bit more radical than if not now [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3070.58s)]
*  but like, it was [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3072.58s)]
*  you know, peaceniks! [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3074.58s)]
*  Well yeah, it's like [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3076.58s)]
*  not like my, like [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3078.58s)]
*  I don't think, I think if you were [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3080.58s)]
*  like if you identified as a political liberal [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3082.58s)]
*  like JVP was a home [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3084.58s)]
*  it could have been a real home [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3086.58s)]
*  but I think like it's a good, like 10 years [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3088.58s)]
*  is the right window because like [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3090.58s)]
*  basically since then, I mean really kind of since [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3092.58s)]
*  Bernie and the generational [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3094.58s)]
*  kind of like, like the fact [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3096.58s)]
*  that this is such a generationally defined [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3098.58s)]
*  thing has opened up. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3100.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like it's [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3102.58s)]
*  you can see the person holding that sign [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3104.58s)]
*  in gray hair. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3106.58s)]
*  It's like the [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3108.58s)]
*  attitude has shifted as this generation [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3110.58s)]
*  has kind of come in to be like [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3112.58s)]

*  We're dangerously close in proximity to [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3682.58s)]
*  Baltimore right now. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3684.58s)]
*  How's it going? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3686.58s)]
*  Hot. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3688.58s)]
*  It is. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3690.58s)]
*  How small are you? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3692.58s)]
*  Yeah, his head is real tiny. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3694.58s)]
*  He is actually. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3696.58s)]
*  It's so small. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3698.58s)]
*  I always thought it was just angles and [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3700.58s)]
*  everything, but it's very small. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3702.58s)]
*  Really small head. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3704.58s)]
*  Small head. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3706.58s)]
*  Everybody agrees here in person. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3708.58s)]
*  It's good. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3710.58s)]
*  I'm one of... [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3712.58s)]
*  I started watching you a few months ago [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3714.58s)]
*  when you were doing the Lebanon Pager thing. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3716.58s)]
*  The what? The Lebanon Pager attack. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3718.58s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3720.58s)]
*  Yeah, my first actual exposure [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3722.58s)]
*  was through Willie Mack Show and I had a [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3724.58s)]
*  bad first impression. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3726.58s)]
*  There's one question I've always [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3728.58s)]
*  wanted to ask you though. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3730.58s)]
*  We got a Willie Slop fan. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3732.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3734.58s)]
*  Originally a hater. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3736.58s)]
*  Now a big laser. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3740.58s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3742.58s)]
*  It's all good. I mean that's how it goes. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3744.58s)]
*  I just want to ask you. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3746.58s)]
*  Obviously we all do our different forms of outreach work. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3748.58s)]
*  No, this is too much. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3750.58s)]
*  It's too much. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3752.58s)]
*  Me as a volunteer for a small [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3754.58s)]
*  coalition in New York. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3756.58s)]
*  We fire, we go talk to people. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3758.58s)]
*  Do you guys like this? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3760.58s)]
*  How do you discuss it with the fact that [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3762.58s)]
*  maybe one out of a hundred people [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3764.58s)]
*  will actually go out and do stuff like this. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3766.58s)]
*  Bro, it's [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3768.58s)]
*  still amazing. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3770.58s)]
*  I can't do it. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3772.58s)]
*  It takes a long time. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3774.58s)]
*  It takes a long time. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3776.58s)]
*  This is an unimaginable [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3778.58s)]
*  crowd for [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3780.58s)]
*  you know, if you look at like [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3782.58s)]
*  ten years in the past, if you look at a decade ago, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3784.58s)]
*  there would never be this many young [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3786.58s)]
*  people out talking about Palestine. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3788.58s)]
*  Personally my opinion is like [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3790.58s)]
*  with the whole team at the beginning, I feel like [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3792.58s)]
*  there's still not enough people on the streets. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3794.58s)]
*  I know. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3796.58s)]
*  We're working on it. We're going to fix it. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3798.58s)]
*  Hopefully. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3800.58s)]
*  I think a part of that is [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3802.58s)]
*  because liberals are not aware. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3804.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3806.58s)]
*  The direct failure of the Democratic Party. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3808.58s)]
*  But things are changing. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3810.58s)]
*  Even organizations [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3812.58s)]
*  that played a formative role [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3814.58s)]
*  in developing this [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3816.58s)]
*  deportation list and the kidnapping [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3818.58s)]
*  list like the ADL [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3820.58s)]
*  and numerous other [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3822.58s)]
*  like numerous other [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3824.58s)]
*  Israel organizations [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3826.58s)]
*  like pro-Israel organizations that masquerade as [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3828.58s)]
*  Jewish advocacy organizations [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3830.58s)]
*  are now kind of getting [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3832.58s)]
*  cold feet because they're realizing like [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3834.58s)]
*  this is only accelerating [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3836.58s)]
*  the anger and resentment people feel towards [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3838.58s)]
*  Israel. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3840.58s)]
*  So in a way [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3842.58s)]
*  it's always dark as before the dawn. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3844.58s)]
*  And [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3846.58s)]
*  all of the backlash [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3848.58s)]
*  I think will keep [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3850.58s)]
*  building momentum. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3852.58s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3854.58s)]
*  I think it also takes a long time. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3856.58s)]
*  Personally [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3858.58s)]
*  when I've been doing outreach, I think the biggest [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3860.58s)]
*  enemy to this sort of movement is [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3862.58s)]
*  people for what's it called [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3864.58s)]
*  indifference. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3866.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3868.58s)]
*  I think we can both agree that most people only care [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3870.58s)]
*  about themselves. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3872.58s)]
*  Especially Americans. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3874.58s)]
*  How do you [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3876.58s)]
*  maybe opt to [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3878.58s)]
*  get them less indiferent? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3880.58s)]
*  Because, well that's why [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3882.58s)]
*  when I think of Bernie for example [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3884.58s)]
*  I broach the subject matter from something [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3886.58s)]
*  that I know they care about. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3888.58s)]
*  I know he cares about personally, like First Amendment. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3890.58s)]
*  Free speech, that's something [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3892.58s)]
*  he cares about. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3894.58s)]
*  You can always find [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3896.58s)]
*  because [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3898.58s)]
*  the Palestinian [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3900.58s)]
*  issue is at the [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3902.58s)]
*  intersection of so many [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3904.58s)]
*  problems in the United States [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3906.58s)]
*  of America, both in the domestic [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3908.58s)]
*  tampering with free speech [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3910.58s)]

*  I know you two are like [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3914.58s)]
*  I don't know [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3916.58s)]
*  personally what I meant to say. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3918.58s)]
*  Why are you ruining my flow? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3920.58s)]
*  It's his fault! [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3922.58s)]
*  It's not my fault! [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3924.58s)]
*  He's looking handsome over here. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3926.58s)]
*  He was like, I know that guy. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3928.58s)]
*  What goes both sides of the issue like liberals, right? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3930.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3932.58s)]
*  As I was saying, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3934.58s)]
*  the due process [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3936.58s)]
*  thing, the erosion of due process, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3938.58s)]
*  kidnappings by ICE, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3940.58s)]
*  the violations of the [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3942.58s)]
*  First Amendment, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3944.58s)]
*  eroding the First Amendment, these are issues that [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3946.58s)]
*  every American cares about deep down inside. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3948.58s)]
*  So the onus is on us [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3950.58s)]
*  to be able to identify what they do care about [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3952.58s)]
*  and then tackle the subject [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3954.58s)]
*  matter from that perspective. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3956.58s)]
*  Another very common [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3958.58s)]
*  uniting factor, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3960.58s)]
*  uniting principle is [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3962.58s)]
*  every dollar given to Israel, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3964.58s)]
*  every one of your tax dollars given to Israel [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3966.58s)]
*  could actually be spent here [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3968.58s)]
*  on healthcare, could actually be spent [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3970.58s)]
*  here on the roads, could actually be spent [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3972.58s)]
*  on building our infrastructure. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3974.58s)]
*  So, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3976.58s)]
*  it's actually fairly easy to get [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3978.58s)]
*  Americans to recognize [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3980.58s)]
*  how unsustainable and insane it is. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3982.58s)]
*  I do have one question. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3984.58s)]
*  This might be a bit difficult for you to [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3986.58s)]
*  Also, your shoelace aren't tied. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3988.58s)]
*  This is my life. This is how I live. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3990.58s)]
*  But have you ever read the book Perfect Victims [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3992.58s)]
*  by Mohammed Al-Qurd? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3994.58s)]
*  No, I have not. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3996.58s)]
*  I don't recommend you read it, but he talks about how like, you know, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=3998.58s)]
*  sort of talking about [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4000.58s)]
*  oh, your tax dollars spend [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4002.58s)]
*  our killing, puts palestinian [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4004.58s)]
*  lives on the back, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4006.58s)]
*  on the back seat as opposed to like their interest. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4008.58s)]
*  No, I understand that this is [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4010.58s)]
*  overall [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4012.58s)]
*  a [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4014.58s)]
*  multifaceted effort. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4016.58s)]
*  Everyone has a different [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4018.58s)]
*  role to play. And I [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4020.58s)]
*  totally get that. I think it's important to [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4022.58s)]
*  recognize the humanity of palestinians because [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4024.58s)]
*  the dehumanization is what allows people to [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4026.58s)]
*  feel indifferent. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4028.58s)]
*  But also, America is a deeply, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4030.58s)]
*  deeply white supremacist nation. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4032.58s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4034.58s)]
*  And I will take any ally [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4036.58s)]
*  I can get, and I will take any opportunity [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4038.58s)]
*  I can get to communicate [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4040.58s)]
*  on this issue, on [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4042.58s)]
*  causes that they care about as [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4044.58s)]
*  an entry point. Because no one just starts off [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4046.58s)]
*  and goes, oh yeah, I don't like the [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4048.58s)]
*  way our taxes are being spent. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4050.58s)]
*  They investigate further. You just gotta open that [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4052.58s)]
*  door. No matter how you can [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4054.58s)]
*  open that door, it's good. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4056.58s)]
*  Find a way to make them care about it. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4058.58s)]
*  Find a way to make them inquisitive. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4060.58s)]
*  And then, send them along [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4062.58s)]
*  on this journey. As many [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4064.58s)]
*  people around us that have come here [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4066.58s)]
*  probably were oblivious to the reality [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4068.58s)]
*  in Gaza, maybe before [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4070.58s)]
*  October 7, even maybe after October 7, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4072.58s)]
*  and until recently. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4074.58s)]
*  So, I don't discount any initiative [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4076.58s)]
*  moving the needle in the right direction. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4078.58s)]
*  I think it's good to do that. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4080.58s)]
*  And yeah, that's why [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4082.58s)]
*  I do what I do, and I [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4084.58s)]
*  kinda stay out of, like, people [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4086.58s)]
*  There's people that criticize my tactics [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4090.58s)]
*  as well. Yeah. But I think [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4092.58s)]
*  I also watch Ben at Binado, but [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4094.58s)]
*  I feel like he's a little too harsh on you for that. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4096.58s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's all good. Like, cause I [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4098.58s)]
*  know he's, he's [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4100.58s)]
*  He is for Palestinian emancipation. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4102.58s)]
*  You think people, when they see me in person, they go [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4104.58s)]
*  So I don't care that we have a difference [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4106.58s)]
*  in tactics, a difference in methods. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4108.58s)]
*  Because I'm an American citizen, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4110.58s)]
*  I live in the United States of America, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4112.58s)]
*  I understand the overall culture of [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4114.58s)]
*  indifference here. Are you watched? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4116.58s)]
*  It's a very, yes, carefully [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4118.58s)]
*  crafted, multi-billion [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4120.58s)]
*  dollar propaganda machine [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4122.58s)]
*  that makes Americans indifferent [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4124.58s)]
*  to all the bloodshed. So I think [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4126.58s)]
*  we gotta [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4128.58s)]
*  tackle it differently. I don't wanna hug you [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4130.58s)]
*  too much. Can I take a picture with you? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4132.58s)]
*  Watch, watch. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4134.58s)]
*  I'm over here spinning, you guys are [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4136.58s)]
*  fucking around. What is this? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_OONWqZv4&t=4138.58s)]
