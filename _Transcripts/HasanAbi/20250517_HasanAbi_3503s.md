*  like that saying something like that in broad daylight in public [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=944.0s)]
*  would probably get you collapsed on. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=947.9s)]

*  and not worry at all. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=956.3s)]

*  breathe and live normal lives again in terms of pushing Israel [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1025.1000000000001s)]
*  to stop doing a genocide. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1028.8s)]
*  They did not they did not do that and they simply instead [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1032.3s)]
*  of doing that they simply went in line their pockets up and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1037.2s)]
*  then fucked off. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1044.2s)]
*  They also totally lied to the Hamas envoys and said nope, no [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1044.9s)]
*  deal for you. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1051.7s)]

*  I'll be honest the notion that Donald Trump is actually going [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1058.6000000000001s)]
*  to keep his previous obligations is so silly, especially [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1062.2s)]
*  when we are especially when we're thinking about the the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1069.1s)]
*  fact that when he was president the first time like what was [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1075.4s)]
*  his signature thing? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1078.4s)]
*  What did he do initially out of the gate? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1079.5s)]
*  He threw away the Iran denuclearization agreement, right? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1082.1s)]
*  So he is known as the guy who fucks up pre-established deals [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1086.1s)]
*  now, of course. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1090.8s)]
*  No, I'm not going to watch that dude. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1091.9s)]

*  Listen, please stop. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1095.9s)]
*  I know the Houthis made a cover song for a Vietnamese [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1098.0s)]
*  Revolutionary song. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1100.1s)]
*  I don't want to even entertain the notion of getting getting [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1101.6s)]
*  banned over some stupid shit. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1105.6s)]
*  Please open up your brain a little bit. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1107.3s)]
*  Okay, like it's great and it's wonderful. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1109.4s)]
*  But are you guys all stupid? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1114.0s)]
*  Have you drank the dumb juice like what's going on here? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1116.5s)]
*  It has nothing to do with whether or not this is appropriate [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1120.5s)]
*  for me to play on stream and everything to do with what [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1123.0s)]

*  Do you understand? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1137.8s)]
*  Anyway, no disrespect. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1138.9s)]
*  I know this is a cool and I'll look at it on my own time, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1140.7s)]
*  but you know, I can't do it on stream and all the people [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1146.1s)]
*  that are like no you got to watch this stop. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1150.1s)]
*  I know is a Viet chatter trying to have Vietnam mentioned [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1152.5s)]
*  on the outside of your stream. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1155.3s)]
*  We've already, you know, okay. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1156.2s)]
*  So as I was saying, where was I? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1158.2s)]
*  Oh, as far as like the Hamas envoys like they have nothing, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1161.2s)]
*  right? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1166.4s)]
*  The the the the people that are within the the people that [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1167.0s)]
*  are in Hamas. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1174.8s)]
*  They have nothing. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1176.6000000000001s)]
*  This was a last ditch. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1177.3s)]
*  Hail Mary effort. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1178.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's all this was is all this was for them with [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1180.1000000000001s)]
*  the with the false hope that Donald Trump will react like [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1184.3s)]
*  a normal human being. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1188.6s)]
*  Maybe he's too annoyed by Benjamin Netanyahu and maybe [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1189.6s)]
*  they will turn around and maybe they will turn around and [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1193.6s)]
*  potentially cut a deal to implement a ceasefire. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1199.1s)]
*  But Trump obviously has no respect for Muslims in general, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1203.8999999999999s)]
*  especially Muslims who are vulnerable and don't have [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1208.5s)]
*  anything. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1211.8999999999999s)]
*  If a mosque had a better position overall militarily against [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1213.0s)]
*  Israel, I think Trump would be more willing to listen if if [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1216.8s)]
*  if Palestinians had more natural resources that they could [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1222.5s)]
*  offer to the United States. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1227.4s)]
*  He's a dealmaker and that in the sense that like he's just [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1229.1s)]
*  a selfish piece of shit, right then there could potentially [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1231.8s)]
*  be some considerations for their position. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1236.6s)]
*  But as it stands, they are a totally captive population that [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1240.0s)]
*  is being ethnically cleansed by Israel America's greatest [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1244.0s)]
*  ally and also he recognizes that even do you dislike [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1248.0s)]
*  Israelis not all Israelis but anyone who defends Israel's [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1252.7s)]
*  actions. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1256.9s)]
*  Yes, I dislike them. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1257.4s)]
*  I think they're gross. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1259.3s)]
*  It's it's like asking me would I like you know Germans during [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1260.4s)]
*  the Nazi rain? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1264.7s)]
*  I would not. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1266.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1268.5s)]
*  Yes, fuck Israel Israel can suck my dick. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1269.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1273.0s)]
*  Anyway, and those who defend Israel can also suck my dick. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1274.1s)]
*  So as I was saying, this was a last ditch effort from Hamas [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1280.3s)]
*  and it did not work. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1286.6999999999998s)]
*  It did not work out and the reason why it did not work out [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1288.3s)]
*  is because Donald Trump is a horrible monster just as Joe [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1291.8s)]
*  Biden was a horrible monster. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1296.3s)]
*  The only difference here. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1299.3999999999999s)]
*  The only difference here is that Donald Trump is willing to [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1302.0s)]
*  sometimes embarrass the Israelis as opposed to as opposed [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1305.6s)]
*  to Joe Biden who was terrified of the prospect doors open [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1311.3999999999999s)]

*  what Israel is doing is so fucking cooked. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1590.3s)]

*  Why are you all triggered by a flag? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1599.3s)]
*  Because what Israel has done is a genocide while also Israel [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1601.4s)]

*  and on a good day when it's not doing a genocide. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1635.0s)]
*  It's still an apartheid. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=1637.6s)]

*  Okay. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2355.0s)]

*  state which also is anti-Christian as well. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2372.2s)]
*  There's still a fuck ton of mosques all around China as well. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2377.7999999999997s)]
*  There's like Chinese Muslims all around as Xinjiang either. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2381.0s)]
*  This isn't propaganda that is defensive of the Chinese state. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2384.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm just telling you exactly what it is as long as you are [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2388.2999999999997s)]

*  The the the Chinese government lets you practice your religion, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2396.0s)]

*  all. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2407.5s)]
*  They are very anti-religion and it doesn't just mean against [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2407.8s)]
*  Islam either. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2412.2000000000003s)]
*  It's it's Christianity to like Xi Jinping recently banned [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2412.8s)]
*  missionary work in China. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2416.7000000000003s)]

*  Where were we? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2423.5s)]
*  More than two months and James you're why are we on China's [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2425.1s)]
*  flaws right now? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2428.7000000000003s)]
*  We were covering Gaza two minutes ago. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2429.4s)]
*  The reason why I was talking about that is because I was [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2431.4s)]
*  talking about China's flaws specifically on on on Palestine. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2433.1s)]
*  That's it. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2438.0s)]
*  Like that's literally the reason why we're talking about China [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2438.7000000000003s)]
*  because I briefly brought up because the chatter asked me [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2440.7000000000003s)]
*  like what is China's involvement in terms of like defending [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2444.4s)]
*  the Palestinians and and I told them that like China overall [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2448.3s)]
*  is is not as pro-Palestine as they present themselves to be [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2454.7000000000003s)]
*  but having said that they certainly are nowhere near as [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2459.6s)]
*  bad as like even Turkey is in terms of direct material support [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2463.8s)]
*  like Turkey has a shit ton more power over Israel power that [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2469.0s)]
*  it refuses to enforce pressure that it refuses to apply to [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2474.7000000000003s)]
*  Israel. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2478.8s)]
*  Turkey could shut off the energy grid of Israel tomorrow [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2480.3s)]
*  yesterday whenever it wants to but of course it will never [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2484.6s)]
*  do that right. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2488.0s)]
*  So when Adon says like oh fuck Israel, whatever that's entirely [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2490.3s)]
*  different now China could China could also implement a blockade [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2494.4s)]
*  of sharing technology with Israel or or being a large [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2501.8s)]
*  trading partner to Israel. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2505.9s)]
*  But from what I understand and there's not a lot of great [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2507.2s)]
*  reporting on this American technology makes its way to China [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2509.2s)]
*  by way of Israel due to this due to this major due to this [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2513.5s)]
*  like major trading partner status that China has with Israel. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2520.2s)]
*  So Israel has been helpful for Chinese security interests in [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2523.7999999999997s)]
*  the past at least as far as I read on the matter Israel will [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2530.1s)]
*  sometimes literally give American weapons that they're [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2533.9s)]
*  not supposed to to China as a part of this trade relationship [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2537.4s)]
*  allowing China to have access to the technology allowing China [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2541.9s)]

*  normally would be effectively blocked out of of purchasing [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2554.3s)]
*  or even dismantling and and learning about so yeah, Israel [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2558.1s)]

*  in terms of negotiations. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2814.9s)]
*  The fact is international law of which Israel is a signatory [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2817.1s)]

*  Those things are very very clear. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2829.2s)]

*  Assuming China is always lying about what it's doing such a [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2881.7000000000003s)]
*  US-China watcher perversion. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2883.9s)]

*  what China is doing and what China is not doing and that is [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2893.9s)]

*  that are far more responsible for the bombing and starvation [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2900.1s)]

*  And what did they do with all of their involvement? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2923.1s)]
*  They don't use any real mechanisms of pressure. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=2926.2999999999997s)]

*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised is [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlzrWohmoYE&t=3164.0s)]
