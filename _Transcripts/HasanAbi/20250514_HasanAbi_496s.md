# Hasan Piker On The Daily Show | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI)
*  we do that. I crack way more jokes on that one. I mean, this is a very, we, we talked [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=0.0s)]
*  for like an hour, I would say, but of course it's supposed to be bite-sized for, for, for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=7.48s)]
*  the TV. You know, they put your bangers in there though. No, I had, I had some other [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  bangers too. I was ripping into Jordan was clever as chill to hang as he seems he'd be. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=20.68s)]
*  Yeah. He was a chill hang. Speaking of positive coverage, let's get to Hassan piker, progressive [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=24.92s)]
*  king at Twitch and vice Jordan clever into the manuscript. Now this initial, the original [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=36.24s)]
*  title for this video was Hassan piker liberal king of Twitch to which I responded with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  liberal. And they changed it to progressive since then they called me the liberal king. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=46.56s)]
*  Is there a longer version? Five minutes seems a bit short. I think there is a longer, this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=58.74s)]
*  is not, this hasn't been televised yet. So this is like a sneak preview. And I don't [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=63.56s)]
*  version is going, going to be going to feature me for a longer time. But this is just the, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=69.4s)]
*  the brief version. Maybe it was, Oh, it was televised yesterday. Oh, it was on TV. Okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=84.12s)]
*  Well anyway, let's watch. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=89.0s)]
*  Common knowledge that the podcast world is full of Maga right-wingers, but the left has [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=91.0s)]
*  some big players too. I spoke to one of their biggest after 10 years of covering the Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=96.64s)]
*  campaign. I thought nothing could shock me anymore, but somehow in 2024 young voters [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=101.72s)]
*  and most especially young men went hard for a 78 year old who uses pancake makeup. The [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=106.92s)]
*  bro vote, especially on college campuses broke heavily for Trump by engaging with right-wing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=112.56s)]
*  influencers in what's called the Mano sphere. It's a collection of online content and social [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=117.64s)]
*  media promoting bro culture. And it's a space that the left seems to ignore, but someone saw [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=122.34s)]
*  this as a mistake. Were you surprised that so many young people showed up and voted for Donald [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=128.82s)]
*  Trump? No, not even a little bit. This is a son piker. He's a progressive who has intellectual [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=134.02s)]
*  sit downs with Bernie and AOC and still manages to post thirst trap workout videos to his 2.8 [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=140.06s)]
*  million followers on the platform Twitch. This combo has liberal media asking if he is the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=145.74s)]
*  magical connection to young male voters. This is where you Twitch from. Yeah. What is a Twitch? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=152.18s)]
*  It's basically like YouTube, but you're live streaming. It's a podcast for people who are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  like, I wish this podcast were longer. Yeah. Yet his lefty bona fides might have made him a target [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=161.58s)]
*  for Donald Trump's Homeland security, which recently detained piker at the airport. How do [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=167.82s)]
*  you see the left communicating with like young men in this, this time of the Mano sphere? The [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=172.46s)]
*  left could, I don't know, talk to dudes without vilifying them. There's a lot of anger, resentment, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=178.72s)]
*  not having any hope for a future, never being able to retire, never being able to own a home. All of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=184.16s)]
*  those things are very much of the core identity for the next generation. But is there room for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=190.12s)]
*  the Democrats to create a left wing Mano sphere to talk about the social safety net and protein [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=196.52s)]
*  powder? Absolutely. I think that there is a space for it, but I don't think the left fills that void [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=202.16s)]
*  at all at this moment. I try to do so, but even I sometimes get hit with a this is body. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=208.52s)]
*  Now I have to worry about a new fascism? I'm just getting used to the old. What does even the term [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=215.56s)]
*  body mean? What would you? I don't fully understand it. I think it's like a lot of leftists hate other [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=220.68s)]
*  leftists. Any sort of consideration about the aesthetics of how you look is actually another [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  way to, I guess, reinforce an unjustifiable hierarchy. To be fair, that's why I don't work out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because I'm anti body. So people are like, Oh, are you lazy? I'm like, No, I'm, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=236.28s)]
*  I'm a socialist with my body. Yeah, no respect. Yeah. And it's not young men just being drawn [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=240.28s)]
*  to the right. Some technology is giving them a push. A recent study created generic TikTok [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=245.64s)]
*  accounts for imaginary 16 to 18 year old boys to see how the algorithm acted. And within 23 minutes, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  they were fed masculine anti feminist extremist content. Life for a man is harder than life for a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=258.2s)]
*  woman. The hotter a woman is, the more insecure she is about her looks. Your body, my choice. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=263.32s)]
*  So I was excited to dip my toe into this cesspool. So I set up this account as a 16 year old [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=269.4s)]
*  pretending that's what the hunters do as well. I'm not in the stuff we see here. So this is this is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=276.04s)]
*  a what my algorithm is essentially feeling. First up some content from Charlie Kirk. Kirk is a right [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=280.92s)]
*  wing influencer known for trolling liberals on college campuses. You said male baristas [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=286.68s)]
*  are masculine. Thank you. And I can both agree that male baristas are not exactly high, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=292.12s)]
*  usually high on the testosterone. They are just a little positive for a second. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=296.6s)]
*  But he's a podcaster. He's a podcaster. We are doing something very, very not like alpha dog. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=301.56s)]
*  They mistake being confident for what it means to be masculine. Okay, moving on. Travonta Davis. He's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  six. Okay, I'm seeing your algorithm. May I gently bury my face in those milkers? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=316.12s)]
*  This dog. See, there's just so. Burgles. Thank you for the 50 bones. God damn. So much going on here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=323.72s)]
*  Is this dog going to f*** a woman? Is that what's happening here? I don't know what's going on. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=330.04s)]
*  Who am I? And I don't know. Who are you, Jordan? This is this is TikTok makes me very existential. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=333.4s)]
*  I'm gonna like it. I'm gonna smash that heart. What are these trucks? What is going on? I like [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=339.0s)]
*  this one though. This is interesting. Me, cheap. The only thing I do behind your back is look at [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=345.56s)]
*  your ass. See, this is actually kind of sweet. But it's like, why is it always trucks? You get [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=349.72s)]
*  you get dogs that objectify women and also trucks that objectify women. Yeah. Are you a sea lion? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=354.04s)]
*  Because I would like to see you lying in my bed, sweetie. No, no, this is I'm telling you this is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=359.24s)]
*  for how old are you? I'm 46. Yeah, this is literally the TikTok algorithm. I think at some point [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=363.48s)]
*  identified you as a 46 year old man. But you can tell that because it's a dog that wants to f*** me. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=370.04s)]
*  This is one like even the first dog one. It knows why it found me that now you understand how people [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=375.32s)]
*  find themselves captivated by right wing politics. Oh my god. Yeah, it was like, oh, a lot of people [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=380.76s)]
*  are like emotionally and mentally stunted adults. Yes. Running around. And that's why they think [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=385.96s)]
*  entretates awesome. I think we're arriving at how that happened. In the end, young people just want [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=390.84s)]
*  influencers who could act to address their concerns and social media that doesn't break their brains. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=396.12s)]
*  Oh, like keep scrolling through to see if there's any more dogs that want to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=400.68s)]
*  have dogs. I want to pet. Yeah. Thank you. And for more about the rise of young Trump fan [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=404.20000000000005s)]
*  take a minute special. The next generation. Every next we do not crack way more jokes on that one. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=409.32000000000005s)]
*  Damn. I mean, this is a very, we talked for like an hour, I would say, but of course it's supposed [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=417.24s)]
*  to be bite-sized for, for, for the TV, you know, they put your bangers in there though. No, I had, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=424.12s)]
*  I had some other bangers too. I was ripping into Jordan was clever as chill to hang as he seems. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=432.52s)]
*  He'd be, yeah, he was a chill hang bro. Didn't know you got some funny in you disclosure, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=436.92s)]
*  not pay chatter. Okay. Then I feel like seeing that angle of the desk is forbidden knowledge. Yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. It is. Cause it doesn't look that good. Cause it's not everything that you see is the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=446.68s)]
*  set basically. And everything you don't see, I don't really care to like create a visual space. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  Like I don't care about that. I don't care about the aesthetics of what it looks like off camera. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=463.08s)]
*  You know, you lie to us and made us think the room was much bigger. It is pretty big. I know [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=468.84s)]
*  your haters are seething and coping, bro. I mean, I don't care. It is what it is. You got to do what [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=473.48s)]
*  you got to do from your first interview one-on-one with a Trump supporter. Yeah. Very different now. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=481.08000000000004s)]
*  Very different type of interview now. Cause I've, I've gone through my political journey, I guess. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47M8IlqwhI&t=486.36s)]
