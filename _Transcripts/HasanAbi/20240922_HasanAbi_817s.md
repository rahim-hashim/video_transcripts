# Hasan Tries QTCinderella's Cookies!
**HasanAbi:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks)
*  Okay, final verdict. A little salty but I like it. The harmony of sweet delicious chocolate chip [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=0.0s)]
*  and the saltiness, the savoriness of the salt work in perfect harmony. I'm gonna say, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=7.76s)]
*  despite the fact that it's cold because it was in a fridge, that's an eight out of ten. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=14.16s)]

*  No, wait. No, you better get some for your crew. Do we have a bag? Does anyone have an extra bag [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  that they're not using? How big a bag? Like a baggie bag to put some cookies into. No, I'm standing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=129.12s)]

*  All right. Perfect. Perfect place for me to hide for a second and eat my cookie. Oh, oh, oh. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=306.64s)]
*  Okay. I did it. Thank you. No, no, it's fine. Just gonna drop this milk over here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=312.96s)]
*  I don't want to put the cookie down because it's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=322.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=327.44s)]
*  What's up everybody? We're doing, that's how the cookie crumbles. This is a new segment [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=330.56s)]
*  I just came up with on the spot in this very moment. Call me Keith Lee the way I'm actually [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  going to be testing out these cookies. Now these are obviously cutie Cinderella's cookies. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=344.0s)]
*  Okay. So I'm a little partial here. I'm going to be a little biased obviously, but, uh, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=349.76s)]
*  right off the start, very friendly, very friendly establishment. Institution was kind [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=357.76s)]
*  to everyone but me, but I guess that's because, you know, uh, it's a family friendly establishment [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=364.8s)]
*  and, uh, they didn't really put me like that. It's all good. Okay. It is what it is. You know [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=371.52s)]
*  what I'm saying? Okay. All right. We got two cookies. They were free 99 because it's a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=377.36s)]
*  sponsored event by big milk. The first one I'm going to try is the chocolate chip cookie that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=390.72s)]
*  is salted. Okay. Love that. Love a good salt on my chocolate chip cookie. Call me the Costco guys. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=397.44000000000005s)]
*  The way I'm eating double chocolate chip cookie. I'm gonna give these a couple booms as well, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  even though I'm doing a Keith Lee style situation here. Let's go. Let's, let's take a look. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=408.24s)]
*  Okay. It's kind of cold [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=412.8s)]
*  and I think that's because it was in the fridge, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=423.68s)]
*  but it's still got a little doughy consistency to it. Just by being cold. I'm being on the fridge. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=427.44s)]
*  Still pretty good. All right. We got to try it with the milk. I'm a big milk fan. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm a big milk boy. As you guys know, no sponsor, no nothing. Okay. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=443.68s)]
*  I just straight up love milk. Let me open this bad boy up, pop the top, try it with a little bit of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=450.08s)]
*  milk. I'm good. Thank you. Um, would have appreciated it more. I think if the cookie was warm, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=457.76s)]
*  no, I'm good. I don't need to take a photo with the milk man is trying to get a photo with me. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=472.0s)]
*  Okay. Final verdict. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=480.8s)]
*  A little salty, but I like it. The harmony of sweet, delicious chocolate chip [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  and the, and the saltiness, the savoriness of the salt work in perfect harmony. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=497.44s)]
*  I'm going to say, despite the fact that it's cold because it was in a fridge, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=504.24s)]
*  that's an eight out of 10. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  Now let's move on to another one of my favorite type of cookies. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=515.84s)]
*  The snickerdoodle cookie. Now a lot of people, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=519.92s)]
*  a lot of people might not be, I mean, a seven out of 10, by the way, is a, is a five boom cookie. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=522.88s)]
*  Cause that in terms of like the Costco guys, I'm doing a, I'm doing Keith Lee style right now, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=529.84s)]
*  but in terms of Costco guys is a double trunk chocolate cookie, five booms, boom, boom, boom, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=534.24s)]
*  boom, boom. But like, that's not what we're doing here. We're doing a more professional style cookie [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=540.32s)]
*  eating. Um, so second cookie I have right here up next is a snickerdoodle cookie. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  Second cookie I have right here up next is a snickerdoodle cookie. I'm actually a big fan [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=549.92s)]
*  of snickerdoodle cookies. Most people don't really, um, most, I feel like most people don't [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=553.92s)]
*  really put snickerdoodle cookies. Like, I don't know why it's a usually a hit, never really a miss. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=558.8s)]
*  Great consistency. Just the perfect amount of cinnamon. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=574.4s)]
*  This one, seemingly a little bit warmer, I would say. Still definitely was in the fridge, but [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=579.76s)]
*  it's not as hardened in the same way that the chocolate was. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  Chocolate chip one, the chocolate chips were a little too hard. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=599.52s)]
*  The little sugar on top, beautiful. That's a nine out of ten cookie. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=601.76s)]
*  Also, five booms, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I think I did four, boom. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=617.76s)]
*  I lost count. But yeah, that was excellent. Um, I'm almost late to my, I'm actually, um, almost late to my [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=626.48s)]
*  podcast that I'll be, that'll be taping before QD even gets to my podcast. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=643.12s)]
*  Before QD even gets to my podcast, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  because I gave six booms. Well, the snickerdoodle deserves honestly. But yeah, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=654.32s)]
*  excellent. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=663.6s)]
*  We are going to be taping the beer on podcast right now. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=667.6s)]
*  I'm not entirely sure where, not entirely sure how, but we're going to do the dang thing. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=672.0s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=683.36s)]
*  Let me tell you folks, this morning when I woke up, I was pissed off [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=689.12s)]
*  because Austin and Will had to stay in San Diego. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=697.76s)]
*  Even though QD's last obligation here is that like, you know, supposed to end at five. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=704.56s)]
*  I wanted to film the podcast in Los Angeles and I wanted to live react to my CNN appearance. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=708.88s)]
*  CNN appearance. However, Maya and DLV's crew saved the day. This would have been [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=718.16s)]
*  another regular Ascenday stream. But instead, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=730.88s)]
*  but instead we made it something special. We made it something beautiful. We went [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  and we went and we did one of my favorite activities of all time, which is go and see [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=744.4s)]
*  animals, animals in the wild, animals in their safe space, just being cool, kicking it, kicking [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=752.32s)]
*  back. We saw hippopotamus. Hippopotamuses, hippopotami. I don't know, but anyway, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=760.72s)]
*  I don't know. But anyway, it was incredible. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=770.88s)]
*  I loved it and I'm glad that I could share this experience with you guys and I hope you guys [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=777.92s)]
*  appreciate it and enjoyed the show as well. That'll be all for me because I am supposed to go back and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=783.68s)]
*  tape this podcast even before QD gets there. So, love you all. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=795.12s)]
*  And that's it for me. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=801.04s)]
*  Hope you guys enjoyed it. See you tomorrow. Back to regular old news. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=808.3199999999999s)]
*  We'll react to the CNN thing that's like literally happening in the next five minutes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjiGG_CKCks&t=812.0s)]
