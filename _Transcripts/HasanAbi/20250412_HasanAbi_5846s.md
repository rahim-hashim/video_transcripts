*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1093.42s)]
*  I have all access. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1095.42s)]
*  You just cover long enough, someone will recognize you. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1097.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, she has it. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1099.42s)]
*  I know who you are. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1101.42s)]
*  Isabel and Annie are sort of like overseeing this. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1103.42s)]
*  I'm just pressed by... [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1105.42s)]
*  Let me... [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1107.42s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1109.42s)]
*  You're the one on one right now? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1111.42s)]
*  No, we were just... we were going to walk them up from Mia's team, but I had to go pee. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1113.42s)]
*  Fair. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1115.42s)]
*  Absolutely fair. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1117.42s)]
*  Okay, yeah, I can let you back. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1119.42s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1121.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1123.42s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1129.42s)]
*  Hello. Of course. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1131.42s)]
*  I told... [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1133.42s)]
*  I work for Rokana and Bernie. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1135.42s)]
*  You're also live by the way, just so you know. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1137.42s)]
*  I was like, if I meet Hasan, I'm stopping my work. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1139.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1141.42s)]
*  No, it's valid. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1143.42s)]
*  Hello, hi, what? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1145.42s)]
*  You're amazing, keep doing what you do. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1147.42s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1149.42s)]
*  That's all you do with crowd, too. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1151.42s)]
*  Alright, so I guess this is like the limited backstage area. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1163.42s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1165.42s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1167.42s)]
*  I work with Rokana, I do HD. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1169.42s)]
*  Oh, nice to meet you. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1171.42s)]
*  Is he here? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1173.42s)]
*  We can talk to him, what's going on? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1175.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, I remember. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1177.42s)]
*  Here, what's up? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1179.42s)]
*  I'm live right now, by the way. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1181.42s)]
*  You want to talk to the stream? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1183.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just here supporting the fight against fascism and oligarchy. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1185.42s)]
*  And so I represent Nashville in the legislature in the south. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1187.42s)]
*  And we know that in the south we have the system of plantation politics we're still fighting against. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1189.42s)]
*  And so the young guys got kicked out in 2023 for protesting, but we're continuing to engage in good trouble. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1191.42s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1193.42s)]
*  What do you... [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1195.42s)]
*  Does this feel... [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1197.42s)]
*  Does this give you a little bit of enthusiasm seeing so many people out here? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1199.42s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of enthusiasm seeing so many people out here. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1201.42s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of enthusiasm seeing so many people out here. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1203.42s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of enthusiasm seeing so many people out here. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1205.42s)]
*  I think it's powerful. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1207.42s)]
*  I mean, coming together to say that this is not normal is going on right now. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1209.42s)]
*  I mean, coming together to say that this is not normal is going on right now. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1211.42s)]
*  And to see it's a multiracial, multigenerational coalition. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1213.42s)]
*  And to see it's a multiracial, multigenerational coalition. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1215.42s)]
*  So it gives a little bit of encouragement. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1217.42s)]
*  I came from Tennessee, did an event at Coachella about activism. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1219.42s)]
*  That's why we drove over with Maxwell Frost over here to support the rally. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1221.42s)]
*  Oh, you guys have something going on at Coachella as well? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1223.42s)]
*  Yesterday, we did a panel about grassroots organizing. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1225.42s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1227.42s)]
*  We have to go to unexpected places. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1229.42s)]
*  I think that's going to music festivals, going to places, meeting people where they are. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1231.42s)]
*  I think that's going to music festivals, going to places, meeting people where they are. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1233.42s)]
*  Did you see anybody at Coachella while you were there? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1235.42s)]
*  L'Oreal, Lady Gaga. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1237.42s)]
*  Okay, that's cool. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1239.42s)]
*  Was it good? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1241.42s)]
*  It was good. When are you going to run, brother? We've got to get you. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1243.42s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1245.42s)]
*  I feel like I have utility doing this more than anything else. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1247.42s)]
*  I feel like I have utility doing this more than anything else. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1251.42s)]
*  Well, thank you for keeping people informed more than the corporate media. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1253.42s)]
*  You tell the truth and you say things that need to be said and are not worried about being censored or the consequence. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1255.42s)]

*  But you've just got to shine a light on truth on what's happening right now. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1261.42s)]
*  What do you feel are some of the inefficiencies that you're seeing from the Democratic Party right now? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1263.42s)]
*  What do you feel are some of the inefficiencies that you're seeing from the Democratic Party right now? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1265.42s)]

*  I think we're not recognizing the urgency of this moment. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1269.42s)]
*  I think we're not recognizing the urgency of this moment. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1271.42s)]
*  I think people are still trying to play patty cake and make friends with fascists. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1273.42s)]
*  I think people are still trying to play patty cake and make friends with fascists. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1275.42s)]
*  And we have to recognize that these are not folks who have our best interests. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1277.42s)]
*  And we have to recognize that these are not folks who have our best interests. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1279.42s)]
*  There's no way to find moderation with people who want to destroy this nation and destroy people of color, destroy people who are trans, destroy immigrants. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1281.42s)]
*  There's no common ground. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1283.42s)]
*  There's no common ground. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1285.42s)]
*  And so we have to recognize that there's urgency and that we have to fight. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1287.42s)]
*  And so we have to recognize that there's urgency and that we have to fight. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1289.42s)]
*  We can't be afraid to fight back. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1291.42s)]
*  And that means civility is not always the way. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1293.42s)]
*  And that means civility is not always the way. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1295.42s)]
*  Deform is not always the way. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1297.42s)]
*  Sometimes democracy requires disruption. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1299.42s)]
*  And that's what we need right now. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1301.42s)]
*  Thanks a lot, man. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1303.42s)]
*  Can I take a picture with you? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1305.42s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1307.42s)]
*  What's up? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1309.42s)]
*  Thanks, brother. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1311.42s)]

*  Son Piker, can I get a quick photo with you? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1319.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1321.42s)]
*  I'm the executive director of Progressive Democrats of America. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1323.42s)]
*  Oh, nice to meet you. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1325.42s)]
*  Nice to meet you. How are you doing? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1327.42s)]
*  You're live, by the way. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1329.42s)]
*  You're live right now. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1331.42s)]
*  Oh, I am great. Well, you know, on behalf of the young Progressive Democrats of America, I'm here with your hero, Son Piker. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1333.42s)]
*  Oh, so... [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1335.42s)]
*  You've been in touch with some of our steering committees from YPDA. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1337.42s)]
*  I'd love to tell you what we do. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1339.42s)]
*  We're the organization that drafted Bernie Sanders to run for president as a Democrat. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1341.42s)]
*  Back before Sanders ran in 2016, we were the big fish in the small pond of electoral left politics. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1345.42s)]
*  And now we're one of the major national mass membership organizations. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1353.42s)]
*  We're on the far left wing of the Democratic Party, Democratic Socialists, Social Democratic. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1357.42s)]
*  But man, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the contemporary Democratic Party more than mine, because I hear mine all the time. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1361.42s)]
*  I say mine all the time. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1363.42s)]
*  They know my thoughts on the contemporary Democratic Party. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1365.42s)]
*  It's always a day late and a dollar short at a time when there's no time to waste. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1369.42s)]
*  Don't you think the base of the party, though, supports the Sanders platform? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1375.42s)]
*  I do. Yes, I think so. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1377.42s)]
*  So it's the money power that controls the... [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1379.42s)]
*  I still think, like, even the Sanders platform doesn't go far enough. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1381.42s)]
*  And by my estimation, but I think the base of the party is the party that supports the Sanders platform. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1385.42s)]
*  I think that at least he's trying to claw back some of that podium away from the Democratic Party in the appropriate direction. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1387.42s)]
*  And that's a good thing overall. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1391.42s)]
*  And it clearly is something that people are responsive to. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1393.42s)]
*  So every time I go to one of these things and I see these massive crowds, I'm very excited. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1399.42s)]
*  To your audience, don't forget, we're in a situation where, by the way, a lot of people are going to vote for you. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1405.42s)]

*  So the question is, is the Democratic Party the vehicle or the barrier? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1443.42s)]
*  It was the vehicle in FDR's time. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1447.42s)]
*  And if it is the vehicle, because I think we need unity, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1449.42s)]
*  therefore we're not going to see third-partyism because no one's going to start a third party [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1453.42s)]
*  because no one will vote against the fascists. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1457.42s)]
*  We need unity to defeat the fascists. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1459.42s)]
*  But we've got to make that vehicle of unity what the people want. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1461.42s)]
*  Or it will be gaslighting and it will lose. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1463.42s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1465.42s)]

*  in Los Angeles right now? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1517.42s)]
*  Right now there's so many lawsuits [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1519.42s)]
*  in the city of LA. We're facing a $1 billion [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1521.42s)]
*  budget deficit. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1523.42s)]
*  $320 million this fiscal year [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1525.42s)]
*  is spent on lawsuits, a lot of it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1527.42s)]
*  The top part is police, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1529.42s)]
*  next there are the dangerous roads [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1531.42s)]
*  and stuff like that, but too many lawsuits [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1533.42s)]
*  and not a lot of revenue coming in on our tax dollars. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1535.42s)]
*  I always tell people, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1537.42s)]
*  I always tell folks that are watching, that are listening, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1539.42s)]
*  like listen, if you're pissed off [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1541.42s)]
*  about your potholes, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1543.42s)]
*  if you're pissed off about the shitty infrastructure, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1545.42s)]
*  if you're pissed off about [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1547.42s)]
*  the social safety-ness that the city [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1549.42s)]
*  used to provide, lack of adequate [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1551.42s)]
*  public transit, even homelessness, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1553.42s)]
*  a big part of that is because [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1555.42s)]
*  our local budgets are unfortunately [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1557.42s)]
*  designed to constantly [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1559.42s)]
*  go to the police, and then also [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1561.42s)]
*  the additional expenses [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1563.42s)]
*  are also going to the police in terms [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1565.42s)]
*  of lawsuits that [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1567.42s)]
*  the city has to pay out [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1569.42s)]
*  back to the taxpayers when the cops inevitably [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1571.42s)]
*  do things that nobody likes. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1573.42s)]
*  Yep, and what happens is when they [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1575.42s)]
*  overspend, they have to cut or take the money [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1577.42s)]
*  from another department, and so that's what they're [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1579.42s)]
*  looking at, because of this $1 billion budget [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1581.42s)]
*  deficit, the city's looking to cut [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1583.42s)]
*  thousands of jobs. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1585.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1587.42s)]
*  If you all pay attention, April 21st [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1589.42s)]
*  that's when the City of LA budget drops, pay attention, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1591.42s)]
*  and we'll be telling everyone where the budget [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1593.42s)]
*  drops, and maybe we can do something when it drops so we can let [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1595.42s)]
*  everyone know where the money's going. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1597.42s)]

*  unconstitutional actions that they're engaging [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1771.42s)]
*  in. I [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1773.42s)]
*  think aside from [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1775.42s)]
*  protesting, which is great, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1777.42s)]
*  what are some of the tangible things that people [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1779.42s)]
*  can do? Show up in red districts [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1781.42s)]
*  and I've been on this town hall tour. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1783.42s)]
*  A thousand people in rural California [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1785.42s)]
*  going to Nebraska, Pennsylvania [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1787.42s)]
*  because we can get [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1789.42s)]
*  Republicans in these swing districts [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1791.42s)]
*  to start to speak out. They are. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1793.42s)]
*  Josh Hawley called Trump and said [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1795.42s)]
*  I can't go for any Medicaid cuts. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1797.42s)]
*  You got the Supreme Court now at least [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1799.42s)]
*  saying you can't just deport people [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1801.42s)]
*  without due process. You have people [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1803.42s)]
*  like Don Bacon speaking out against the [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1805.42s)]
*  tariffs. It's too few, but the more [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1807.42s)]
*  we mobilize, the more [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1809.42s)]
*  Republicans, some Republicans [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1811.42s)]
*  are going to start speaking out. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1813.42s)]
*  So the suggestion for people in [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1815.42s)]
*  red districts is to go out and [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1817.42s)]
*  show up. Show up on social media. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1819.42s)]
*  Show up at town halls. Show up [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1821.42s)]
*  at rallies. By the way, there are all these studies [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1823.42s)]
*  that show up. Five percent of the country's population [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1825.42s)]
*  marches and [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1827.42s)]
*  mobilizes. That's the biggest way [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1829.42s)]
*  to push back against [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1831.42s)]
*  authoritarian tendencies. We got there [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1833.42s)]
*  almost this past weekend. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1835.42s)]
*  Five million people. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1837.42s)]
*  So we have got to just [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1839.42s)]
*  continue to organize, show [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1841.42s)]
*  up, mobilize. Your voice [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1843.42s)]
*  matters. And it's making [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1845.42s)]
*  a difference. How is it making a difference? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1847.42s)]
*  We'll get the Supreme Court. We'll get [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1849.42s)]
*  them backing up Medicaid cuts in the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1851.42s)]
*  Senate. Alright. Well thank you, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=1853.42s)]

*  What's up, man? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2611.42s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2613.42s)]
*  A criminal found guilty of 34 felony [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2615.42s)]
*  counts of fraud. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2617.42s)]
*  Of course he is lying [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2619.42s)]
*  and manipulating the stock market too. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2621.42s)]
*  He is at his best [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2625.42s)]
*  making himself who back him and the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2627.42s)]
*  members of Congress who trade with him [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2629.42s)]
*  rich. Not you, not [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2631.42s)]
*  me, not the people. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2633.42s)]
*  And to be clear, I don't care [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2635.42s)]
*  what party you are, Democrat [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2637.42s)]
*  or Republican. I don't care [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2639.42s)]
*  what position one holds. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2641.42s)]
*  Members of Congress and elected officials [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2643.42s)]
*  holding and trading individual [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2645.42s)]
*  stock is wrong. It must [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2647.42s)]
*  end and we must ban it. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2649.42s)]
*  But I'll give you another example [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2655.42s)]
*  shocking and casual as it was [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2657.42s)]
*  when I was first elected. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2659.42s)]
*  Just this year [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2661.42s)]
*  I was elected, or I was named [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2663.42s)]
*  and appointed to the powerful [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2665.42s)]
*  energy and commerce committee. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2667.42s)]
*  This is one of the most powerful [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2669.42s)]
*  committees in all of Congress. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2671.42s)]
*  And for years lobbyists [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2673.42s)]
*  worked to keep me off this committee. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2675.42s)]
*  It oversees [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2677.42s)]
*  two thirds of the American economy. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2679.42s)]
*  Healthcare, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2681.42s)]
*  energy, technology, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2683.42s)]
*  trade. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2685.42s)]
*  As they say in Congress, if it moves [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2687.42s)]
*  its energy, if it doesn't, it's commerce. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2689.42s)]
*  And that's the jurisdiction of this committee. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2691.42s)]
*  And an interesting thing [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2693.42s)]
*  that happened was that [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2695.42s)]
*  the day I was named [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2697.42s)]
*  to this committee, the same [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2699.42s)]
*  day, my office's phones [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2701.42s)]
*  rang off the hook [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2703.42s)]
*  and our inboxes were flooded [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2705.42s)]
*  by every corporate [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2707.42s)]
*  lobbyist under the sun. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2709.42s)]
*  They all wanted to be [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2711.42s)]
*  my best friends. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2713.42s)]
*  But you know what, Los Angeles? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2715.42s)]
*  Because of your support, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2717.42s)]
*  because of you all showing up, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2719.42s)]
*  because I don't have to take [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2721.42s)]
*  a dime in corporate money, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2723.42s)]
*  you allow me to say no. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2725.42s)]
*  But not everyone is so lucky. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2731.42s)]
*  I have seen [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2733.42s)]
*  first hand how these [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2735.42s)]
*  groups bully and pressure [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2737.42s)]
*  members of Congress, threatening [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2739.42s)]
*  to either take money away [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2741.42s)]
*  or spend it against them if they [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2743.42s)]
*  don't do what they want. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2749.42s)]
*  And what they want is for our [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2751.42s)]
*  lives to be as expensive [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2753.42s)]
*  as possible on the lowest [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2755.42s)]
*  possible wage. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2757.42s)]
*  It all trickles down [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2759.42s)]
*  to how life feels for [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2761.42s)]
*  working people today. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2763.42s)]
*  These facts apply the feeling [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2765.42s)]
*  of the water rising up to [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2767.42s)]
*  our throats, the impossibility [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2769.42s)]
*  to afford anything easily, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2771.42s)]
*  the fear of speaking [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2773.42s)]
*  up, the deeply bitter [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2775.42s)]
*  and toxic division driven [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2777.42s)]
*  by social media [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2779.42s)]
*  and the crumbling [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2781.42s)]
*  of our rights and protections. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2783.42s)]
*  Understand that all [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2785.42s)]

*  by billionaires. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2793.42s)]
*  This is what oligarchy [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2795.42s)]
*  feels like. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2797.42s)]
*  And it only will get worse [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2799.42s)]
*  until we act. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2801.42s)]
*  It is this system that relies [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2803.42s)]
*  on division to legislate [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2805.42s)]

*  people of the country. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2809.42s)]
*  It is the party that has [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2811.42s)]
*  brought us the most corrupt [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2813.42s)]

*  sat behind him. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2859.42s)]
*  They have one central [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2861.42s)]

*  the United States of America. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=2865.42s)]

*  One accident, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3067.42s)]

*  like this anymore, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3077.42s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3079.42s)]
*  We can stand [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3081.42s)]
*  with one another and stand [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3083.42s)]
*  for ourselves. And [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3085.42s)]
*  we might come from different places, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3087.42s)]
*  but we share the same [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3089.42s)]
*  experiences. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3091.42s)]
*  So to all who came here today, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3093.42s)]
*  unsure of whether this [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3095.42s)]
*  is where you belong, I want [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3097.42s)]
*  to say that you do. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3099.42s)]

*  religion, gender identity, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3107.42s)]

*  for someone that you don't know, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3117.42s)]

*  you are welcome here. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3129.42s)]

*  everyone is valued. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3133.42s)]
*  But we have [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3135.42s)]
*  to stand together. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3137.42s)]
*  We cannot [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3139.42s)]
*  be tempted [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3141.42s)]
*  to turn in our neighbors [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3143.42s)]
*  or be fooled into thinking that we [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3145.42s)]
*  are really that much different from [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3147.42s)]
*  a trans kid who wants to get accepted [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3149.42s)]
*  by their friends. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3151.42s)]
*  That we're that different [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3153.42s)]
*  from a dreamer who [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3155.42s)]
*  worked to go to college and try [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3157.42s)]
*  to provide for their family. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3159.42s)]
*  That we're that different [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3161.42s)]
*  from anyone who's not [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3163.42s)]
*  like us. Hate [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3165.42s)]
*  is a trap that [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3167.42s)]
*  sinks us all. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3169.42s)]
*  And it is standing [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3171.42s)]
*  together, without exception, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3173.42s)]
*  to reject division. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3175.42s)]
*  That is [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3177.42s)]
*  the only way we [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3179.42s)]
*  can win. It's the only [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3181.42s)]
*  way we can win. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3183.42s)]
*  So, I hope [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3185.42s)]
*  you see that this [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3187.42s)]
*  movement is not about [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3189.42s)]
*  partisan labels or purity tests. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3191.42s)]
*  But it's about class [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3193.42s)]
*  solidarity. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3195.42s)]
*  It is about the thousands [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3199.42s)]
*  of you who came out here today [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3201.42s)]
*  to stand together and [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3203.42s)]
*  say our lives deserve dignity [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3205.42s)]
*  and our work deserves [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3207.42s)]
*  respect. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3209.42s)]
*  No matter who we are, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3211.42s)]
*  we are here [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3213.42s)]
*  to make a sacred [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3215.42s)]
*  promise to each other. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3217.42s)]
*  And our goal today [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3219.42s)]
*  is to commit to building [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3221.42s)]
*  the kind of country we all [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3223.42s)]
*  deserve. And we [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3225.42s)]
*  will make that promise. To [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3227.42s)]
*  take care of each other on our worst [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3229.42s)]
*  days. And to share [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3231.42s)]
*  in the successes of our best. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3233.42s)]
*  Thank you so much, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3235.42s)]

*  here today [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3243.42s)]

*  You are making Donald Trump [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3526.14s)]

*  Okay [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3536.14s)]
*  Your presence here today [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3538.8599999999997s)]
*  And by the way there are some 36,000 of you [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3542.8599999999997s)]
*  The largest rally that we have ever had [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3552.8599999999997s)]
*  And your presence here today is making Donald Trump and Elon Musk very nervous [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3557.58s)]
*  Last time we did a rally in Denver a little bit smaller than this [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3580.58s)]
*  Thank you LA [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3585.2999999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk announced that everybody at the rally, or most of the people, were paid organizers [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3591.2999999999997s)]
*  Anybody here get paid to come today? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3602.2999999999997s)]
*  Me, no [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3606.2999999999997s)]
*  And Donald Trump, very envious of sizes [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3607.2999999999997s)]
*  George Soros, George Soros paid me [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3610.2999999999997s)]
*  He said, well Bernie has rallies of 2 or 3,000 people can't compete with Trump [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3613.02s)]
*  He lied [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3619.02s)]
*  So I invite the President to come to LA [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3623.02s)]
*  Tell the people here why you think it's a great idea [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3629.02s)]
*  To cut Medicaid and nutrition and healthcare [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3633.02s)]
*  To give tax breaks to billionaires, the people of LA would love to hear that [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3637.74s)]
*  So why are we here in LA today? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3646.74s)]
*  And the answer is obvious [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3649.74s)]
*  We are living in a moment of extraordinary danger [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3653.74s)]
*  And how we respond to this moment will not only impact our lives [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3660.4599999999996s)]
*  But will impact the lives of our kids and future generations [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3668.4599999999996s)]
*  And in terms of the climate [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3674.4599999999996s)]
*  It will depend, we can depend on whether or not the planet Earth survives [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3678.4599999999996s)]
*  That's why we're here today [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3684.4599999999996s)]
*  We're living in a moment where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of our country [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3690.4599999999996s)]
*  We're living in a moment with a President who has no understanding or respect for the Constitution of the United States [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3702.4599999999996s)]
*  And let us make no doubt about it [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3713.18s)]
*  Moving us rapidly toward an authoritarian form of society [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3718.18s)]
*  And Mr. Trump, we ain't going there [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3728.18s)]
*  We are living in a moment where the Republican Party has, to a large degree, become a cult of the individual [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3731.8999999999996s)]
*  Obeying Trump's every wish [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3744.8999999999996s)]
*  And at a time of massive income and wealth inequality [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3748.8999999999996s)]
*  Right now, as we speak, they are plotting about how they can give 1.1 trillion in tax breaks [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3753.8999999999996s)]
*  To the 1% and devastate programs their working families need [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3761.62s)]
*  You know, it's funny, just yesterday, a good friend [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3769.62s)]
*  Mr. Musk sent out a tweet [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3780.62s)]
*  And in essence, he said, you know, Bernie Sanders has been talking about the growth of oligarchy [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3782.62s)]
*  Year after year after year [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3789.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, Elon, you're damn right, that's what I've been talking about [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3792.3399999999997s)]
*  The difference is, I'm no longer talking about how we're moving to oligarchy [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3802.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm talking about how we are living today in an oligarchy [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3809.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh, I guess so, I bet [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3814.06s)]
*  Three months ago, when Trump was inaugurated, standing right behind him during his inauguration [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3817.06s)]
*  Were the three wealthiest people in this country, Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos, and Mr. Zuckerberg [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3825.06s)]
*  And right behind them were 13 other billionaires who Trump had nominated to head up major federal agencies [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3832.7799999999997s)]
*  And that, brothers and sisters, is what oligarchy is all about [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3850.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, lately, given what's happening in America [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3857.5s)]
*  I've been remembering the history lessons that I learned when I was in the sixth grade [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3861.5s)]
*  And I remember, and I think many of you will recall, when you think about your education [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3868.5s)]
*  You'll remember hearing about Abraham Lincoln on the fields of Gettysburg in 1863 [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3873.5s)]
*  That was just a few days after 20,000 Union soldiers had either died or been wind wounded [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3883.22s)]
*  Fighting against the nightmare of slavery [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3891.22s)]
*  And Lincoln looked out on that field, and this is what he said, you all remember [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3896.22s)]
*  He said, quote, we hear highly resolved that these dead shall not have died in vain [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3901.22s)]
*  That this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3911.9399999999996s)]
*  And that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3916.9399999999996s)]
*  And that is precisely why we are here today [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3932.9399999999996s)]
*  To make sure that government of, by, and for the people does not perish [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3938.66s)]
*  And that we do not become a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, and for the billionaire class [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3943.66s)]
*  The American people do not want the richest guy on earth running all over Washington, D.C. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3956.66s)]
*  Decimating the Social Security Administration [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3964.3799999999997s)]
*  Making it harder, the richest guy on earth, making it harder for old people with disabilities [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3969.3799999999997s)]
*  To get the benefits that they paid into [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3975.3799999999997s)]
*  Proposing to lay off 83,000 workers at the Veterans Administration [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3981.3799999999997s)]
*  Denying the health care that the men and women who put their lives on line to defend us deserve [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3989.1s)]
*  Slashing the Department of Education [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=3999.1s)]
*  Decimating USAID [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4004.1s)]
*  Which by the way means that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of the most desperate people in this world will die as a result [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4008.1s)]
*  And when we talk about oligarchy, it is not just economics [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4019.1s)]
*  I trust that all of you know that you are living under a corrupt campaign finance system [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4027.1s)]
*  Which allows billionaires to buy elections [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4034.1s)]
*  Don't tell me about democracy when Musk himself can put $270 million to elect Donald Trump [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4037.8199999999997s)]
*  And then get rewarded with the most important position in government [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4048.8199999999997s)]
*  But it's not just Musk and Republicans, it's the Democratic Party as well [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4058.8199999999997s)]
*  Their billionaires tell candidates don't stand up to the powerful special interests [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4064.54s)]
*  And too many Democrats are listening to them [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4072.54s)]
*  And that is why, that is why if we want to preserve democracy in America [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4076.54s)]
*  We've got to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4082.54s)]
*  And we've got to move to public funding of elections [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4089.2599999999998s)]
*  In America, one person, one vote, not billionaires buying elections [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4099.26s)]
*  Let me tell you something about the oligarchs [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4109.26s)]
*  They are very, very religious people [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4113.9800000000005s)]
*  But their religion is not based on doing unto others as you would have them do unto you [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4120.9800000000005s)]
*  Their religion is not based on love or justice [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4128.9800000000005s)]
*  Their religion is based on greed, greed and maury [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4134.9800000000005s)]
*  All over this country, in Vermont, California, all over this country [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4143.9800000000005s)]
*  We have a serious problem with drug addiction, with alcoholism, with other forms of addiction [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4148.9800000000005s)]
*  But in my honest opinion, the most serious addiction crisis we face is the addiction of the oligarchy toward greed [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4156.9800000000005s)]
*  They've got billions and billions of dollars, it's not enough, they need more [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4167.7s)]
*  And if they have to step on the poor and the disabled and working class people [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4175.7s)]
*  That is what they will do, unless we stop them and we will stop them [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4181.7s)]
*  But it's not just oligarchy we are fighting [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4197.7s)]
*  We're fighting [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4200.7s)]
*  EMC [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4204.7s)]
*  Raise your hand where the problem is [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4211.7s)]
*  Okay, we got somebody there? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4213.7s)]
*  Got it, somebody? Okay, thank you [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4216.7s)]
*  Applause [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4220.42s)]
*  But it's not just oligarchy, we are fighting [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4226.42s)]
*  We're fighting a president who undermines our constitution every day [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4230.42s)]
*  And threatens our freedom of speech and assembly [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4235.42s)]
*  And whose agents are rounding up innocent people off the streets [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4238.42s)]
*  Putting them in unmarked vans and throwing them in detention centers [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4244.42s)]
*  That is what happens in dictatorships, not democracies [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4250.42s)]
*  And we're going to stop that outrageous action on the part of the president [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4258.42s)]
*  You know, our founding fathers in this country were no dummies [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4266.42s)]
*  They wrote a constitution and established a form of government with a separation of powers [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4272.14s)]
*  Remember our reading all about that? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4280.14s)]
*  You got a legislative body, Congress, you got an executive branch, president, you got a judiciary, the federal council [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4283.14s)]
*  And they wrote that document because they had just fought a brutal war against the autocratic king of England [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4292.14s)]
*  And what they understood as they were forming this new country [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4299.860000000001s)]
*  That they never wanted to see a nation where one person had unlimited power [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4303.860000000001s)]
*  Well, Trump wants that power, we are not giving it to him [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4312.860000000001s)]
*  Trump is suing the media because they say bad things about him [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4318.58s)]
*  Oh, how horrible is that? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4330.58s)]
*  He has sued ABC, CBS, better than Des Moines Register [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4333.58s)]
*  His FCC is investigating NPR and PBS [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4337.58s)]
*  He loves the media when they fawn over him, but he can't take criticism [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4343.3s)]
*  This from a guy who has made vulgar comments about his opponents [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4351.3s)]
*  Hey Mr. President, if you can't take criticism, get out of politics [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4357.3s)]
*  That's what democracy means [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4362.3s)]
*  He is the power of Congress [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4366.02s)]
*  He is illegally abolishing agencies that Congress created [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4369.02s)]
*  He is withholding funding that Congress has appropriated [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4377.02s)]
*  He is establishing tariffs that he has no legal right to do [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4381.02s)]
*  But it's not just the media and Congress [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4389.02s)]
*  That he is trying to intimidate [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4392.740000000001s)]
*  In an absolutely outrageous and unconstitutional way [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4395.740000000001s)]
*  He is going after the judiciary [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4399.740000000001s)]
*  His view is if a decision comes down from a judge that you don't like [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4402.740000000001s)]
*  You try to get rid of that judge and impeach him or her [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4411.740000000001s)]
*  He is going after law firms that have opposed him and his interests in the past [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4416.46s)]
*  And disgracefully, a number of these law firms have caved in [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4423.46s)]
*  He is going after universities [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4431.46s)]
*  And the function of a university is to protect its students [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4438.46s)]
*  The function of a university, a school of higher education, is to pursue the truth [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4444.18s)]
*  Not to cave in to an authoritarian president to protect the federal grants they get [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4451.18s)]
*  But it is not just Trump's and his administration's domestic policy [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4463.18s)]
*  That we should be concerned about [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4468.18s)]
*  For the first time in our 250 year history [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4471.900000000001s)]
*  We have a president who is aligning himself with dictatorship abroad [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4474.900000000001s)]
*  No, Mr. Trump, Ukraine did not start that war, Putin and Russia did [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4486.900000000001s)]
*  We must leave the world in supporting democracies, not supporting Putin and dictatorship [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4494.62s)]
*  So let me tell you something else [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4505.62s)]
*  Trump wants over 8 billion more dollars to go to Netanyahu's war machine [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4508.62s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorism [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4517.34s)]
*  But it does not have a right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4526.34s)]
*  It does not have the right to kill 50,000 people, injure over 100,000 and destroy the entire infrastructure [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4534.06s)]
*  And as bad as that is, as bad as that is, Trump wants to expel the 2.2 million people in Gaza [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4549.06s)]
*  In order to create a playground for his billionaire friends [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4562.780000000001s)]
*  That is beyond insane and we will never, never let that happen [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4571.780000000001s)]
*  Brothers and sisters, not just oligarchy and authoritarianism [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4578.5s)]
*  Our job right now, at a time when the very richest people in America are becoming phenomenally richer [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4587.5s)]
*  Our job is to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4597.5s)]
*  Are you going to do something radical here? Are you ready? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4608.5s)]
*  I'm going to tell the truth [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4613.5s)]
*  We're going to talk about what's really going on in America today [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4619.5s)]
*  And that is we are living with two Americas [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4622.5s)]
*  One America, the people on top, have never ever in the history of our country had it so good [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4625.5s)]
*  Today we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4635.22s)]
*  The three wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of American society [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4640.22s)]
*  170 million people [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4647.22s)]
*  The top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90% [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4654.22s)]
*  And the CEOs of major corporations now earn 300 times what their workers are making [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4660.9400000000005s)]
*  Is there a medical issue? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4668.9400000000005s)]
*  Alright, we need an EMC there, raise your hand guys [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4670.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I was, I couldn't find food for us, unfortunately [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4680.9400000000005s)]
*  I was scavenged [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4685.9400000000005s)]
*  But it's not just income and wealth inequality [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4688.66s)]
*  We have more concentration of ownership today than we have ever had [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4693.66s)]
*  We have a handful of corporations owning sector and sector of our economy [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4699.66s)]
*  So that is one America, people on top doing phenomenally well [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4706.66s)]
*  Let me tell you about the other America that you know very, very well [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4711.66s)]
*  And that is that 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4716.38s)]
*  Anybody here living paycheck to paycheck? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4721.38s)]
*  I grew up like Donald Trump, I grew up in a family [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4724.38s)]
*  Why is March raising his hand? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4728.38s)]
*  That lived paycheck to paycheck, so I know a little bit about that [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4729.38s)]
*  And the result of living paycheck to paycheck [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4734.38s)]
*  Check, March is raising his hand right now [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4737.38s)]
*  That working class people in America die seven years earlier than the rich [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4741.1s)]
*  Alright, I'm going to ask you a question, why is that? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4752.1s)]
*  Alright, you got it [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4755.1s)]
*  The answer is stress [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4757.1s)]
*  If you've got to worry every single day how you're going to feed your kids [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4759.1s)]
*  How you're going to pay the rent [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4763.1s)]
*  How you're going to make sure that your car doesn't break down so you can get to work [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4766.820000000001s)]
*  How you're going to afford to provide for your kid when your kid gets sick and needs to go to a doctor [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4771.820000000001s)]
*  How you have to work when your schedule is changed every day and your boss doesn't care about you [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4778.820000000001s)]
*  When you live under those conditions day after day, year after year [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4784.820000000001s)]
*  It eats away at your body, it eats away in your mind [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4791.54s)]
*  We need to create an economy where all of our people can live out their life expectancy in the way that they should [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4797.54s)]
*  You know why people all over this country are angry and in fact some of them end up voting for Trump? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4809.26s)]
*  Let me tell you something you don't hear much about in the corporate media or the halls of Congress [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4824.26s)]
*  Today, if you can believe it, despite a huge increase in worker productivity [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4829.26s)]
*  Real inflation accounted for wages are lower today than they were 52 years ago [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4836.9800000000005s)]
*  So workers are producing more and more but all of the benefits are going to the top 1% [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4849.9800000000005s)]
*  During that same period we have seen a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1% [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4857.7s)]
*  Today in America half of all the workers have nothing in the bank as they face retirement [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4875.7s)]
*  22% of our seniors are living on $15,000 a year or less [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4883.42s)]
*  And 800,000 Americans are sleeping out on the streets [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4890.42s)]
*  Today as I look at this great crowd I remember another rally that I attended [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4899.42s)]
*  I wasn't up here, I was way, way back [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4905.42s)]
*  And that was in 1963 [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4909.14s)]
*  I was in Washington for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s great I Have a Drink speech [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4912.14s)]
*  And the truth is while many, many problems remain [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4922.14s)]
*  We should be proud that we have made significant progress in fighting racism [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4926.14s)]
*  And I can remember several decades ago that in the United States Senate there were all of two women [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4933.860000000001s)]
*  Virtually no women governors, very few women in the House [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4940.860000000001s)]
*  Hundreds of women died every year because they could not access legal abortions [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4945.860000000001s)]
*  I can remember growing up when young people who were gay were ashamed to acknowledge that and suffered in their silence [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4955.58s)]
*  And nobody back then would have dreamed that we would achieve gay marriage in many states in this country [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4972.58s)]
*  So my point is that we have made and should be proud of the fact that we have made progress in a number of enormously important areas [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4980.3s)]
*  But we should also be conscious that in perhaps the most important issue, the economic struggle that so many Americans are now engaged in [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=4993.3s)]
*  We have lost ground [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5007.02s)]
*  Back in 1944, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the great presidents in the history of our country [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5011.02s)]
*  He gave a State of the Union address [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5023.02s)]
*  And this is what he said back in 1944 [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5026.02s)]
*  He said, you know what, we are a great country, we have a great constitution, we have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5029.02s)]
*  But what we need to add to that is to understand that economic rights are human rights [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5036.740000000001s)]
*  That if you can't afford to go to a doctor, doesn't really matter about voting [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5049.740000000001s)]
*  If you can't afford to feed your kids, freedom of assembly doesn't matter that much [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5056.740000000001s)]
*  So today, in the year 2025, we have got to pick up that banner [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5063.46s)]
*  Economic rights are human rights, every single person is a part of it [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5072.46s)]
*  This gets to a very fundamental issue [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5079.18s)]
*  Musk and his friends see you as nothing more than workers to be disposed of [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5082.18s)]
*  They got rid of tens of thousands of federal workers [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5087.18s)]
*  And when information, artificial information and robotics comes, they're going to throw you out on the street as well [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5090.18s)]
*  They don't give a damn about you [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5097.18s)]
*  They don't give a damn about your kids [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5100.900000000001s)]
*  And what we are going to do is say, sorry, we are human beings [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5103.900000000001s)]
*  And we are entitled to certain fundamental economic rights [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5111.900000000001s)]
*  So no, we are not going to give you a damn [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5118.900000000001s)]
*  We are going to give you a damn [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5121.900000000001s)]
*  We are entitled to certain fundamental economic rights [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5124.62s)]
*  So no, we are not going to give more tax breaks to billionaires [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5128.62s)]
*  We are going to demand that they start paying their fair share of taxes [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5134.62s)]
*  No, we are not going to keep a federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5144.62s)]
*  We are going to raise that wage to a living wage [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5151.34s)]
*  No worker in America should live in poverty [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5154.34s)]
*  End of discussion [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5158.34s)]
*  We are going to pass the PRO Act to make sure that employers cannot act illegally when workers are trying to form unions [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5165.34s)]
*  We are going to grow the trade union movement [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5175.34s)]
*  In America, we are not going to turn our backs on our parents and grandparents who helped build this country [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5181.34s)]
*  We are not going to cut Social Security [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5189.34s)]
*  We are going to expand Social Security benefits [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5192.34s)]
*  And by the way, we are going to reestablish the fine benefit pensions for workers in this America [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5198.34s)]
*  Instead of making massive cuts to Medicaid, we must do what every other major country on earth does [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5207.06s)]
*  It ain't radical [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5218.06s)]
*  Healthcare is a human right [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5220.06s)]
*  We are going to guarantee healthcare to all [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5222.06s)]
*  Through a Medicare for all single payer system [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5228.06s)]
*  The function of healthcare is not to make the insurance companies and the drug companies rich [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5232.780000000001s)]
*  And we are going to stop paying ten times more for some prescription drugs than the people of other countries [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5241.780000000001s)]
*  We can lower prescription drugs by 50% [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5249.780000000001s)]
*  Here in LA, in Burlington, Vermont and all across this country, we have a major housing crisis [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5253.5s)]
*  Am I right? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5264.5s)]
*  And it's not just homelessness [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5266.5s)]
*  It's people paying 40, 50, 60% of their limited incomes in housing [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5269.5s)]
*  Instead of spending a trillion dollars a year on the military, let's build 5 million units of low income and affordable housing [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5276.22s)]
*  Brothers and sisters, we live in a competitive global economy [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5292.22s)]
*  And if we are going to effectively compete, we need the best educated workforce in the world [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5296.22s)]
*  It is nothing less than insane and counterproductive that we have young people leaving higher education 50, 80,000 dollars in debt [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5306.22s)]
*  We need more doctors [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5319.22s)]
*  You know what doctors are leaving medical school with? 500,000 dollars in debt [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5321.22s)]
*  Nurses are leaving 100,000 dollars in debt [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5326.22s)]
*  Education is a human right from childcare through college [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5329.9400000000005s)]
*  We need chief metal workers, we need conferences, we need construction workers, we need apprenticeship programs [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5338.9400000000005s)]
*  We need to make public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition free [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5350.66s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks that climate change is a quote unquote hoax originating in China [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5365.66s)]
*  This state, California, has gone through enough pain to know that climate change is not a hoax [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5374.38s)]
*  It is an existential threat to this state, to Vermont, to the whole country and the whole world [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5383.38s)]
*  Instead of appeasing the fossil fuel industry, who are lying and destroying our planet [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5393.38s)]
*  We are going to transform our energy system and lead the world into sustainable energy and energy efficiency [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5400.1s)]
*  And we create millions of good paying jobs as we do that [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5410.1s)]
*  Look, I don't have to tell anyone here that this is a moment in the modern history of our country [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5415.1s)]
*  We've never gone through anything like this [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5424.820000000001s)]
*  But this is what I do want to say [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5427.820000000001s)]
*  Despair is not an option [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5429.820000000001s)]
*  Giving up and hiding under the covers is not acceptable [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5433.820000000001s)]
*  The stakes are just too high [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5442.820000000001s)]
*  Now let me tell you, when Donald Trump looks out at this crowd and they pay attention to this stuff [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5447.54s)]
*  and Elon Musk does [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5453.54s)]
*  You are scaring the hell out of them [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5455.54s)]
*  Because they know what you know and what I know [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5463.54s)]
*  Is that they are the 1%, we are the 99% [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5469.54s)]
*  Back in 1857, when abolitionists were working day and night to end the nightmare of slavery [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5477.54s)]
*  This is what Frederick Douglass, you all remember Frederick Douglass? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5492.54s)]
*  Very great abolitionist [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5497.54s)]
*  Listen closely to what he said because it is as relevant today as it was back then in the fight against slavery [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5500.26s)]
*  This is what he said [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5509.26s)]
*  Power conceives nothing without a demand [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5511.26s)]
*  It never did and it never will [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5516.26s)]
*  Find out just when any people will quietly submit to [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5521.26s)]
*  And you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5527.9800000000005s)]
*  And these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5536.9800000000005s)]
*  The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5543.9800000000005s)]
*  The oligarchy will concede nothing [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5557.9800000000005s)]
*  They have the wealth, they have the power, they own Congress, they own the White House, they own much of the media [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5563.9800000000005s)]
*  But they don't own us [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5574.9800000000005s)]
*  Now I'm not going to tell you that it's going to be easy, it's not [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5579.7s)]
*  We're going to have to fight them door to door, workplace to workplace, school to school [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5588.7s)]
*  We're going to have to educate, we're going to have to mobilize, we're going to have to stand up in a dozen different ways [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5595.7s)]
*  But from the bottom of my heart and I've been to every state of this country [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5601.7s)]
*  I don't care whether you're Republican, Democrat or Independent [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5607.42s)]
*  The people of this country do not want oligarchy, they do not want authoritarianism [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5610.42s)]
*  And they want a government that works for all of us, not just the 1% [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5616.42s)]
*  Thank you all very much [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5623.42s)]
*  Alright we gotta go guys, we gotta go [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPz-7xPWk4&t=5630.42s)]
