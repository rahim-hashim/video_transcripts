# Hasan Inspires Political Action At The University Of Chicago
**HasanAbi:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc)
*  And the media is absolutely going to go along with it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=0.0s)]
*  And lo and behold, that's precisely what happened. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3.24s)]
*  Three years after that, you had Biden on October 6th [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=5.08s)]
*  coming out and saying that they were unveiling [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=9.36s)]
*  this incredibly draconian, incredibly right-wing, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  white nativist anti-immigrant agenda package [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=17.44s)]
*  that they said, that a Oklahoma senator wrote. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=20.04s)]
*  And it was basically Trump's 2020 immigration agenda [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=24.68s)]
*  repackaged. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=29.56s)]
*  Originally from Istanbul, Piper began his career [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=36.56s)]
*  after college at the Yom Kipps. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=39.56s)]
*  He created the segment, The Breakdown from the TYT Network. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=41.519999999999996s)]

*  across YouTube and Twitter. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  He rose to prominence during the pandemic [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=51.72s)]
*  and gained further attention for his coverage [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=53.56s)]
*  of the 2024 election cycle. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=56.04s)]
*  All within an ever-evolving media environment. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Look at, they look so excited. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=61.72s)]

*  and a member of the Institute of Politics for. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=70.16s)]
*  Some quick housekeeping before we begin. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=73.0s)]
*  First, please remember to silence your phones. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=75.12s)]

*  So please line up for that and remember that priority [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=82.24s)]
*  for the first questions will go to students. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=85.16s)]

*  and celebrate one of the city's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  most iconic musical traditions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  You can register for both of those events [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=114.52s)]
*  on the IOP's website. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=116.08s)]
*  Now, please join me welcoming to the stage [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=117.96s)]
*  Hassan Piker and his dad, Hector. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=120.6s)]
*  Wow. What do you think of that music? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=122.52s)]
*  That was, that's the perfect intro music. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  As soon as there was an Ethan Klein mention, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=153.12s)]
*  I was like, oh, I'm surrounded by fans. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=154.64s)]
*  This is... [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=156.48s)]
*  Yo, I'm so excited to be here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=158.32s)]
*  My name is Sted Herndon, as they mentioned, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=160.6s)]
*  I'm a politics reporter at the New York Times, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=162.12s)]
*  and I am on the board of advisors [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=164.12s)]
*  of the Institute of Politics. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=165.76s)]
*  And I'm super excited for us to be here with Hassan Piker, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=167.2s)]
*  and to lead this conversation today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=170.12s)]
*  I know they went over some of this stuff before, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=172.28s)]
*  but I will reemphasize a couple things. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=174.12s)]
*  You know, this, like a lot of IOP events, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=177.04s)]
*  is meant to stoke political discourse, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=178.68s)]
*  to engage in discussion, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=181.12s)]
*  and even a little good hearted debate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=182.28s)]
*  And I think that we're gonna see some of that today, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=185.0s)]
*  but it's also to engage with students. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=187.12s)]
*  So there will be student questions at the end. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=188.52s)]
*  And when you see the microphones come out, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=190.96s)]
*  you do not have to wait. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=192.68s)]
*  You can start lining up at that time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=193.56s)]
*  But I'm going to jump in here, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=196.96s)]
*  and I think my questions are really gonna go [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=198.4s)]
*  in a little bit of an arc to learn more [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=200.36s)]
*  about kind of where, how you found yourself here, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=202.24s)]
*  and then get to some political stuff more towards the end. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=204.12s)]
*  I think we broadly know your path, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  going from the Young Turks, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=208.36s)]
*  to one of the biggest Twitch streamers in the country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  But what is the origin of your interest in politics, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=212.72000000000003s)]
*  and what was the moment where you decided [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  to break off of the Young Turks, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=216.36s)]
*  and go off on yourself? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=217.8s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=220.12s)]
*  So I was always interested in politics, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  because I grew up in Turkey. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=224.68s)]
*  And it's, you're, you kind of get thrown [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=226.36s)]
*  into the realm of politics in Turkey, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  because it's way more impactful, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  way more consequential than the way [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=235.84s)]
*  that a lot of Americans view it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=237.28s)]
*  And I grew up in the Erdogan regime taking power as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=239.08s)]
*  And I saw a lot of that social conservatism, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=245.0s)]
*  and the immediate ways that it changed my life. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=247.56s)]
*  I was a big fan of political cartoons. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=251.84s)]
*  And I remember these political cartoonists [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  that I used to read were getting sued [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=259.52s)]
*  by the Erdogan administration, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=262.2s)]
*  which is not so dissimilar when you think [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=264.64s)]
*  about what Donald Trump is doing right now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=266.6s)]
*  And there's definitely a direct analog there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=268.56s)]
*  But it was little things like that, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=271.88s)]
*  and life changing in meaningful ways [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=274.24s)]
*  that always kept me interested in talking about politics, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=276.48s)]
*  and keeping up with the discourse from an early age. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=280.68s)]
*  And then as far as like how I transitioned [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=284.92s)]
*  from the Young Turks to go out on my own, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=287.8s)]
*  in 2019, I had a unique moment, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  let's say on stream, I had a heated gaming moment, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=297.44s)]
*  where I said America deserved 9-11. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  And the thing is, when you're a leftist commentator, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=301.4s)]
*  when you're in politics and the leftist space, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  you always get doxxed, swatted. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  It's something that has been a part of the job, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  unfortunately. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=316.44s)]
*  But this time it was different, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=317.88s)]
*  because it was on Fox News, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=319.24s)]
*  and Dan Crenshaw was crying on Laura Ingraham. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  And all of a sudden, that became way more prominent. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=324.08s)]
*  And they started yelling at other random people [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=329.08s)]
*  that worked at the Young Turks as well. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  The key grip was getting doxxed. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  And I was like, this dude is not, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=335.84s)]
*  this is my dumb ass, don't doxx the key grip. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=337.88s)]
*  And I didn't want that kind of unwarranted attention [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=343.12s)]
*  to go towards other people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  for things that I was saying and doing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=349.28s)]
*  So that was my first foray into wanting to go, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=351.6s)]
*  wanting to go out on my own. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  And yeah, I went full-time in 2020, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=358.44s)]
*  and I started live streaming every day. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=361.76000000000005s)]
*  And by the end of 2020, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=364.12s)]
*  I had become a fairly sizable content creator [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  on the platform, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=369.04s)]
*  one of the biggest content creators on Twitch. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=369.88s)]
*  And I'll say, since then, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  I've also invited a lot more negative attention to myself, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=376.24s)]
*  but at least it's just me this time. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  We hear a lot about how these new internet spaces [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  are apolitical. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=383.8s)]
*  A lot of your colleagues in the Twitch space [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=384.64s)]
*  stay away from politics. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=386.64s)]
*  I'm wondering what made you, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=388.36s)]
*  I mean, I know it's kind of natural to your interest. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=390.56s)]
*  Why do you think talking about politics works for you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=392.6s)]
*  on the platform? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=394.6s)]
*  What are the ways that you have learned [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=395.48s)]
*  to crack that space if others haven't? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=397.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, at first I wanted people [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=401.12s)]
*  to talk about politics, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=405.12s)]
*  because I thought there were a lot [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=406.08s)]
*  of progressive people out there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=407.24s)]
*  I thought it was good to show [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=409.68s)]
*  that progressive politics is not shameful, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=411.68s)]
*  that people shouldn't be afraid [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=414.36s)]
*  of speaking their opinions on these matters. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=416.4s)]
*  And then Asmongold became the largest [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=419.96s)]
*  political content creator on the platform, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=421.68s)]
*  and some people know who that is, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=423.56s)]
*  but he's a right-wing commentator now, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=425.48s)]
*  the biggest right-wing commentator in North America, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=429.0s)]
*  actually, and now I'm like, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=431.32s)]
*  maybe don't talk about politics. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=432.44s)]
*  It's better if they stay apolitical. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=434.6s)]
*  But for the most part, I think apolitical, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  the apolitical nature of this space [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=440.84s)]
*  is just a way to shelter [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=443.32s)]
*  your more reactionary tendencies in general. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=446.08s)]
*  I think people say that they're apolitical, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=448.88s)]
*  or they say that they're operating [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=451.44s)]
*  off of common sense beliefs, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=453.23999999999995s)]
*  but usually that just simply means you're right-wing [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=454.88s)]
*  and not open about it, at least in my experience. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=458.28s)]
*  Yeah, but obviously, this has been a bigger discussion, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=462.12s)]
*  since Democrats have not been in that space, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=467.24s)]
*  and there's been some thought about [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=468.88s)]
*  how do they find themselves more naturally there. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=469.96s)]
*  But I'll talk about that later, actually. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  I wanna ask more directly, do you consider the line [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=475.44s)]
*  between entertainment and activism? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=478.0s)]
*  Do you think of yourself as a journalist? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=479.92s)]
*  How do you actually see your role? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=482.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  I see myself as a political commentator. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=485.76s)]
*  Depending on who I'm talking to, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=488.2s)]
*  I'll explain it as Rush Limbaugh without the brain rot, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=489.2s)]
*  literally and figuratively, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=492.8s)]
*  because he had brain cancer. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=494.16s)]
*  And also- [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=495.96s)]
*  You also said you don't have brain rot, I'm impressed. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=496.8s)]
*  Yeah, and also, brain cancer and also, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=499.36s)]
*  I think, holes in his brain from prescription drug overuse. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=501.52s)]
*  He's dead, he can't, what's he gonna do? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=507.24s)]
*  We're focused on that now, though. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=509.72s)]
*  Anyway, but it's basically like AM radio, but for Zoomers. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=511.04s)]
*  So that's the way I describe it to people. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=516.24s)]
*  And I do find myself to be more of an entertainer [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=518.32s)]
*  than an activist, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=521.16s)]
*  even though I do engage in activism, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=522.6s)]
*  I always stress that I'm simply an entertainer [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=524.48s)]
*  and I'm trying to urge others to go out [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=527.2s)]
*  and organize as well, because I'm just one person [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=528.88s)]
*  and I would be saying these things [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=532.24s)]
*  even if I had 30 people watching me. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=533.96s)]
*  But when I have 30,000, 40,000 people watching me, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=536.0400000000001s)]
*  that means there are 30,000 to 40,000 people [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=539.4s)]
*  that can go out and organize [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=542.08s)]
*  and then build a movement that way. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  So yeah, I see myself as a political commentator [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=546.16s)]
*  and not an activist, even though I do engage in that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=549.98s)]
*  One of the things I think that folks have found, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=553.7s)]
*  obviously your audience testament to this room, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=556.5s)]
*  excuse Younger, excuse folks who are highly online. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=558.62s)]
*  I'm wondering, I mean, is that false? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=561.9s)]
*  But I guess I'm saying, I think it's also capturing [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=566.38s)]
*  an audience that legacy media has missed, right? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=568.58s)]
*  What do you think is working in terms of why people [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=570.98s)]
*  are coming to folks like you, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=572.94s)]
*  versus why places like even the New York Times [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=574.26s)]
*  are struggling to reach some of those people? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=576.62s)]
*  I think there is a personality aspect to it for sure, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=579.7s)]
*  but I think the medium that I'm in is so interactive [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=584.42s)]
*  and people are looking for that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=589.18s)]
*  There's a sense of community building that exists online [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=590.86s)]
*  on Twitch and in live streaming in general. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=594.78s)]
*  And that is not exactly replicable [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=597.26s)]
*  by traditional media outlets. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=600.66s)]
*  And they're never gonna be able to do that regardless. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=602.58s)]
*  It'd be really funny if Jake Tapper was trying to, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=605.62s)]
*  if Jake Tapper had like parasocial stands, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=608.54s)]
*  that'd be weird. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=611.0999999999999s)]
*  Doubtful. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=614.5s)]
*  But I think that's definitely one reason [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=616.18s)]
*  for why I have these audiences. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=621.02s)]
*  I'm also at a place, like I speak the language. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=623.54s)]
*  I'm from a different generation. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=626.18s)]
*  And I'm also not in the same traditional media orbit. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=629.0999999999999s)]
*  So I wasn't put through the ringer [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=632.86s)]
*  to develop a certain way of speaking [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=636.06s)]
*  and develop an attitude that is like [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=639.5s)]
*  very DC media bubble oriented. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=641.8599999999999s)]
*  And I think that that is genuine and people appreciate that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  To the point about the community, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=649.5799999999999s)]
*  I found it really fascinating. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=650.8599999999999s)]
*  Like it's very obvious, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=652.3s)]
*  kind of the power that like folks like you hold. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  I could say I could add up every CNN hit I did [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=656.54s)]
*  of all last year. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=659.0999999999999s)]
*  They did not derive enough interest or followers [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=659.9799999999999s)]
*  or conversation as doing one of those strings. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=662.6199999999999s)]
*  But I also wonder if that creates a kind of feedback loop. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=665.34s)]
*  Like when I'm doing a story, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=668.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't have to really think about audience [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=669.22s)]
*  or immediate kind of reaction. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=671.5400000000001s)]
*  Do you feel kind of a pressure [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=673.6600000000001s)]
*  because you're in a kind of continuous relationship [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=674.86s)]
*  with audience? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=677.9s)]
*  I mean, do you worry about saying some stuff [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=678.74s)]
*  because the chat won't like it? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=680.1800000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=681.7800000000001s)]
*  I yell at them all the time. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=683.58s)]
*  Trust me, there's gonna be do's on the microphone today [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=685.7800000000001s)]
*  that I'm gonna be yelling at, most likely. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=687.74s)]
*  It's normal. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=689.98s)]
*  It's a normal part of the process. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=690.82s)]
*  Like some people, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=692.38s)]
*  I think there are certainly people [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=694.42s)]
*  that are audience captured in that regard, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=696.3399999999999s)]
*  but like for me, I care. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=698.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm way too stubborn and way too brutally honest [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=700.3s)]
*  and maybe a little autistic. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=704.5s)]
*  So it's just like, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=706.06s)]
*  I don't care if someone is disagreeing with me. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=707.66s)]
*  Like I will take a position that I believe to be true. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=710.9799999999999s)]
*  And obviously I'll arrive at that position [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=715.18s)]
*  by analyzing the facts. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=718.26s)]
*  And even if it's unpopular, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=720.54s)]
*  my goal always is to educate people. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=722.68s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=725.12s)]
*  Like I wouldn't necessarily say that my perspective [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=726.1999999999999s)]
*  that is fairly closer to a more orthodox Marxist perspective [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=731.8s)]
*  is all too common in American media. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=738.8399999999999s)]
*  Most people have never encountered someone [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=742.88s)]
*  who is speaking about these things [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  from the angle that I take. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=746.5799999999999s)]
*  So I already assume that everyone that's listening in, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=748.72s)]
*  that's tuning in for the first time [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=753.0s)]
*  is not immediately on board [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=754.86s)]
*  with the way that I see the world. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=756.96s)]
*  So I have no expectation with me. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=758.6s)]
*  It's my job to make a convincing argument [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  and to also instill some sense of class consciousness [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=763.12s)]
*  in people that are tuning in. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=768.34s)]
*  You know, I wanna stick on this question [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=770.48s)]
*  of kind of like community [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=772.52s)]
*  and how you kind of moderate that community. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=773.9200000000001s)]
*  You mentioned to me when we were talking another time [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=776.0s)]
*  just about the efforts you all go through [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=777.64s)]
*  in terms of chat moderation. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=779.12s)]
*  I found it really interesting [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=780.68s)]
*  because those type of spaces has been home [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=781.76s)]
*  for bigotry, slurs, things like that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=784.52s)]
*  How much time do you have to spend [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=786.68s)]
*  curating that community and moderating? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=788.6s)]
*  I mean, it's an ongoing process. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=791.64s)]
*  It's always, it's something that I always have to work on [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  because I have, a lot of other places [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  will safeguard their community. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=800.98s)]
*  They'll have like a paywall, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=802.3199999999999s)]
*  like membership only access if you wanna communicate. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=804.28s)]
*  Some places will add like additional checks. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=808.04s)]
*  For me, I wanna have a discourse. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=811.72s)]
*  I wanna have back and forth with people. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=814.0799999999999s)]
*  I wanna be able to educate people [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=815.68s)]
*  if they have questions on certain things. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=818.48s)]
*  So I have a 10 minute follower mode, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=820.52s)]
*  which means if you follow me for 10 minutes on my Twitch, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=823.6999999999999s)]
*  you can say anything you want in the chat. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=827.36s)]
*  And surely some people abuse that. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=829.4s)]
*  They'll come in and they'll try to antagonize [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=832.48s)]
*  or say heinous things. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=836.12s)]
*  But in that process, like I use that as an educational [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=838.44s)]
*  moment and I also use every opportunity like that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=842.72s)]
*  to basically say like these are the well defined boundaries [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=845.64s)]
*  in this community, like what is permissible and what is not. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=848.52s)]
*  And that's one way that we moderate the community. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=851.48s)]
*  To the point about the kind of audience capture, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=856.8s)]
*  particularly around young people, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=859.0s)]
*  so much of the discussion has been around [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=860.28s)]
*  young people's disillusion with the political process. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=861.72s)]
*  I think you speak directly to that. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  I wanted to see, do you consider yourself [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=866.52s)]
*  trying to overcome that disillusion [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=868.24s)]
*  or are you just kind of relating to it [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=869.96s)]
*  and kind of wallowing it? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=872.18s)]
*  Or do you see that kind of education piece [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=873.02s)]
*  as you're trying to move people out of their disillusion? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=874.84s)]
*  Oh for sure. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=877.6s)]
*  I think that disillusionment is a huge problem [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  because everyone has a tendency to fall [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=880.42s)]
*  to the whims of nihilism. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=883.68s)]
*  And I feel like that's really bad [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=885.68s)]
*  for political progress in general. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=887.26s)]
*  It's really bad for political mobilization in general. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=888.92s)]
*  And so one of the things that I try to instill [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=891.68s)]
*  in everyone in my audience is like one, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=895.62s)]
*  self development for sure, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=897.58s)]
*  to create some confidence in yourself, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=899.02s)]
*  achieve short term victories for yourself [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=903.42s)]
*  so you feel more confident [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=905.86s)]
*  and have a little bit of control over things [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=908.18s)]
*  that are in your life that you have control over. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=910.32s)]
*  But overall I think I try to push everyone [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=914.1s)]
*  towards political activism for that reason, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  organizing, community organizing, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=920.36s)]
*  or labor organizing with unions [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=921.86s)]
*  because it's one way that I think people [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  can immediately impact their material conditions [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=927.8s)]
*  in a way that's meaningful. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=932.8399999999999s)]
*  And that I think inspires them [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=934.0s)]
*  to keep pushing for more and more [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=936.28s)]
*  and hopefully build a larger network [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=939.02s)]
*  that can resist against certain things [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=941.48s)]
*  that this administration is doing. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=943.52s)]
*  You know you become a voice for Democrats [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=945.48s)]
*  really asking the why they lost question since the election. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=947.0799999999999s)]
*  I just wanted to start by posing that to you [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=950.56s)]
*  as we start talking about change in parties. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=952.26s)]
*  Why do you think Kamala Harris lost? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=954.4s)]
*  Where do I begin? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=957.6s)]
*  I mean this is, I've talked about this so much [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  at this point. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=962.56s)]
*  Yeah, you can imagine. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=963.4s)]
*  I mean they're, Democrats are zealous. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=964.8s)]
*  Like they are so, they're so married to the idea [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=967.64s)]
*  of maintaining institutional control, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=972.48s)]
*  maintaining the infallibility of institutions [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=976.0s)]
*  and third way neoliberalism [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=978.4399999999999s)]
*  where they think that a little bit of market regulation [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=980.36s)]
*  maybe with a lot more deregulation down the line [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=984.52s)]
*  is how we're going to magically improve [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=987.1600000000001s)]
*  people's material conditions at a time [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=990.44s)]
*  when we have incredible wealth disparity [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=992.02s)]
*  and 600,000 people sleeping outside every night [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=995.5600000000001s)]
*  in the richest country on the planet, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=999.4000000000001s)]
*  in the richest country throughout history. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1000.84s)]
*  And I feel like people see these inequalities [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1003.96s)]
*  and while mainstream media and many other resources [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1007.22s)]
*  that people rely on are constantly telling them, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1011.2800000000001s)]
*  no, no, no, this is normal. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1012.84s)]
*  Like everything that you see is actually normal. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1014.2s)]
*  Like I think there is a great sense of discontent [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1015.88s)]
*  and an anger and if left unchanneled, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1019.64s)]
*  you have right wing reactionary movements [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1022.88s)]
*  that can take that anger, recognize it [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1025.72s)]
*  and then move it to an unproductive, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1028.72s)]
*  move it to an unproductive place [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1031.6000000000001s)]
*  that benefits their political purposes [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1032.76s)]
*  as the Trump administration so correctly did [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1035.0s)]
*  by taking the anger and animosity that people felt [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1037.52s)]
*  and then saying you're angry [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1040.32s)]
*  not because your boss is fucking you over. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1042.48s)]
*  Can I curse here? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1044.52s)]
*  I don't, is that allowed? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1045.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1046.92s)]
*  It's too late for that. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1047.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1048.5800000000002s)]
*  You're angry not because your boss is screwing you over [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1049.42s)]
*  but you're angry because they're trans people. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1053.44s)]
*  You're angry because undocumented migrants exist [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1055.2s)]
*  on US soil and they're able to build on that anger [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1058.56s)]
*  whereas the Democrats I think were so uninterested [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1064.92s)]
*  in recognizing that where they thought like, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1070.6000000000001s)]
*  oh, it's a vibe session. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1072.76s)]
*  Like, oh, people are not feeling the pain in their wallets. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1074.04s)]
*  It's gonna go away. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1077.24s)]
*  And no matter how many think pieces you write on that, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1078.76s)]
*  like the average person is not, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1082.04s)]
*  like that's not gonna change the average person [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1084.5s)]
*  experiencing negative real wage growth [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1086.0600000000002s)]
*  for almost two years under the Biden administration. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1088.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1091.64s)]
*  I mean, I think this is where there was a lot of overlap [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1092.48s)]
*  in our work and what you were talking about [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1094.04s)]
*  is because that kind of 2021, 2022 moment [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1096.6000000000001s)]
*  when Democrats were trying to talk people [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1100.68s)]
*  out of their concerns really sticks out [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1101.52s)]
*  in terms of the reasons why they lost. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1103.6s)]
*  But I guess I'm just wanna clarify, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1105.12s)]
*  am I hearing that you think more Democrats lost [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1107.12s)]
*  more themselves than Donald Trump won? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1109.6s)]
*  Because there's another argument you could say [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1110.8799999999999s)]
*  which is that he was affirmatively [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1112.48s)]
*  kind of shifting the electorate [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1114.3999999999999s)]
*  rather than it was the Democrats failures at Central. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1115.9199999999998s)]
*  No, I think there's always a push and pull. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1118.2s)]
*  And yes, for that reason, I think the Democrats [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1120.76s)]
*  were definitely responsible for their own defeat, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1123.26s)]
*  for their own demise. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1126.1s)]
*  And they were responsible not in the campaign cycle, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1127.48s)]
*  they were responsible early on. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1129.8600000000001s)]
*  I went back and looked at my earlier reporting [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1132.88s)]
*  in like the month of February in 2021 [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1134.76s)]
*  where immigration was becoming a problem. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1138.2s)]
*  We had that image of custom border patrol [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1140.96s)]
*  on a horseback like whipping Haitian migrants [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1143.84s)]
*  at the border in Texas. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1146.72s)]
*  And I remember even back then saying like, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1148.32s)]
*  if they don't actually go along with the mandate [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1150.32s)]
*  that they had, with the mandate that Biden had [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1154.0s)]
*  on his first 100 days of immigration, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1156.56s)]
*  where he was talking about building pathways for amnesty [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  and all these things, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1161.52s)]
*  if they don't actually fulfill those promises [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1164.2s)]
*  and they don't counter message against the Republicans [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1166.72s)]
*  on this issue, they're gonna keep hammering this button [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1169.12s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1171.48s)]
*  And the media is absolutely gonna go along with it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1172.7s)]
*  And lo and behold, that's precisely what happened [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1175.6799999999998s)]
*  three years after that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1177.56s)]
*  You had Biden on October 6th coming out and saying [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1179.46s)]
*  that they were unveiling this incredibly draconian, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1184.2s)]
*  incredibly right-wing, white nativist, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1188.24s)]
*  anti-immigrant agenda package that they said, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1190.96s)]
*  that a Oklahoma senator wrote. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1194.04s)]
*  And it was basically Trump's 2020 immigration agenda [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1197.1200000000001s)]
*  repackaged and being sold to the American public [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1201.92s)]
*  as a democratic bill. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1205.0s)]
*  After eight years of constantly yelling at Republicans [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1206.64s)]
*  for being racist, for wanting to build a stupid border wall, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1209.52s)]
*  now they wanted to fund the border wall. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1212.2s)]
*  And that is at the heart of the Democratic Party's failure, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1214.44s)]
*  that they don't actually showcase a vision [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1219.28s)]
*  for a better future, and they shy away from policies [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1222.2s)]
*  that will improve people's material conditions. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1226.48s)]
*  And obviously part of that is because they're captured [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1229.44s)]
*  by the same corporate interests as the Republicans are. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1231.72s)]
*  But Republicans and the social issues [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1234.28s)]
*  that they can hammer on, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  the culture war issues that they can hammer on [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1238.52s)]
*  are way more appealing than the culture war issues [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1241.72s)]
*  that the Democrats tried to engage [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1244.24s)]
*  in a defensive posture over, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1246.2s)]
*  especially because they're not earnest [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1247.96s)]
*  in that defense either. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1249.52s)]
*  They're no more earnest on defending trans people [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1251.2s)]
*  than like Target is when they roll out [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1253.5600000000002s)]
*  LGBTQ friendly baby onesies once a year [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1256.76s)]
*  in the month of, is it July? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1261.28s)]
*  I don't even know when Pride Month is, June. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1262.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm never defeating the allegations. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1265.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm like. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1267.0800000000002s)]
*  I say I'm a LGBT foe all the time, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1269.0s)]
*  there you go. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1271.84s)]
*  But it's just for them, it's hollow, it's not real. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1274.12s)]
*  It's not a real battle that they wanna fight. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1278.16s)]
*  And they constantly find themselves [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1280.24s)]
*  in this defensive posture, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1281.72s)]
*  and they allow the Republicans that dominate discourse. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1283.44s)]
*  They allow Republicans to lead on issues that they can win. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1286.72s)]
*  But I'm gonna push there [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1292.04s)]
*  because isn't there also a public opinion problem here? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1293.76s)]
*  The reason that Biden was moderating on immigration [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1296.48s)]
*  was not just because of Republicans, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1299.6s)]
*  but because of a legitimate shift among public sentiment [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1301.48s)]
*  that Americans were growing more conservative [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1304.28s)]
*  when the issue. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1306.1599999999999s)]
*  The reason they have, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1307.0s)]
*  you see the Gavin Newsom's of the world [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1308.76s)]
*  kind of flipping their opinion on trans, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1310.6399999999999s)]
*  it's partially because there is numbers that tell you [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1312.52s)]
*  that that's where the country is. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1315.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, sometimes I hear leftist talk [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1316.6799999999998s)]
*  as if there's this like unrealized mass of leftists [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1319.6s)]
*  that just hasn't been activated. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1322.8s)]
*  Is that true or is that a matter of convincing a public? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1324.36s)]
*  It's a matter of convincing the public. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1327.6399999999999s)]
*  It has nothing to do with like how woke everyone is [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1329.08s)]
*  secretly deep down inside [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1332.28s)]
*  and like activating their potential or whatever. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  And everything to do with the fact that you have to [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1335.84s)]
*  constantly engage in counter messaging [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1339.12s)]
*  and you have to constantly engage in messaging. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1340.8799999999999s)]
*  And also on top of that, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1343.0s)]
*  you have to have a unified agenda [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1343.9199999999998s)]
*  that touches every single person. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1345.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's why class politics is so important. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1347.56s)]
*  And I think that's the reason why now you see [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1350.28s)]
*  the Democrats actually leaning on [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1352.9199999999998s)]
*  the Bernie Sanders style of commentary [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1354.1599999999999s)]
*  where they're like, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  they're trying to do a fake class first politics as well. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1357.0s)]
*  But even Bernie himself is actually kind of, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1360.16s)]
*  I mean, he's 800 years old, no disrespect. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1363.28s)]
*  But even he finds himself like coming across [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1365.96s)]
*  as a little bit right wing on some of these issues as well. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1369.48s)]
*  But I'm of the belief that, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1372.08s)]
*  I wanna talk about two things when it comes to immigration. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1376.24s)]
*  Number one is there's always two different polls [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1378.4s)]
*  that people never actually react to [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1381.44s)]
*  when talking about immigration. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1383.24s)]
*  Even at a time when you had the highest approval rating [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1385.08s)]
*  for Trump's mass deportation agenda, right? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1388.08s)]
*  I mean, this is straight Hitlerian policy, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  like mass deportation of 20 million people, that's insane. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1393.56s)]
*  You're gonna put them in concentration camps? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1396.28s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1397.48s)]
*  Even at that point, when Americans were consistently asked [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1399.04s)]
*  mass immigration or mass amnesty, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1402.3999999999999s)]
*  they still chose mass amnesty. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1404.4399999999998s)]
*  But no one ever presents that second option [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1406.28s)]
*  as a viable solution to this problem. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1408.48s)]
*  And that is at the heart of the issue [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1410.84s)]
*  from the way I see it, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1415.4399999999998s)]
*  where if you don't present Americans with the other option, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1416.52s)]
*  if you don't constantly counter message, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1419.48s)]
*  if you don't actually do your very best [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1420.8799999999999s)]
*  to showcase the humanity of migrants [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1423.52s)]
*  and how much they contribute to these communities, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1426.4399999999998s)]
*  then of course, Republicans are going to [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1429.08s)]
*  constantly counter message and talk about [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  some of the most heinous, some of the most violent things [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1435.9599999999998s)]
*  that have taken place and attribute that to migrants [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1438.08s)]
*  across the board, even though there's no evidence [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1440.04s)]
*  that shows that undocumented immigrants [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1442.88s)]
*  are responsible for a larger share of crime [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1444.96s)]
*  than natural born US citizens [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  and only evidence to show the exact opposite, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1448.48s)]
*  that they're responsible for less crime per capita [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1451.0s)]
*  than natural born US citizens are. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1453.0s)]
*  So Democrats never make that argument. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1455.0s)]
*  And I think it's because they're afraid. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1458.16s)]
*  I go back and forth. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1460.5200000000002s)]
*  I sometimes think they're controlled opposition [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1461.48s)]
*  and then other times I realize whenever I talk to a Democrat [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1463.24s)]
*  or a staffer, I'm like, oh, you're just stupid. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1466.0400000000002s)]
*  Like, you just don't know. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1468.0s)]
*  You just don't believe in yourself [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1469.44s)]
*  and you're just posturing [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1471.24s)]
*  as a somewhat progressive figure on certain issues [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1475.36s)]
*  in an effort to win votes, but that's it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1479.92s)]
*  Like, it's not genuine. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1482.44s)]
*  You know, you mentioned the kind of primacy [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  of class politics, which obviously is a theme in your work. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1485.52s)]
*  I remember when Bernie was making some of these arguments [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1488.44s)]
*  in the 2016 and 2020 race. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1490.72s)]
*  And I also remember when he ran into big problems [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1492.88s)]
*  in places like South Carolina and others [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1494.88s)]
*  where that argument wasn't really landing. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  How much does the left need to win over [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1498.96s)]
*  working class folks of color who haven't really come [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1502.0s)]
*  to them in the same type of way? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1504.32s)]
*  And what is the balance between recognizing class politics [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1505.68s)]
*  and the importance of identity politics [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1508.1200000000001s)]
*  and representation to some folks? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1509.92s)]
*  Yeah, you and I actually had this conversation [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1511.4s)]
*  on my stream where we were talking about [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1514.52s)]
*  like the Democrat machine and how strong it is. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1516.4s)]
*  I also had another conversation similar to this [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1520.68s)]
*  with my friend FD Signifier, shouts out. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1522.4s)]
*  He's a wonderful YouTuber [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1524.72s)]
*  about how like the black aunties are the backbone [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1527.28s)]
*  of the Democratic party, right? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1530.8s)]
*  Like, and they are- [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1532.4s)]
*  And the world. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1534.28s)]
*  Yeah, yes, exactly, for sure. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1535.1200000000001s)]
*  And what I was interested in understanding is like, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1538.4s)]
*  I think a lot of people of color understand [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1544.48s)]
*  that it's about survival. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1550.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's about the demon that you know [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1553.64s)]
*  as opposed to the demon that you don't. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1555.72s)]
*  And in most circumstances, they make this decision [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1557.44s)]
*  knowing full well that like the people [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1561.3600000000001s)]
*  that they're voting for are not, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1563.24s)]
*  I mean, they're maybe marginally less racist [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1565.32s)]
*  than the other side that's like overtly racist, right? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1567.52s)]
*  And I think that because there's so much strategic voting [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1570.72s)]
*  that takes place in that regard, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1575.48s)]
*  I think as long as you can make it out of the primary, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1577.32s)]
*  out of the primary structure, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1580.04s)]
*  like a figure no matter how populous they are, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1581.16s)]
*  no matter how like left leaning they are, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1585.4s)]
*  no matter how predisposed with class politics they are, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1586.92s)]
*  we'll be able to captivate the attention [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1589.96s)]
*  of like the base of the Democratic party. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1591.52s)]
*  Like they, people that find themselves in a position [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1593.76s)]
*  where they're voting for Joe Biden, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1597.0s)]
*  whether because they love Joe Biden [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1598.76s)]
*  or because they think that he's a safer bet [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  are definitely still going to vote [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1604.96s)]
*  for whoever the Democrat is. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1607.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the base of support [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1609.0800000000002s)]
*  that we can bring over [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1612.64s)]
*  rather than try to craft a message specifically [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1614.64s)]
*  for that base of support. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1618.1200000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1619.4s)]
*  You mentioned the scenes of first Trump administration, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1620.24s)]
*  specifically I remember the whip and the immigration moment. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1622.92s)]
*  I think about that time too [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1625.3600000000001s)]
*  because there was so much public pushback [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1626.48s)]
*  on some of those things. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1628.0s)]
*  I remember folks going to the airports [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1628.88s)]
*  when the Muslim ban dropped and things. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1631.0s)]
*  Do you still see that same leveling of engagement? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1632.92s)]
*  I imagine like you're on the, you know, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1635.2s)]
*  you're on the pulse of the resistance maybe, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1637.4s)]
*  like why aren't people in the streets? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1639.28s)]
*  That's actually really your question. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1640.92s)]
*  I think that there's two problems. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1642.4s)]
*  One is the disillusionment that people feel [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1645.5600000000002s)]
*  because I think in the aftermath [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1648.16s)]
*  of the Black Lives Matter protests that took place in 2020 [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1650.48s)]
*  where a lot of people in this room [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1653.8400000000001s)]
*  did all of the right things. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1655.8000000000002s)]
*  Like you did it by the book. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1658.0s)]
*  You went out, you protested in the streets, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1659.48s)]
*  you yelled, you yelled at your congress persons, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1662.3600000000001s)]
*  you tweeted, okay, you did it all. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1665.04s)]
*  And then when the election came around, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1667.5600000000002s)]
*  you went out and you voted. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1670.2s)]
*  You voted, you held your nose and you voted for Joe Biden [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1671.16s)]
*  even though he was very visibly deteriorating [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1673.8400000000001s)]
*  and it didn't matter because it was like, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1676.4s)]
*  it's better than Trump, right? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1677.52s)]
*  And then nothing came of that. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1679.52s)]
*  And I feel like that creates a lot of disillusionment [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1681.96s)]
*  amongst young people and just virtually any American [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1686.0s)]
*  that participated in this process that looked at that [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1688.8000000000002s)]
*  and went, well, we saw no reforms whatsoever on policing. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1691.48s)]
*  And as a matter of fact, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1695.16s)]
*  most of the Democrats were predisposed with like [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1696.1200000000001s)]
*  positioning themselves as against these organic movements [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1700.68s)]
*  that were born out of Black Lives Matter. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1704.8000000000002s)]
*  And surely there was people going maybe a little too far [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1706.88s)]
*  in terms of maybe not putting [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1710.24s)]
*  their least radical positions out there. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1713.24s)]
*  But overall, I think that that created a lot of nihilism [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1715.76s)]
*  that we haven't really examined thoroughly. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1719.8000000000002s)]
*  So that's one reason why I don't think a lot of people [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1722.6000000000001s)]
*  are even protesting Trump to the same degree [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1724.72s)]
*  as they were last time around. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1727.0s)]
*  Because last time around, he was also seen as an aberration. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1729.64s)]
*  Like this is not us when this definitely was us. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1731.92s)]
*  Like Trump is a perfect beacon of American stupidity. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1735.08s)]
*  And- [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1740.32s)]
*  It always bothered me when people say like, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1741.16s)]
*  this is not, I'm like, what is democracy otherwise? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1742.76s)]
*  No, this is- [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1745.2s)]
*  Then like, this is us. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1746.04s)]
*  No, that was definitely us. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  And it still is us. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1748.08s)]
*  But I think in terms of the immigration, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1749.8s)]
*  like the conversation definitely shifted to the right [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1752.76s)]
*  due to very little interest from the Democrats [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1755.68s)]
*  in terms of counter messaging. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1759.44s)]
*  And they went, they got completely captive [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1761.24s)]
*  to white native sentiment. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1763.88s)]
*  And if you recall, you and I had another conversation [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1766.64s)]
*  when you brought up your followup on the Run Up podcast [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1769.0400000000002s)]
*  where you talked to these people and you were like, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1772.6000000000001s)]
*  what are you worried about right now? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1774.68s)]
*  And if you told me that immigration was not [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1776.0800000000002s)]
*  at the forefront of anyone's mind pretty much. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1778.68s)]
*  And I told you then, and it started to happen already, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1781.0s)]
*  that eventually it will because people are gonna start [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1783.8799999999999s)]
*  developing too much resentment towards this administration's [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1787.28s)]
*  unjustifiable immigrant detention policies. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1789.84s)]
*  And since we had that conversation, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  he's underwater even on that issue as well. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1794.72s)]
*  And the reason why that happened is because [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1797.1999999999998s)]
*  they made a major mistake with Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1799.32s)]
*  They detained and refused to do due process [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1804.32s)]
*  for virtually all of these migrants [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1810.32s)]
*  that they had captured and sent to CICOT [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1812.72s)]
*  into this like slave labor prison structure in El Salvador. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1815.84s)]
*  And yet an immigration attorney of the Trump administration [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1821.48s)]
*  accidentally revealed that they had made a mistake. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1824.68s)]
*  And when that happened, the media seized on that. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1827.32s)]
*  They started covering it. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1829.26s)]
*  And then it became a major issue of consequence. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1830.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, a major issue that people were demanding [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1833.16s)]
*  some sort of restitution for. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1838.84s)]
*  And the Trump administration being hardheaded, refused. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1841.72s)]
*  And it led to Chris Van Hollen actually going down [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1846.4s)]
*  to El Salvador to get proof of life for this person. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1849.24s)]
*  And in that process, I think a lot more Americans were made, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1852.4s)]
*  a lot more Americans started realizing [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1855.88s)]
*  what was truly happening. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1857.64s)]
*  Because they're busy, everyone is busy. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  They're focusing on their own lives. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  They've completely checked out of politics. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1863.58s)]
*  But when an issue becomes noteworthy enough [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1865.24s)]
*  that a lot of outlets are covering it, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1868.76s)]
*  Americans still do have a conscious, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1872.04s)]
*  a collective conscious where they go, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1873.44s)]
*  okay, that's really messed up. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1874.72s)]
*  And we shouldn't let that happen. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1877.0s)]
*  And that momentum is only going to build from this point on [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1879.3600000000001s)]
*  because it's not like the Trump administration [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1884.52s)]
*  is going to back away from doing [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1886.16s)]
*  these unjustifiable detention policies. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1887.8s)]
*  And it's only going to escalate further. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1892.4s)]
*  And then you'll start seeing more protests in the streets. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1895.38s)]
*  One more question on Democrats before we move on. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1898.28s)]
*  There's another argument I've heard some folks say [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1900.8s)]
*  that it wasn't a message, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1902.6399999999999s)]
*  it was just that they weren't in the right places. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1903.72s)]
*  Like they hadn't actually bring those to people. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1906.1599999999999s)]
*  That Democrats have kind of lost culture [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1908.24s)]
*  more than it is a need for policy shift. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1909.72s)]
*  I know your team, they need to change their policies. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1911.84s)]
*  But if we're just focusing on kind of [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1914.3s)]
*  where they deliver their message, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1915.8s)]
*  how do they get back into culture? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1918.0s)]
*  They should just go on Call Her Daddy. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1920.96s)]
*  That was good. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1923.28s)]
*  I have no disrespect to Call Her Daddy, but you know. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1925.12s)]
*  It's just, I don't think you can. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1928.64s)]
*  I mean to that point, I remember that interview [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1931.88s)]
*  as like a moment when Democrats were bringing [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1933.48s)]
*  their same message just to a new place, right? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1935.92s)]
*  That seems like part of the problem. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1938.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but if the message is shit, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1940.16s)]
*  it's not gonna resonate with people. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1943.16s)]
*  Like Kamala Harris's brilliant campaign message [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1945.44s)]
*  was like $50,000 in tax breaks for small businesses. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1948.8000000000002s)]
*  Like she kept saying, I am a small business, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1953.22s)]
*  I love small businesses. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1955.2800000000002s)]
*  It was like, that doesn't resonate with people [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1956.2800000000002s)]
*  that are having a hard time struggling to pay their bills. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1958.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1960.84s)]
*  You really think people vote on policy first? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  I think people vote on an earnest communicator [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1964.0s)]
*  that can promise them a better life. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1966.8999999999999s)]
*  And that is not what the Democrats do in general. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1969.04s)]
*  One, they never come across as earnest. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1973.6799999999998s)]
*  They come across as entitled, smug, elitist. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1975.9199999999998s)]
*  And also two, the policies are far too technocratic [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1978.82s)]
*  in their approach. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1983.0s)]
*  Like look at Elizabeth Warren versus Bernie Sanders [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1983.84s)]
*  as an example. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1987.04s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren is, and she's done fantastic work [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1988.8s)]
*  with like Lena Conn for example. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1990.64s)]
*  And on the back end, on the policy side, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1992.4s)]
*  like CFPB is brilliant, it's fantastic. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1994.92s)]
*  But Elizabeth Warren is a campaigner, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1998.04s)]
*  unfortunately, is a freaking nerd. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=1999.72s)]
*  It's just not, that's gonna resonate well [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2002.8400000000001s)]
*  with like people on Twitter. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2005.24s)]
*  That's gonna resonate well with like [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2007.32s)]
*  college educated people. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2008.68s)]
*  But no one, you're not making an impact [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2010.3s)]
*  with like regular Americans. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2013.28s)]
*  You're not, if you're messaging discipline, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2015.44s)]
*  and you're not, if you're messaging [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2018.52s)]
*  and you're not talking about like [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2019.76s)]
*  the way that Bernie did it, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2021.76s)]
*  which is why I think he saw a lot more success. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2023.08s)]
*  I wanted you to tell, you know you mentioned [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2025.4s)]
*  you being detained at O'Hare yesterday. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2028.48s)]
*  I wanted you to talk about that story [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2030.72s)]
*  and tell me some of, tell me about that experience [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2033.16s)]
*  and some of the questions I asked you. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2035.72s)]
*  Okay, yeah, great reception from Chicago. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2036.96s)]
*  I will say, last time I was here [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2040.96s)]
*  I got kicked out of DNC this time. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2042.84s)]
*  This time I got apprehended. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2044.92s)]
*  We're with the Pope's country, we're blessed. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2046.7600000000002s)]
*  You can't bring us down right now. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2048.56s)]
*  They're gonna arrest the Pope when he steps foot. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2051.56s)]
*  They're gonna be like, what'd you say about JD Vance? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2054.2400000000002s)]
*  But tell us what happened. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2057.76s)]
*  So I knew that this was probably gonna happen. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2059.08s)]
*  I'd seen a lot of TikToks of people talking about [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2062.2000000000003s)]
*  how like they got detained as American citizens [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2064.12s)]
*  at the border and I was like joking about it. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2067.12s)]
*  But I, deep down inside I was like, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2069.32s)]
*  I'm probably gonna get arrested. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2070.96s)]
*  But I, deep down inside I was like, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2072.68s)]
*  I'm probably gonna, this is probably gonna happen [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2074.3199999999997s)]
*  to me eventually. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2076.08s)]
*  And this was my first entry into the country [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2077.3999999999996s)]
*  with global entry as well. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2080.68s)]
*  So I have global entry for those of you who don't know. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2082.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a, you go to the Department of Homeland Security [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2083.9199999999996s)]
*  and they let you like, it's like a fast pass. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2086.16s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2089.08s)]
*  We've Disneyland commodified everything. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2089.9199999999996s)]
*  But yeah, I'm supposed to be like a good traveler. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2093.56s)]
*  Which is why they, you know, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2096.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm supposed to cut the line, right? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2098.2s)]
*  And I did that. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2100.68s)]
*  I went through global entry, took my photo. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2102.96s)]
*  Everyone's getting waved away. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2105.2799999999997s)]
*  And then as soon as I got to the Customs and Border Patrol, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2106.72s)]
*  the lady was like, step aside sir. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2110.8799999999997s)]
*  I was like, oh, here we fucking go. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2112.52s)]
*  I'm just, okay. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2114.44s)]
*  And I did. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2115.64s)]
*  They took me to the back room into a detention center. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2116.96s)]
*  I asked around when I was inside [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2119.9199999999996s)]
*  like if people had American passports. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2122.44s)]
*  Most of the people there did not. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2124.3199999999997s)]
*  They were traveling from outside of the country. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2125.68s)]
*  They weren't American citizens. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2128.7599999999998s)]
*  I saw one American passport in the detention center [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2131.48s)]
*  for one of the people. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2136.08s)]
*  And they would basically periodically come out. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2137.2799999999997s)]
*  Agents would come out and be like, all right, you know, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2138.88s)]
*  your name and then you can leave. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2140.72s)]
*  But I was sent to the back room. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  An agent came out and took me into the interrogation room [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2146.72s)]
*  and it was a very creepy fluorescent light bulb environment [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2150.7599999999998s)]
*  where like everything was steel. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2156.6s)]
*  Like all the seating arrangements were steel [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2158.32s)]
*  and bolted into the ground. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2161.04s)]
*  And they started asking me about these, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2163.1600000000003s)]
*  they started asking me about crazy shit [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2165.8s)]
*  like do you like Donald Trump? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2167.4s)]
*  They asked you directly, do you like Donald Trump? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2170.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they were like, what do you think about Donald Trump? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2172.0s)]
*  And I was like, why are you asking me this? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2173.52s)]
*  What does this have to do with anything? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2175.04s)]
*  And they just kept asking and prodding [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2176.6000000000004s)]
*  and asking me about Hamas. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2179.52s)]
*  And do I think Hamas is a resistance group? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2181.4s)]
*  Or if it's actually a terrorist group, are they bad guys? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2183.96s)]
*  What do you think about Israel? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2186.36s)]
*  What do you think about the war? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2187.2000000000003s)]
*  Now you're engaging in like a discussion here or what? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2189.08s)]
*  Well, I just kept repeating whenever he asked me [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2191.48s)]
*  about Hamas, I was like, they are designated [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2193.3599999999997s)]
*  by the State Department as a terrorist group. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2194.8399999999997s)]
*  But like, I mean, the substance doesn't really matter. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2199.04s)]
*  I'm not just asking about like, you know, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2201.8799999999997s)]
*  what is the pretense of why that is, you know, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2203.3999999999996s)]
*  restricting you from getting in? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2206.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's illegal for him [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2207.9199999999996s)]
*  to even ask me those questions. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2209.8799999999997s)]
*  Like they can't deny me entry into my own country for like, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2211.12s)]
*  even if I was like, I love Hamas, they can't do that. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2213.96s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2216.3999999999996s)]
*  This is America. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2217.52s)]
*  How long did it last? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2218.6s)]
*  The whole process took over about two hours. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2220.3199999999997s)]
*  And they went back and forth. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2224.04s)]
*  Like there was a point where he asked me all these questions, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2225.52s)]
*  like including drama, which was crazy. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2227.52s)]
*  Like he was like, well, it says here, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2230.4399999999996s)]
*  you got banned off Twitch. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2232.56s)]
*  I was like, bro, you're an agent of the federal government. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2236.08s)]
*  What do you mean I got banned off Twitch? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2238.68s)]
*  Like, what are you a Redditor? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2240.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, it was insane. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2242.0s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, care to explain that? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2244.2799999999997s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I got banned off Twitch [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2246.48s)]
*  for describing the concept of blowback. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2248.04s)]
*  And that's the most positive way that I could tell him [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2250.88s)]
*  that I said America deserved 9-11 [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2254.28s)]
*  without him apprehending me. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2255.76s)]
*  But, and then he's like, well, it says here [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2258.4s)]
*  that you wanted to kill a senator? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2259.88s)]
*  And I was like, no, that's not what I meant. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2264.32s)]
*  I was talking about like the Republicans [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2265.88s)]
*  being hypocritical. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2267.12s)]
*  Basically he left, he came back, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2269.16s)]
*  and then he asked me like the hard-hitting questions. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2270.8s)]
*  Like if you say yes to those, you're going to jail. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2273.04s)]
*  Where he was like, have you ever been in contact [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2275.32s)]
*  with someone in Hamas or Hezbollah or Houthis? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2277.1200000000003s)]
*  I was like, no, I was like laughing at this point. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2279.6000000000004s)]
*  I was like, no, I have not been. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2281.4s)]
*  Do you have their number? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2283.36s)]
*  Like. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2284.56s)]
*  And after that, basically at a certain point, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2285.4s)]
*  I was like, am I being detained? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, what's going on? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2293.36s)]
*  And he was like, no, not at all. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2294.48s)]
*  I was like, so I can leave if I want to? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2296.0800000000004s)]
*  He was like, oh, well, you know. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2298.1600000000003s)]
*  And then they didn't even, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2300.04s)]
*  he didn't even ask me for my phone after that, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2301.56s)]
*  because that was my red line. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2304.2799999999997s)]
*  I wanted to test the boundaries. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2305.68s)]
*  I didn't like immediately lawyer up or anything, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2307.04s)]
*  because I wanted to see like what they were going to ask me, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2308.92s)]
*  because I do have a decent amount of privilege [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2311.8399999999997s)]
*  as opposed to like a random college activist, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2313.96s)]
*  you know what I mean, who can be bullied in that situation. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2316.12s)]
*  I wanted to test like what they would ask [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2319.48s)]
*  and what they would prod about. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2321.48s)]
*  And it was shocking. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2323.12s)]
*  Like it was shocking that these were questions [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2324.6s)]
*  that they were asking me as though like [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2326.3599999999997s)]
*  they're going to deny me entry into the country. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2327.68s)]
*  That is definitely worth entry. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2330.2799999999997s)]
*  We have 10 minutes before audience questions. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2333.32s)]
*  So y'all keep that in mind. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2335.0800000000004s)]
*  And I think we're going to start putting some of the mics out. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2336.76s)]

*  I mean, you mentioned some of the back and forth. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2365.48s)]
*  There was a statement from the Chicago Jewels Alliance. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2367.8s)]
*  I'm going to read to you and will love for you to respond to. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2369.7200000000003s)]

*  including America deserved 9-11, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2374.6s)]
*  a remark that trivializes national tragedy, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2376.96s)]
*  referring to Israelis. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2379.2000000000003s)]

*  that echoes historical and systematic stereotypes, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2386.88s)]
*  dismissing reports of sexual violence [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2390.24s)]
*  in the October 7th Amos attacks, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2392.16s)]

*  Such statements have prompted concern for public officials. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2398.16s)]
*  And they mentioned some other folks [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2400.64s)]
*  by inviting Piker to speak here in Chicago, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2401.9599999999996s)]

*  Okay. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2420.92s)]
*  Yeah, the fact that people still use that quote [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2424.96s)]
*  when I say it doesn't matter what happened on October 7th [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2428.48s)]
*  that doesn't change the dynamic for me is so revealing [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2431.08s)]
*  because Israel is committing a genocide. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2434.64s)]
*  And my position on this is clear [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2437.64s)]
*  that whatever happened on October 7th, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  the atrocities that took place on October 7th [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2442.44s)]
*  does not justify genocide. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2444.72s)]

*  Like, and that's what's so alarming [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2454.8s)]
*  that people will say that all the time. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2457.48s)]
*  Like, people will put that in the free press [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2461.1200000000003s)]
*  or daily mail or whenever there's a hit piece [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2463.2400000000002s)]
*  written from the smear rags in general. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2465.96s)]
*  And I'm always confused by that [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2469.5600000000004s)]
*  because I'm like, what are you saying? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2472.0800000000004s)]
*  So you're saying that it does justify genocide? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2473.28s)]
*  Like, it's always come across as very confusing to me. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2475.44s)]
*  And overall, yeah, I am someone [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2478.4s)]
*  who is firmly committed to combating anti-Semitism [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2484.64s)]
*  for my past decade of work. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2488.28s)]
*  I've been doxed and swatted by neo-Nazis in perpetuity [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2490.96s)]
*  for this reason. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2495.0s)]
*  But I also happen to be a committed anti-Zionist [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2496.76s)]
*  that I believe in the emancipatory cause for Palestinians. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2499.32s)]
*  And I've never shied away from that position, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2504.16s)]
*  no matter what. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2507.3199999999997s)]
*  But something like America Deserve 9-11 [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2508.8799999999997s)]
*  is obviously at least inflammatory. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2510.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2512.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, do you ever think about the impact of those words? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2513.2s)]
*  And do you have to... [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2516.96s)]
*  I know it's an informal forum, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2518.08s)]
*  you're kind of rolling with it live. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2519.44s)]
*  Like, how do you wrestle with something [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2520.96s)]
*  that could be offhand, but actually be more meaningful? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2524.16s)]
*  Actually be more hurtful, I should say. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2527.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that... [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2530.0s)]
*  America Deserve 9-11 in general [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2533.44s)]
*  was probably one of my most vindicated takes. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2535.36s)]
*  Maybe I'm delusional about it, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2538.56s)]
*  but in terms of describing the concept of blowback [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2540.04s)]
*  and explaining how we got to 9-11, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2543.76s)]
*  a lot of people were unaware [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2548.12s)]
*  of the machinations behind the scenes [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2549.6800000000003s)]
*  from Operation Cyclone, or even before that, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2552.52s)]
*  even prior to that, in terms of arming [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2555.32s)]
*  and radicalizing the Mujahideen [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2558.1600000000003s)]
*  and using them in the Afghan Civil War [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2560.2400000000002s)]
*  against the USSR, and what that turned into. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2563.04s)]
*  That is a common thread in American foreign policy, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2570.12s)]
*  is that people that we give arms to [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2573.8s)]
*  and offer a lot of training and support to [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2576.52s)]
*  inevitably turn on us for understandable reasons. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2580.44s)]
*  So I don't shy... [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2583.88s)]
*  Like, even if I say something [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2585.6s)]
*  that is hyperbolic in that moment, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2587.64s)]
*  because I get passionate sometimes, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2589.84s)]
*  and I have what people call a heated gaming moment, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2591.72s)]
*  ultimately, my message is clear. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2598.4399999999996s)]
*  And does that get in the way [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2601.24s)]
*  of me reaching a broader audience? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2602.9199999999996s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2604.48s)]
*  I understand that, but it happens. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2605.6s)]
*  It happens sometimes. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2609.8399999999997s)]
*  So I hear you more have made peace with it [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2610.9599999999996s)]
*  than think it's a thing that you're gonna... [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2613.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm like, I'm trying to stay away from it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2615.3199999999997s)]
*  A heated gaming moment for a lot of folks [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2616.9599999999996s)]
*  is just a heated gaming moment. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2618.68s)]
*  For you, it's a big audience. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2620.04s)]
*  So I'm saying, have you changed [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2622.2s)]
*  the way you think about those things? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2623.44s)]
*  For sure. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2624.92s)]
*  Especially because I don't really appreciate [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2626.52s)]
*  all the doxing that comes afterwards [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2628.88s)]
*  and the swatting that comes afterwards, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2631.32s)]
*  but it's definitely something that gets away [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2632.96s)]
*  in the message that I'm trying to... [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2637.12s)]
*  And so for that reason, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2639.8s)]
*  I do try to moderate every now and then [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2642.2s)]
*  or try to regulate my temperature every now and then [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2644.52s)]
*  when I find myself saying something [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2648.04s)]
*  that might easily be misconstrued or is explosive. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2650.88s)]
*  But overall, mistakes still happen. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2656.12s)]
*  I'm a human being. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2659.68s)]
*  I own up to it. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2660.52s)]
*  And that was one of those moments. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2662.72s)]
*  Last question I have, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2665.6s)]
*  and then we'll go to the audience questions. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2666.44s)]
*  So much of your life is lived publicly. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2667.96s)]
*  I find it kind of shocking. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2670.08s)]
*  How much just living out there you do. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2674.24s)]
*  How folks really come to understand you, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2678.24s)]
*  have a relationship with you because of that. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2679.44s)]
*  I wanted to ask, what's something we don't know? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2681.16s)]
*  What's a misunderstanding about you? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2682.96s)]
*  What's something you've kept to yourself? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2684.48s)]
*  And how have you regulated that? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2687.12s)]
*  Ooh, that's interesting. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2689.44s)]
*  That's not a question that I thought I'd be answering. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2691.24s)]
*  I mean, everything is online, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2694.68s)]
*  except for I guess personal relationships that I have. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2696.3599999999997s)]
*  I try to keep private to the best of my ability [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2699.2799999999997s)]
*  because I don't want to invite unwelcome attention [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2701.12s)]
*  to other people because I can deal with it, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2703.96s)]
*  but not everyone is equipped or should be equipped [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2706.84s)]
*  to deal with that sort of stuff. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2709.6000000000004s)]
*  In terms of something about me that people don't know, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2712.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know, I'm drawing a blank. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2719.04s)]
*  I would say that I've never had a position [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  where I think people should not have nice things. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2727.6400000000003s)]
*  That's the number one thing that people always be like, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2730.84s)]
*  oh, rich socialist, what a hypocrite. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2733.56s)]
*  No, I want everyone to be able to have [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2736.52s)]
*  enough disposable income so they can buy stupid shit. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2739.44s)]
*  So that's I guess one of the most common misconceptions, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2742.4s)]
*  but I think people in this audience [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2745.68s)]
*  probably already knew my position on this [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2747.12s)]
*  because you guys probably tune in every now and then. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2748.7999999999997s)]
*  You're pro-nice stuff. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2751.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think, and stupid shit too. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2752.3199999999997s)]
*  Not just nice stuff, things that make you feel good. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2755.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna ask you this question again in a little bit. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2758.68s)]
*  How much do you think of a better answer? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2760.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2761.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2762.12s)]
*  We're gonna go to audience questions. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2762.96s)]
*  Remember, questions have a question mark at the end. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2766.04s)]
*  They're not statements, and we're gonna try to keep them [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2768.2799999999997s)]
*  as brief as possible, but please, let's go. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2770.32s)]
*  Hello, my name is Alex Quentos. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2773.32s)]
*  I'm a second year at the college. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2774.84s)]
*  I am Salvadoran-American, so the immigration issue [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2776.48s)]
*  is very close to me. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2779.92s)]
*  I'm gonna shoot you a softball. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2781.04s)]
*  So the issue I face with working within the city [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2783.64s)]
*  is that a lot of people have felt not very invested in [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2787.68s)]
*  or other communities have not been very invested in. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2790.24s)]
*  So when we look at Amnesty or looking at these programs [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2793.04s)]
*  for immigration, they face a lot of pushback. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2795.68s)]
*  So what do you say to that kind of person? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2798.88s)]
*  How do you fight the immigration issue as a Democrat [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2801.44s)]
*  when talking to those kind of people? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2806.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not a softball. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2808.52s)]
*  It was a tough one. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2810.08s)]
*  Because unfortunately, you're not wrong. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2811.4s)]
*  I think a lot of people, like I said, are so busy [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2814.04s)]
*  with whatever is going on in their lives [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2816.36s)]
*  that they sometimes will be very selfish. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2817.92s)]
*  And they refuse to contend with the reality [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2821.56s)]
*  that migrants undocumented and documented alike [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2825.2799999999997s)]
*  are all around us, and there are very important parts [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2828.84s)]
*  of our community. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2831.84s)]
*  And I feel like the best you can do in that regard [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2833.52s)]
*  is to showcase the humanity of the people [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2836.52s)]
*  that you're talking about and try to present that [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2839.16s)]
*  to the best of your ability over and over again [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2844.2799999999997s)]
*  and keep hammering on that point. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2846.32s)]
*  And this isn't the best time to be able to do that either [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2848.7200000000003s)]
*  because understandably, a lot of undocumented migrants [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2853.0s)]
*  especially are trying to hide to the best of their ability [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2855.8s)]
*  to not invite unwelcome attention [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2860.2s)]
*  and potentially some kind of federal regulation. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2862.52s)]
*  ICE, Gestapo agents coming and knocking down their door. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2867.04s)]
*  So it's additionally difficult to do so right now. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2870.76s)]
*  But I think community organizing and community programs [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2875.4s)]
*  probably go a long way in that regard, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2878.92s)]
*  getting together and showcasing the different cultures [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2880.52s)]
*  that make up Chicago what it is. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2886.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2889.8s)]
*  Hi, my name is Cole and I'm a fourth year undergrad. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2891.96s)]
*  So you kind of touched on this a little bit, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2894.6s)]
*  but your radical stances and very public facing identity [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2896.0s)]
*  has led to a lot of continuous pushback and outrage, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2899.48s)]
*  which seems like you're at least reasonably competent [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2902.4s)]
*  dealing with. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2904.32s)]
*  But I was curious about how do you deal with [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2905.16s)]
*  the emotional turmoil when this affects people close to you, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2909.56s)]
*  like friends or family, how do you deal with emotionally [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2913.96s)]
*  and also what steps do you take [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2916.7599999999998s)]
*  to prevent this from happening? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2918.2s)]
*  Great question. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2919.7999999999997s)]
*  As far as, I mean, I can't speak to people close to me, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2922.64s)]
*  like my former podcast co-host or whatever, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2926.44s)]
*  if that's what you're asking about, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2928.0s)]
*  because they're content creators, so it's different. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2928.96s)]
*  It's a totally different beast. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2931.3599999999997s)]
*  But in terms of disagreements that I have [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2932.92s)]
*  with people in my life, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2935.44s)]
*  I try to manage that to the best of my ability [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2937.88s)]
*  by talking about other things, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2940.92s)]
*  especially if it's a relationship worth preserving, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2943.96s)]
*  especially because I know in the long term, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2947.0s)]
*  I can convince them on some of these positions [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2950.2400000000002s)]
*  as long as I maintain this relationship [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2954.0800000000004s)]
*  without severing that tie. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2956.1200000000003s)]
*  Because if you sever that tie, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2957.88s)]
*  then you're basically losing that battle, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2959.4s)]
*  and that person will probably succumb further and further [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2962.76s)]
*  into reactionary ideology. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2965.6400000000003s)]
*  So it's good that don't revolve around politics [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2967.6800000000003s)]
*  and try to hammer that on to the best of your ability. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2971.96s)]
*  And like I always say, be normal. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2974.7200000000003s)]
*  Because in my normal day-to-day existence, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2977.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't talk about the Ansar Allah militancy [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2980.8s)]
*  in the Red Sea against the Israeli genocide. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2984.76s)]
*  That's not a normal conversation [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2990.5200000000004s)]
*  that's taking place all the time. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2992.5600000000004s)]
*  Having said that, there are certainly disagreements [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2995.0s)]
*  that I have in groups or friends, for example, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=2998.76s)]
*  with respect to trans issues. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3000.96s)]
*  Someone will say an off-color remark, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3003.28s)]
*  and I'll be like, don't do that. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3004.8s)]
*  That's not, come on, you're being wack. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3006.5200000000004s)]
*  There are subtle ways of moderating people in your life [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3009.88s)]
*  to make sure that they understand [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3014.2400000000002s)]
*  that that's not something that you find [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3016.1200000000003s)]
*  to be appropriate or funny. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3018.04s)]
*  And also be cool. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3020.0s)]
*  I think that goes a very long way, I promise. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3021.0s)]
*  Being normal and being cool goes a very long way [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3024.68s)]
*  to make your politics more palatable to everyone around you. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3027.24s)]
*  Thank you, appreciate it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3032.64s)]
*  No problem. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3033.56s)]
*  I love coolness as a thing that's just like, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3034.4s)]
*  just be cool. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3037.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, I know. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3038.52s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't come natural, but it is important. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3041.84s)]
*  Next question. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3047.0s)]
*  Hi, I'm Hayes, on the fourth year in college. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3048.44s)]
*  So my question, Hassan, is that you, for a long time, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3051.24s)]
*  identified as a Marxist, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3054.12s)]
*  or you've identified with Marxism as some capacity. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3056.24s)]
*  Earlier, you raised Orthodox Marxism. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3058.76s)]
*  This was in large part what distinguished you [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3061.12s)]
*  in the Young Turks, but you're also something [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3062.72s)]
*  of a sort of critical left figure [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3065.16s)]
*  within the Democratic Party, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3066.76s)]
*  something of an opposition figure. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3068.4s)]
*  And so I wanna ask about that, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3070.56s)]
*  because there's a way in which the question [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3072.0s)]
*  of capitalist parties for the left [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3073.88s)]
*  is the most traumatic legacy or inheritance [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3076.32s)]
*  of the 20th century. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3079.44s)]
*  I remember back in 2018, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3080.52s)]
*  in spheres kind of adjacent to years on the internet, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3082.48s)]
*  there was an old meme, it went like, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3085.04s)]
*  Barney Rose killed Rosa Luxemburg. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3087.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if anyone up for it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3090.84s)]
*  The spirit is that it was social democrats in Germany [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3092.32s)]
*  which murdered communists in the 1920s, 1910s. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3095.04s)]
*  And it sounds insane, but it's not insane [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3099.6800000000003s)]
*  because it's not true. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3101.92s)]
*  It's insane because Marxism is like off the table [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3102.76s)]
*  in some sense. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3105.2000000000003s)]
*  And so to kind of crystallize, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3106.48s)]
*  but also the people who were saying that [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3109.44s)]
*  by and large supported Barney, right? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3110.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3112.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3113.0400000000004s)]
*  So to crystallize this dilemma, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3113.88s)]
*  there's some sense in which the political thrust [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3115.48s)]
*  of Orthodox Marxism is that capitalist politics [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3118.32s)]
*  and capitalist parties are utterly inadequate [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3121.32s)]
*  to achieve socially necessary, possible, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3123.88s)]
*  and desirable goals, but nonetheless, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3127.2400000000002s)]
*  independent socialist politics are impossible [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3129.32s)]
*  to mount the table. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3131.8s)]
*  So my question is, like, how do you understand [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3132.84s)]
*  the relationship between Marxism [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3134.88s)]
*  and democratic party politics, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3136.44s)]
*  Marxism and capitalist politics more broadly? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3138.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3140.1200000000003s)]
*  Great question. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3141.48s)]
*  Well, Nancy Pelosi is obviously a communist, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3143.36s)]
*  as everybody knows. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3146.48s)]
*  No, I think that in order to build an underlying base [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3148.28s)]
*  of political education necessary for Americans [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3152.4s)]
*  to develop class consciousness, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3155.1200000000003s)]
*  you still need to engage in some semblance of entryism [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3157.36s)]
*  where you have to work with the tools [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3160.32s)]
*  that are readily available at your disposal. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3164.1600000000003s)]
*  This doesn't mean that you cast aside [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3166.36s)]
*  your political message or your ideology or your movement, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3168.88s)]
*  but it's simply to use the preexisting, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3173.7200000000003s)]
*  use the preexisting readily available platforms [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3177.2000000000003s)]
*  that are given to you. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3179.56s)]
*  That's why I'm on Twitch. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3180.4s)]
*  I'm on Amazon, right? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3181.36s)]
*  Like it's a wholly corrupt monopoly [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3182.4s)]
*  that abuses people around the planet [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3188.08s)]
*  and even abuses small business owners [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3190.7200000000003s)]
*  in their predatory pricing schemes they've developed. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3192.32s)]
*  So they're even destroying petty bourgeois people. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3194.84s)]
*  But having said that, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3198.8s)]
*  it's still a viable platform to communicate a message. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3201.7200000000003s)]
*  And that is always my goal, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3207.08s)]
*  is to develop class consciousness [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3210.52s)]
*  and to develop a mechanism of pushback [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3213.04s)]
*  that is still backed by the existing labor force [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3216.4s)]
*  with the hopes that eventually this could [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3220.2000000000003s)]
*  bring about a movement that could resemble a vanguard party [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3224.28s)]
*  or at least turn the Democratic Party by force [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3228.04s)]
*  into a labor party, into a workers party. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3230.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3234.84s)]
*  Hello, thank you for being here and taking our questions. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3237.6s)]
*  So as I'm sure you know, you have a fairly large audience, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3241.8s)]
*  probably more reach within younger people [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3245.12s)]
*  in the Democratic Party than politicians [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3247.36s)]
*  like Kamala Harris do. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3249.6s)]
*  And with that comes a lot of responsibility, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3251.2s)]
*  especially with statements that might be considered [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3253.7599999999998s)]
*  by some to be anti-Semitic or sexist or reactions, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3257.68s)]
*  like laughing in a circumstance where it's not appropriate [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3261.2s)]
*  that might signal to college students [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3264.4s)]
*  that it's appropriate to laugh. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3266.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I'm curious what kind of steps you're taking [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3268.36s)]
*  to ensure that as a messenger who's trusted [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3271.84s)]
*  by so many young people, you're not engaging [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3274.92s)]
*  in any sort of discrimination or anti-Semitism [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3278.0s)]
*  and really engaging in a productive discussion [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3281.7200000000003s)]
*  about politics. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3284.08s)]
*  Great question. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3285.2400000000002s)]
*  I try to stress the importance fairly regularly of, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3286.96s)]
*  especially at a time when anti-Semitism has exploded [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3291.76s)]
*  from Kanye West's latest song all the way down [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3295.84s)]
*  to some of the most prominent conservative pundits [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3299.24s)]
*  openly agitating towards anti-Semitism using cynically [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3302.72s)]
*  what is going on in Gaza to develop a heinous message [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3307.4799999999996s)]
*  that attributes all of those crimes to Jewish people. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3312.6s)]
*  I find myself virtually every day speaking out against that [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3317.8399999999997s)]
*  and decoupling Zionism and Judaism on a regular basis [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3322.68s)]
*  in an effort to educate people that might find themselves [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3327.28s)]
*  on the whims of unexamined anti-Semitic tendencies. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3331.2400000000002s)]
*  In terms of laughing at certain things [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3334.92s)]
*  or coming across as anti-Semitic, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3336.96s)]
*  there are a lot of groups and a lot of people that, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3339.76s)]
*  especially in the online space, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3344.96s)]
*  that predispose themselves with drama. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3346.52s)]
*  So they're always going to try to find [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3348.78s)]
*  the most nefarious frame to present me [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3350.6400000000003s)]
*  in the worst light possible. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3353.36s)]
*  But I always say the antidote to all of that [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3354.94s)]
*  is to simply pay attention for an extended period of time [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3357.38s)]
*  to what I'm saying and you will very quickly realize [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3360.58s)]
*  that you might have gotten duped into believing [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3363.7000000000003s)]
*  a certain thing that I believe that I definitely do not. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3366.66s)]
*  So in terms of nefarious clipping [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3370.3s)]
*  or things that get clipped out of context, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3372.58s)]
*  there's not really much I can do about that, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3374.14s)]
*  unfortunately, it's just the name of the game. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3376.2200000000003s)]
*  And I just try to put my best foot forward [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3378.98s)]
*  to the best of my ability and hope that people [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3382.46s)]
*  can still maintain charitability [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3385.78s)]
*  and understand where I'm coming from. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3387.62s)]
*  But yeah, as far as education goes, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3389.78s)]
*  I think it's a very important part of my commentary [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3392.58s)]
*  to constantly talk about the growing dangers, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3396.46s)]
*  the canary in the coal mine of anti-Semitism, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3400.3s)]
*  which is usually a first step [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3402.66s)]
*  towards growing fascist ideology. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3404.9s)]
*  Thank you, great question. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3408.86s)]
*  Hi Hassan, my name is Danny, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3410.38s)]
*  I'm a third year at the college [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3411.74s)]
*  and I don't know if you're aware, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3412.9399999999996s)]
*  but the university recently received [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3414.06s)]
*  a very hefty free speech fund. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3415.62s)]
*  And when I told my roommate that you were coming here, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3418.18s)]
*  she said that you were a product of that free speech fund. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3420.14s)]
*  And this university has made itself a reputation [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3424.14s)]
*  for handling student movements [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3426.58s)]
*  on the notes of Palestinian struggle [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3428.22s)]
*  in a very particular way. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3429.7799999999997s)]
*  And I was wondering if you ever felt [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3431.5s)]
*  tokenized by the university as a way for them to be like, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3433.2599999999998s)]
*  oh look, we care, like it's a gacha moment for you. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3435.74s)]
*  Well, just as a fact point, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3439.66s)]
*  he's not here from the fund or from other, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3440.78s)]
*  he's here from the IOP and because- [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3443.1800000000003s)]
*  Are you tokenizing me instead? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3445.3s)]
*  Yeah, and because I told him, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3446.38s)]
*  because I asked him to come. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3447.7000000000003s)]
*  No, he asked me- [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3448.7000000000003s)]
*  No, I think that this is actually the opposite of that. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3449.5400000000004s)]
*  We're here to gauge the earnest point of that discussion [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3451.5s)]
*  and so I just want to say factually, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3454.5400000000004s)]
*  that's not how we can, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3456.78s)]
*  but do you want to answer that yourself? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3457.6600000000003s)]
*  No, I mean, I don't know anything [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3459.1000000000004s)]
*  about the free speech fund. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3460.5s)]
*  Are you, where's my money? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3461.7000000000003s)]
*  Where's my- [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3463.5s)]
*  Where's my- [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3464.34s)]
*  If you're not, we're both asking the same question. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3465.78s)]
*  Yeah, no, I love his dad, he's great [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3469.02s)]
*  and he wanted me to come and speak to you guys [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3471.38s)]
*  so I was like, yeah, I'll do it. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3473.18s)]
*  It wasn't like a- [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3474.7s)]
*  And very earnestly, I think it's just an effort for, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3475.54s)]
*  places like the Institute of Politics [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3478.7s)]
*  to be where students are [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3479.9s)]
*  and to engage in those types of discussions. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3480.94s)]
*  So I think it's the opposite of tokenization. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3482.46s)]
*  I think it's earnest. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3485.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3487.7s)]
*  No problem. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3488.7s)]
*  Thanks for speaking with us today. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3492.66s)]
*  My name is Robbie, I'm a second year at the college. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3494.3s)]
*  So a few weeks ago, I witnessed a student [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3497.66s)]
*  rip down a poster on campus that said, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3499.8199999999997s)]
*  come learn about Judaism, simply that. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3501.62s)]
*  When I told individual Assami, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3504.42s)]
*  he told me, a Jewish student, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3506.8599999999997s)]
*  that I was sympathizing with Nazis. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3508.8999999999996s)]
*  So my question to you, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3510.3399999999997s)]
*  do you think antisemitism in college campuses is a problem [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3511.7799999999997s)]
*  and how should we work to combat it? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3514.98s)]
*  Oh, antisemitism is absolutely a problem on college campuses. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3517.42s)]
*  It's a problem everywhere. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3520.74s)]
*  It's just, it's like any other bigotry. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3522.22s)]
*  If left unexamined, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3525.14s)]
*  and especially at a time when material conditions worsen, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3526.98s)]
*  it's going to get significantly worse. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3529.94s)]
*  In terms of the packaging of Israel's actions with Judaism, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3532.58s)]
*  I think that this is a common issue [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3537.3399999999997s)]
*  that at least Jewish members of my community [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3540.2599999999998s)]
*  are always struggling with, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3543.62s)]
*  where they talk about the unfortunate fears that they feel [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3546.3399999999997s)]
*  as far as like people associating them [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3551.8199999999997s)]
*  with the actions of Israel. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3554.46s)]
*  And this is a great example of that, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3555.66s)]
*  where this person absolutely was doing that. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3557.18s)]
*  Where this person thinks like, oh, you're a Nazi. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3561.7s)]
*  You love Israel because you're defending a sign that says, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3564.14s)]
*  come learn about Judaism. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3570.26s)]
*  Judaism has nothing to do with Israel. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3571.98s)]
*  Judaism has nothing to do with Zionism. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3574.82s)]
*  And I feel like the more we educate people. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3576.66s)]
*  Sorry, man, I gotta speak up, man. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3580.66s)]
*  I came back from New York, I went to Rutgers, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3582.3s)]
*  and I made a song about the hostage Jewish. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3584.74s)]
*  What do we say at the end of Passover? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3586.38s)]
*  We say next year in Jerusalem. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3589.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3591.46s)]
*  We're trying to actually engage in some question and answer. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3593.02s)]
*  Can we, you're skipping all the folks who stared in line [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3595.18s)]
*  and are patiently trying to ask their question. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3597.9s)]
*  No, no, no, we don't need to boo y'all. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3600.1s)]
*  It's okay, it's okay. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3601.54s)]
*  Is bro about to rap? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3606.06s)]
*  You need to recognize everything we're doing here. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3607.62s)]
*  Bro, I mean, at least I know a lot of you can't. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3613.14s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3616.14s)]
*  Let me ask you something. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3618.14s)]
*  Let me ask you something. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3620.5s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3621.3399999999997s)]
*  Not that person, not that person. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3622.18s)]
*  The student who raised the question. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3624.22s)]
*  Raised the question about the Judaism sign. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3627.22s)]
*  Do you feel comfortable being associated with that dude? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3631.22s)]
*  Israel is a very important part of Judaism. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3639.2999999999997s)]
*  I do not agree with what the Israeli government is doing, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3641.98s)]
*  but Israel is very important to Judaism [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3645.58s)]
*  as a home of democracy in the Middle East [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3648.14s)]
*  and as a safe place for Jews after the Holocaust. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3650.34s)]
*  And Jewish people need Israel to exist. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3653.94s)]
*  That is what I believe. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3656.58s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3657.58s)]
*  Now we're gonna focus on questions, y'all. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3658.42s)]
*  So next question. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3660.5s)]
*  It was my bad, I asked the question. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3661.34s)]
*  No, no, no, I get it. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3662.46s)]
*  Thank you for asking the question too. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3663.78s)]
*  Last one you're gonna follow up. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3669.18s)]
*  Hi, my name's Colton. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3671.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm a first year at the college. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3672.58s)]
*  My favorite part of your ideology [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3673.94s)]
*  has always been your incessant focus on charitability [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3676.62s)]
*  and I guess it's what you talk about all the time. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3684.06s)]
*  But for the average American voter [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3686.7s)]
*  that we talked about in this talk, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3688.54s)]
*  who only votes on emotion, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3690.34s)]
*  who doesn't have the time to engage in that, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3691.7400000000002s)]
*  they are more susceptible to the conflation [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3693.98s)]
*  that Sam Seder just talked about [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3697.2200000000003s)]
*  in the conversation you had with your former co-host. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3699.42s)]
*  So when you lead your examples by case studies [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3702.9s)]
*  and evidence and all these things [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3706.78s)]
*  that those voters whose vote counts just as much [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3708.34s)]
*  as everyone in this room aren't receptive to, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3710.98s)]
*  how do you adjust your framework to supply evidence [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3714.06s)]
*  that is less academic but still combats that inflation [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3718.14s)]
*  and still showcases that charitability? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3721.5s)]
*  Good question. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3723.5s)]
*  I think it doesn't have to be rigorous and academic. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3725.1800000000003s)]
*  Like when we're making an argument, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3731.26s)]
*  it doesn't always have to, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3733.6600000000003s)]
*  you can rely on emotional appeals. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3734.58s)]
*  Like you don't have to be a robot. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3736.42s)]
*  Like there's no debate moderator [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3739.1800000000003s)]
*  that's going to tell you like that's to do that. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3741.1000000000004s)]
*  Like you can do whatever you want. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3743.34s)]
*  It's like a cheat code really. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3744.7400000000002s)]
*  Like you can use all the logical fallacies [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3746.7000000000003s)]
*  at your disposal if you want to explain something to people. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3749.46s)]
*  It's very effective. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3753.34s)]
*  That's what most people online that love debating do. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3754.38s)]
*  They try to rationalize those sorts of things, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3756.6200000000003s)]
*  but that's pretty much what they're engaging in. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3758.82s)]
*  And as far as like maintaining endless charitability, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3762.1000000000004s)]
*  my starting position on this is that I understand [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3767.5800000000004s)]
*  that this is a settler colonial nation [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3770.94s)]
*  that was designed by slavers and was built on the fundamentals [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3774.7400000000002s)]
*  of erasing the indigenous population. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3780.06s)]
*  And a lot of social conditioning plays a role [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3784.58s)]
*  in our everyday existence to normalize that sort of thing. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3787.18s)]
*  And therefore, of course, people are going to have [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3790.9799999999996s)]
*  a starting position that is reactionary [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3795.14s)]
*  on a lot of these issues. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3797.22s)]
*  So as long as you remind yourself of that [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3798.7s)]
*  and take on that emotional labor, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3801.3399999999997s)]
*  you'll be able to overcome this. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3804.54s)]
*  You'll be able to make a convincing argument [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3806.4599999999996s)]
*  like I said, if you're normal and cool [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3810.38s)]
*  and try to talk to people and meet them where they're at [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3813.1s)]
*  and recognize some of the common points of struggle [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3816.5s)]
*  and pain that they experience, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3820.74s)]
*  you can always package that back up [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3822.34s)]
*  to whatever kind of social malady [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3823.9s)]
*  that they are representing and move them away from that. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3827.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3832.74s)]
*  Hi, I'm also from the college, work here. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3835.74s)]
*  I remember you guys both mentioned, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3839.62s)]
*  or there was a topic that was raised [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3842.06s)]
*  about disenfranchisement, feeling like hopeless. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3845.06s)]
*  We bought into whatever a campaign [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3848.9s)]
*  and then another campaign on the left, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3850.82s)]
*  on the right, both sides or whatever. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3852.54s)]
*  And then there was also the question, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3854.66s)]
*  I'm sorry, the topic of, oh, do people actually [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3857.02s)]
*  vote on policy? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3861.1s)]
*  I wanted to ask to what extent do you think [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3862.58s)]
*  the populist movements, you're Peter Thiel, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3867.1s)]
*  you're David Brooks, you for example, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3870.38s)]
*  to what extent do you, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3873.98s)]
*  I feel like that was an interesting question. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3875.46s)]
*  That is a crazy spectrum. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3876.2999999999997s)]
*  It is kind of crazy. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3878.14s)]
*  To what extent do you think it's kind of like a response [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3880.2599999999998s)]
*  to a global phenomenon, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3885.06s)]
*  but then maybe like projecting on something else [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3887.58s)]
*  between those different groups. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3890.34s)]
*  To what extent do you think we can avoid [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3892.66s)]
*  some big disaster before people actually start voting [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3895.34s)]
*  on policy, start thinking about what we can do together, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3899.38s)]
*  not just blaming somebody else? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3902.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, I don't think that there is any way [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3905.6600000000003s)]
*  to vote on policy right now. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3907.9s)]
*  That's at the heart of the problem [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3909.26s)]
*  with the Democratic Party especially, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3911.98s)]
*  is that they're not crafting a message [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3914.06s)]
*  that revolves around discernible policies [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3917.82s)]
*  that you can point to. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3921.38s)]
*  Like you can do that for Bernie. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3922.9s)]
*  You can say he's for Medicare for all. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3924.5s)]
*  He's for free college. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3925.86s)]
*  He said that for 80 years, right? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3927.06s)]
*  But you can't really pin down the Democrats [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3930.34s)]
*  on issues like that. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3933.26s)]
*  So then because they do not have a coherent [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3934.62s)]
*  policy focused message like that, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3938.2200000000003s)]
*  no like tangible legislative action [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3940.62s)]
*  that you can associate them with, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3942.7400000000002s)]
*  they are associated with whatever [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3944.18s)]
*  the Republicans present them as. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3946.42s)]
*  Kamala Harris doesn't care about you [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3947.94s)]
*  because she's too busy trying to do transgender [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3949.34s)]
*  bottom surgeries for Guatemalans. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3952.42s)]
*  And it's like all it takes is like one clip [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3955.06s)]
*  from an ACLU seminar that Kamala Harris [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3957.62s)]
*  answered that question on for Americans to go, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3960.46s)]
*  oh yeah, that is weird. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3963.34s)]
*  Why does she care only about that? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3964.46s)]
*  I don't think she cares about anything. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3965.98s)]
*  If Kamala Harris had policies that you could [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3968.1400000000003s)]
*  associate with her that truly address [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3970.82s)]
*  some of the issues that people are experiencing [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3974.7400000000002s)]
*  in this country, everyone could just go, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3977.1s)]
*  oh shut up, that's not, it's nothing. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3979.1400000000003s)]
*  Like okay, that's one answer that she gave. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3980.7799999999997s)]
*  Why do you care about this? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3982.62s)]
*  She cares about Medicare for all. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3983.8999999999996s)]
*  Do you not want healthcare? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3985.22s)]
*  So that's what I want the Democrats to get to [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3986.62s)]
*  so that they can actually more successfully [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3990.1s)]
*  be a counterbalance towards growing fascism. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3993.1s)]
*  You're right, if they don't do that, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=3995.9399999999996s)]

*  spiraling towards barbarism. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4000.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, recognizing that some people [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4003.2999999999997s)]
*  don't just vote in policy and some vote in vibes, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4007.22s)]
*  there's one answer to change that. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4008.9799999999996s)]
*  The other answer is to have better vibes. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4010.7s)]
*  That too. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4012.5s)]
*  Like Barack Obama spoke to people who were [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4013.3399999999997s)]
*  voting for all of a whole bunch of reasons. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4016.2599999999998s)]
*  No, no, no, no, but I'm saying a successful [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4018.4599999999996s)]
*  electoral politician does all of the above [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4020.1s)]
*  is what I'm saying. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4022.2999999999997s)]
*  So that's the only example I'm doing. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4023.2599999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4025.8199999999997s)]
*  Hi, Azan, thank you for doing this. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4027.8599999999997s)]
*  My name's Lance, I'm a second year in the college [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4029.18s)]
*  and growing up in a rural area during this time, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4031.22s)]
*  I've seen the polarization of young men particularly [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4035.1s)]
*  and I was wondering how the Democrats could begin [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4039.18s)]
*  to activate some of these young men [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4042.3799999999997s)]
*  or bring them to their side and also when is [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4044.8199999999997s)]
*  the Subnautica playthrough going to get finished? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4047.42s)]
*  I don't even know what that second part is. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4049.98s)]
*  Subnautica is a game I played, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4054.42s)]
*  but I got too scared to finish it. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4056.5s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4057.98s)]
*  It was very scary in my defense. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4058.8199999999997s)]
*  It was a very scary game. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4060.62s)]
*  It's underwater horror. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4062.5s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4064.8599999999997s)]
*  Young men. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4066.02s)]
*  About young men, I think that there are a lot of people [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4067.34s)]
*  that are genuinely incredibly insecure [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4074.1400000000003s)]
*  in the Manosphere space that present themselves [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4076.94s)]
*  as this hyper masculine idea of what a 14 year old [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4080.5s)]
*  would think is a cool person. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4084.6600000000003s)]
*  The best antidote to that is to focus on hobbies [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4088.26s)]
*  that are productive and improve yourself, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4093.26s)]
*  improve your body, engage in the act [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4096.860000000001s)]
*  of constantly choosing to better yourself [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4102.26s)]
*  and be a positive figure for people around you [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4105.66s)]
*  and that's what I try to do at least [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4108.14s)]
*  and I think if more people were to do that, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4109.780000000001s)]
*  their men, young men in particular [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4112.46s)]
*  would be more responsive to that. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4114.58s)]
*  Gotcha and how can the Democrats actually do this? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4117.14s)]
*  We only have a couple more minutes. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4119.820000000001s)]
*  Can we just stick with one question? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4120.74s)]
*  Thank you though, I appreciate it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4121.62s)]
*  That is the last question. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4122.46s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4123.5s)]

*  My name is Cassidy, I'm a techie here at the college. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4125.94s)]
*  You know, there's the old joke about, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4128.82s)]
*  to be a real leftist you have to read [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4130.7s)]
*  X, Y, Z pieces of literature. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4132.54s)]
*  You have to know all these things or whatever. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4134.18s)]
*  But I've also seen a lot of attribution [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4137.3s)]
*  of the growth of the younger right wing base [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4139.18s)]
*  with the decade old now alt-right pipeline [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4141.86s)]
*  and with modern incarnations as we're briefly spoken on. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4146.06s)]
*  I was wondering how you think it would be possible [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4150.139999999999s)]
*  to cultivate long lasting leftist spaces online [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4152.9s)]
*  when there's such high perception of barriers to entry? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4156.82s)]
*  I mean, I don't think I engage in dense literature [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4161.94s)]
*  and I don't think anyone should really do that [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4166.5s)]
*  because the entire- [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4168.54s)]
*  Incredible sentence at university. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4170.7s)]
*  Yeah, well I mean like when you're communicating, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4172.179999999999s)]
*  when you are engaging in the act of propaganda, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4176.900000000001s)]
*  not as like the way that people understand propaganda, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4180.1s)]
*  but as just like telling a message, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4182.18s)]
*  I think it's on you to simplify said message [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4185.1s)]
*  rather than try to point people [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4188.660000000001s)]
*  in the direction of dense literature [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4192.02s)]
*  that's like very hard to tackle. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4193.5s)]
*  And I try to do that with everything that I engage with, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4195.9800000000005s)]
*  whether it's like me doing crime reacts [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4199.9400000000005s)]
*  or you know, reacting to a YouTube video. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4202.9800000000005s)]
*  This is what I believe, so this is my worldview. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4206.54s)]
*  So I try to bake that understanding of the world [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4208.9s)]
*  into everything that I do [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4213.38s)]
*  and slowly but surely hope that people [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4215.5s)]
*  develop this different perspective. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4217.82s)]
*  And I think everyone can do that, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4219.62s)]
*  but it does require a little bit of reading ahead of time [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4220.98s)]
*  in order to get there [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4224.0599999999995s)]
*  because to be able to describe difficult concepts, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4225.58s)]
*  difficult to broach concepts in simplified terms, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4228.9s)]
*  you have to develop a very good understanding [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4231.58s)]
*  of said concepts. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4233.62s)]
*  So it's good to read, sorry for saying, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4234.98s)]
*  but when you're engaging normies, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4240.179999999999s)]
*  you probably shouldn't point to dense academic literature, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4244.339999999999s)]
*  but instead try to summarize the positions that you know [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlAOljU4Vc&t=4250.099999999999s)]
