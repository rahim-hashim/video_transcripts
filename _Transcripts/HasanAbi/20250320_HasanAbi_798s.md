**HasanAbi:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ)
*  the country because they looked through his phone and they found out that he had criticized [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's elimination of grants. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=3.92s)]
*  I think there actually is support for it because there is, because of the free speech grounds [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=7.08s)]
*  on it, because of the free speech grounds, because when ICE came to try to pick up in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil's case, when they tried to pick him up, they offered no warrant, these [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=19.12s)]
*  were unmarked people, there were no charges. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=24.2s)]
*  And so you have Senator Durbin and Senate Judiciary, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=27.56s)]

*  Here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=52.36s)]

*  I got you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=54.36s)]

*  Take a seat. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=62.16s)]
*  This is the chairs that they had, I'm sorry. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=63.16s)]
*  No, that's fine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=66.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=67.16s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls and enbies, we have Bernie Sanders and AOC in the building. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=68.16s)]
*  You guys are about to go up and speak at another one of the rallies that you've been doing, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  the Fighting Oligarchy Tour. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  And I'm very excited to have you here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  Vegas, specifically for me, has a lot of importance because I always say it's like the last time [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  that I felt really hopeful about the future of this country because I was outdoor knocking [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  for you along with the Chapo boys as well in the primaries. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=98.96s)]
*  And we did pretty well, huh? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=103.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=104.96s)]
*  And everyone kept saying, oh, the Culinary Union is not going to vote. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=105.96s)]
*  The rank and file very clearly was swinging in your direction. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=108.52s)]
*  And in spite of the media attacks, you obviously pulled through and then COVID and then all [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=112.52s)]
*  hell broke loose, obviously. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=120.42s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=121.92s)]
*  You don't have a lot of time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=124.52s)]
*  So and I'm sure that we'll get to talk a little bit more in the future as well. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=125.72s)]
*  But I wanted to I went to Japan recently and I got both of you guys gifts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=130.32s)]
*  I actually have another gift for you, but unfortunately, I don't have your gift. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=135.92s)]
*  The actual gift here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=138.72s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=140.92s)]
*  This one's for you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=141.92s)]
*  This is a Palestinian movement in Japan. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=142.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=146.92s)]
*  Solidarity with Palestine. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=147.92s)]
*  And this is a little train for public transit. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=148.92s)]
*  I have a Japanese Communist Party pin for you as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=152.52s)]
*  But unfortunately, because I went over there and I checked out their headquarters. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=155.32s)]
*  But what are you guys trying to accomplish with these rallies? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=160.12s)]
*  Let's get started. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=165.52s)]
*  I mean, I think that what the kind of moment that we're in and also something that Trump [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=166.52s)]
*  was able to exploit was really practicing, even though he doesn't believe in working [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  class politics. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=180.52s)]
*  They had a very focused working class strategy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think for a while, like Democratic Party clearly didn't wasn't effective at that wasn't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=185.72s)]
*  successful at that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=191.52s)]
*  And I think one of the things that we're here to do is to actually rally a class conscious [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=193.08s)]
*  movement to bring people together and to show that we can fight for a better future, not [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  in marginalizing and attacking people, you know, marginalized people, but actually in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=207.08s)]
*  rejecting the differences that we have to come together in common cause and to organize [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=214.28s)]
*  folks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, I agree. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  To me, this country faces the worst set of crises that we have faced in a very, very, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  very long time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=231.68s)]
*  We are looking at a nation which is now oligarchic and they don't hide it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I must give them credit for it, but you know, they're there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=239.68s)]
*  Mr. Moss, the richest guy in the world is running all over the place, cutting veterans, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=242.48s)]
*  the needs of veterans, cutting after Social Security. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=247.6s)]
*  There are 30 in addition to must, you got 13 nominees of Trump, the head major agencies [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=251.1s)]
*  are all billionaires. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=257.1s)]
*  So you got a government clearly no embarrassment of the billionaire class by the billionaire [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=258.1s)]
*  class for the billionaire class. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=262.4s)]
*  And then what is, I would hope would be upsetting to all Americans no matter what their politics [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=264.08s)]
*  may be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=270.44s)]
*  You can be a conservative about this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=271.44s)]
*  You got a president who is moving us very rapidly into an authoritarian form of society. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=272.94s)]
*  I mean, you don't sue media in America because they say something bad about you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=279.14s)]
*  Alexandria and I got about 500 lawsuits there, but we happen to believe in democracy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=285.44s)]
*  You don't ask for the impeachment of judges because they issue a ruling which you disagree [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=292.14s)]
*  with. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=298.84s)]
*  So it is, these are tough times. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=301.18s)]
*  And what we've got to do is rally the working families of this country to stand up to oligarchy [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=305.18s)]
*  and to demand that we have an economy and a government that works for all, not just [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=310.6s)]
*  the people on top. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=314.52s)]
*  So one way that this government, I think the Trump administration has been able to very [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=315.8s)]
*  expertly tackle these issues is by using an entry point of pre-established marginalization. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=320.18s)]
*  Obviously the erosion of civil liberties is happening all around, but in terms of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=328.68s)]
*  attacking free speech, a fundamental principle that I think all Americans agree on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=334.04s)]
*  And the way that he's done this, the way that this administration has attacked free speech [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=340.8s)]
*  is by doing something that previously has only been utilized in the darkest times of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=344.94s)]
*  American history. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=350.64s)]
*  I'm of course talking about Mahmoud Khalil potentially being deported or at least having [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=351.64s)]
*  his green card revoked for basically nothing. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=357.68s)]
*  The administration has all but admitted for no discernible reason other than the fact [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=363.24s)]
*  that he was the lead negotiator on the student side, the student protesters at Columbia campus. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  On top of that, just like in Nazi Germany, the Trump administration is now trying to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=373.8s)]
*  put up an academic receivership and take charge and take control over different institutions [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=378.56s)]
*  within Columbia. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=386.44s)]
*  And I feel like this is a grave mistake. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=387.44s)]
*  Do you feel like the Democrats have any sort of interest in fighting back against this? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=390.28s)]
*  Regardless of what their opinion might be on Israel, the fact is that this is greatly [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=396.56s)]
*  going to expand. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=402.08s)]
*  And it's simply just the entry point. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=404.36s)]
*  The Palestine conversation is simply an entry point that has at least some semblance of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=405.88s)]
*  institutional backing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=410.7s)]
*  But it's obvious to me that they're going to go after a lot of other people, including [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=412.86s)]
*  but not limited to the French researcher according to Lamont that was denied entry into the country [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=418.1s)]
*  because they looked through his phone and they found out that he had criticized Trump's [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  elimination of grants. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=426.66s)]
*  I think there actually is support for it because there is, because of the free speech grounds [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=429.1s)]
*  on it, because of the free speech grounds, because when ICE came to try to pick up in [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=436.14s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil's case, when they tried to pick him up, they offered no warrant. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=441.52s)]
*  These were unmarked people. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=446.21999999999997s)]
*  There were no charges. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  And so you have Senator Durbin and Senate Judiciary, right, Bernie? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=449.58s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  He is the ranking member. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  I believe they released a statement talking about how they want to move on this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  But I also think that it goes without saying that there is still profound money and interest [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  that remains dedicated on both sides of the aisle in trying to marginalize and also conflate [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=467.66s)]
*  criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=474.66s)]
*  And we have to be very aware of that, too. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=478.02s)]
*  We have very limited time and you guys have to... [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=480.98s)]
*  Do I need to... [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=483.38s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=484.38s)]
*  You got no time. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=485.38s)]
*  I'm going up. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=486.38s)]
*  I'm going up. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=487.38s)]
*  It's my turn. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=488.38s)]
*  Just a minute. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=489.38s)]
*  All right, perfect. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=490.38s)]
*  One question I actually wanted to ask you before we let you go is you've also talked [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=491.7s)]
*  about... you've talked recently with the New York Times about what the future of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=497.08s)]
*  Democratic Party looks like and what maybe young enterprising individuals must do. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=502.58s)]
*  And I believe you... [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=508.7s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing here. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=509.98s)]
*  You said something along the lines of running as an independent rather than utilizing the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=511.18s)]
*  party in your shoes. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=514.66s)]
*  For me, that's not a very radical concept because I am the longest serving in the American [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=515.66s)]
*  congressional history and I've always run as an independent. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=520.46s)]
*  Look, I think the Democrats over the years deserve credit for the work they've done on [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=524.14s)]
*  women's rights, on gay rights, on civil liberty... [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=528.98s)]
*  civil rights in general, fighting bigotry. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=533.26s)]
*  They deserve credit and they've made progress. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=535.5400000000001s)]
*  But I don't think anybody with a straight face can tell you that they've stood up for [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=538.82s)]
*  the working class of this country. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=541.74s)]
*  And I think that's why so many working class people have drifted into the Republican [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=543.4200000000001s)]
*  Party, not because they believe in tax breaks for billionaires or they don't believe that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=548.14s)]
*  climate change is real. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=551.9s)]
*  If they look at the Democrats and there's not much there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=553.3000000000001s)]
*  So what my view is, is people should think about running as they want. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=556.5s)]
*  Progressive independents should run as progressive Democrats, but don't necessarily feel that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  you have to run within the Democratic Party. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=569.7s)]
*  And I think, as you may recall, in Nebraska, a fellow named Dan Osborne ran a really, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=572.94s)]
*  really powerful campaign as an independent, running as a very proud trade unionist, running [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=578.1s)]
*  on economic issues. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=584.86s)]
*  And he did extremely well, much better than anyone had anticipated. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=586.0600000000001s)]
*  So that was my point. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=589.74s)]
*  And I think it makes sense. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=591.14s)]
*  Do you feel like there is any sort of momentum to break through the duopoly in this structure [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=592.82s)]
*  as someone who has run as an independent? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=598.46s)]
*  It is. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=600.2199999999999s)]
*  It's a long discussion. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=601.7399999999999s)]
*  If you're asking me, do I think we could start a third party tomorrow? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=603.0999999999999s)]
*  I don't, for a lot of reasons having to do with restrictions in various states making [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=605.7399999999999s)]
*  it almost impossible. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=610.7399999999999s)]
*  But I think what you're seeing is massive discontent with both the Republican Party and [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=612.62s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=618.38s)]
*  More and more people are looking for, I think, independent alternatives. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=619.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=623.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=623.4599999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=624.2199999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  Listen, great to see you. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=625.3s)]
*  We're going to hopefully do this again very soon. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=626.3399999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=629.2199999999999s)]
*  Take care. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=629.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=629.9s)]
*  We'll go over to the rally now. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=630.14s)]
*  We got to get your mic off. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=631.5799999999999s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=635.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=636.9399999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=639.06s)]
*  Move on. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=641.78s)]
*  Chatters. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=645.54s)]
*  That was Bernie Sanders and AOC. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=646.98s)]
*  There was obviously a lot more discussion that I wanted to get to, but unfortunately, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=650.26s)]
*  they literally are going up right now. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=655.5s)]
*  So it was short. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=658.54s)]
*  Hopefully, one of these days when I have a little bit or Bernie has a little bit more [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  time, I'll be able to conduct a longer interview with both AOC and Bernie. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=668.9s)]
*  But having said that, that's what I think we need to do like a like a podcast almost, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=679.3s)]
*  you know? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=685.86s)]
*  Purposely Dodge? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=688.26s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, bro. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=688.98s)]
*  They're talking. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=690.06s)]
*  They're literally about to. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=690.86s)]
*  We're going to film them in a second. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=692.62s)]
*  They're about to go on the stage. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=696.8199999999999s)]
*  Like their schedule is airtight. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=700.42s)]
*  Like Bernie flew in and got off the plane, rushed over here. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=704.62s)]
*  And because they had given me, because they told me that we were going to be able to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=711.3s)]
*  talk to them, that they still literally pushed back the entire march, the entire rally. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=715.54s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=724.02s)]
*  Anyway, having said that, we'll go over there, we'll go into the rally, we'll film the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=731.14s)]
*  rally, and then by the end of it, we'll I think we'll just let me see. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=739.54s)]
*  Let me talk to my let me talk to the production people to see if we can potentially [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=746.66s)]
*  potentially stream the rally. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=756.4599999999999s)]
*  You're not Mike, are you March? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=762.5799999999999s)]
*  OK, all right. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=764.18s)]
*  March is talking to the team right now. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=765.5s)]
*  They're playing tears for fears again. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=770.54s)]
*  Rush the stage. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=779.26s)]
*  They're going to use this space for another interview soon. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=784.38s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, we're going to get up. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qv2m5ZgOQ&t=787.62s)]
